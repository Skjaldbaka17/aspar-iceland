{"G-Dragon":["You have to believe in yourself, challenge yourself, and push yourself until the very end; that's the only way you'll succeed.","In order to keep my creativity alive, I just try to enjoy life to the fullest.","Whatever I like, even after a long time, I still like it. And I reminisce about the moment when I first heard it. That's what I love. Just remembering those moments.","It doesn't matter what kind of clothes you put on: if you're a stylish individual, you're going to preserve that.","I'm not even sure who I really am sometimes.","I would only create clothes myself if I felt I could do something really different - create a new style subculture for my generation - and that is very ambitious.","You can't explain Chanel. It's a verb.","Carpe diem, you know.","I always think today is better than yesterday, and tomorrow is better than today.","The sights you can find here in Paris are second to none.","I will keep - try - to be, like, on a new level every day.","If you look at the brands that I like, there are brands I like because of the clothes; then, there are brands I like because of their attitude and mentality.","G-Dragon is a fancy person. People don't expect the upright image of G-Dragon. Kwon Ji Yong is an introvert and has lots of things going on in his head.","As a musician myself, I wouldn't be confident if I received some other composers' song, because I choose to express myself through the music that I make.","Interestingly, when I look at pictures of me when I was five or six years old, I think I look pretty stylish.","I would write down the lyrics to 'C.R.E.A.M.' in Korean - not translating it, but phonetically writing out each word. I didn't know what they were saying, so I would just write everything down as I heard it. I would recite it and imitate it like that. That's how I started to write my own raps.","It would be better to be recognized first for music, but people go with what they like. If I'm here because I'm recognized more so as a style icon, then, if I'm smart enough, I will use this opportunity to share more insight about my music.","When I perform as a solo, I think a lot about what I always wanted to do but have not done yet.","I study my fans all the time, and what I learn from them will definitely be reflected in my future work.","I now know that inspirations must come from everywhere.","The most important thing is knowing what you are good at.","I am usually positive and optimistic. If I get stressed or some results are not so good, I let it go by thinking, 'Oh well, it can be better next time.' I don't worry a lot, and I'm not too serious about anything.","I started out as a child actor. Back then, I didn't have a manager or company, and I couldn't even dream of having a stylist. My mom made and bought the clothes I would wear. I think that was probably when I first got into fashion.","There are times even I am a bit embarrassed by my look.","As a rapper, I was heavily influenced by American rap albums. But for songs that are more melody-driven, I get my inspiration from Korean albums.","There are albums that I like because of specific songs, but then there are albums that I like as a complete body of work. 'Ghetto Fabolous' is an album I lived with daily.","Americans might not understand, but within Korea, Big Bang was one of the first artists to make their own production. We have our own interpretation of our own songs. We do our own thing.","We are Korean, so obviously they call our music K-pop. But we never thought of our music as K-pop. Our music is just our music.","When I was still a student, I came out of a performing arts high school, and the female students who were doing traditional dance and ballet were so beautiful. They were beautiful, starting from their postures.","I want to have daughter, and if I do, I want to make sure she learns ballet.","I want to do something that can support all the people in Korea and the world who see us and are inspired to do their own thing.","When I was young and didn't know any English, I was drawn by the energy and power of foreign songs and their melodies.","It would be ridiculous for anyone to consider me the face of Korean art.","I want a daughter no matter what.","We make our own music, and the songs appeal to the public well, and the public likes them.","Kwon Ji Yong is searching for the comfort and reliable people that G-Dragon doesn't have offstage.","People may see me as a luxurious star, but I am always thinking I can be represented by my psychological world that is fraught with vanity, loneliness, and always feels inadequate.","I was about nine years old when I first heard Wu-Tang's 'C.R.E.A.M.' Before that, I didn't know anything about rap or hip-hop. I was just into Korean pop.","There was this hip-hop collective called People Crew. And at the time in Korea, there was no real place to access rap music. So People Crew used to host this summer school program, which taught rapping and dancing. I begged my mom to attend that school to learn how to rap.","I just listened to regular commercial music from Korea. I would just follow the choreographed dance routines. I didn't have any ambitions of pursuing rapping. I liked dancing, so I did that.","I occasionally rapped along to some homegrown Korean rap. And then a friend introduced me to Wu-Tang and played me 'Enter the 36th Chambers.' It was very shocking. And then I started to look for different albums. This was pre-Internet, so it's hard to find the music, and it was even harder to find music videos.","I wasn't trying to be famous when I started making music. I mean, that wasn't the first thing I wanted.","Korean people, including me, want to go faster and faster - in music, in fashion, in art, too.","We always focus on the quality of music because as long as the content is good, then the interest will be there.","Just like anyone else, I want privacy at times, but I understand that I am a celebrity.","I am a songwriter and producer, and though you have to be personal in everything you do, you always having to look at things from another's perspective.","I don't know what I would have been doing if I was not in YG, but I think I would be doing something artistic.","Before I was physically there in different countries to meet my fans in person, I didn't really realize how famous I was.","I just try to look good always.","I've come to realize ways of making music without being excessive.","Whether it's music or fashion, the older I get, I realize what's comfortable lasts longer.","I want to continuously instigate, whatever it may be.","When you have a girlfriend, there are many things that are irritating every day, every night. I'm sure it's different for everyone, but when you fight, it gets really annoying.","When I don't look cool enough or when I cannot make good music anymore, I will retire.","I stand on stage hoping to give good energy to the audience, but if I cannot give good energy anymore, I will have to leave right away.","I love listening to people talking about their love, and it always gives me great energy.","My mom is in charge of my earnings.","'Storm' was the first song I did as a member of YG. The record gave me a lot of pressure. I didn't think I was prepared at the time.","Stony Skunk, when they were with our company, had a song which I personally like called 'Red Light District.'","I think Taeyang developed this image as a dancing singer, mostly because of records like 'Only Look At Me,' and 'Where U At.' To me, personally, I think Taeyang tried to make a change on 'I Need a Girl.' It gets a little mellower.","I hope that, even when I'm simply just Kwon Ji-yong, I can be someone who still shines even without all these 'flashy' costumes on.","When I was younger, Big Bang didn't go on many variety programs, so we used to try and plan many fun events for our concert, like drama parodies, which Korean fans enjoyed.","I think the confidence that I have right now is something that was created by the fans who love me.","We believe that anything and everything is possible, regardless if it's a domestic or international project.","Musical success depends on how much you enjoy it and how much you are willing to put in. Luck must follow, too.","I earned the opportunity to stand on stage with many senior artists at YG, and naturally, I gained stage experience.","Because I love shopping, my house is overflowing with clothes. Most of them were bought by myself.","I have a very small physique, so it's a little hard to find suits that really fit me well. I have to wear sizes that are really skinny.","I have to say I really was surprised on my first world tour. It was amazing to see what we've always dreamed of, right before our eyes.","I'm the type of person who commits to the fullest to whatever I'm doing.","I want to have freedom with everything I do.","European style is classic, with its own color, and to me, it always feels chic.","I'm not sure if they do this in the States, but in Korea, until high school, on your graduation diploma there's a line that states your future goal. Kids write 'president' or 'astronaut,' or whatever. I always wrote 'singer.'","Overall, Korean pop serves as the foundation of my musical upbringing. As a result, the melodies that I create just exude that type of vibe.","When I create a song, I immediately think about what I'm going to wear when I perform that song. I think about the music video treatment and about how I'm going to look on stage when I perform the record. The connection is so obvious that it's a single package. An outfit, to me, is almost a tool to express the music.","Unfortunately, in Korea, I feel like some people are just seeing the dollar signs and sending out artists into the foreign markets who aren't fully prepared.","Don't be afraid. There is no right answer in fashion.","Stage outfits are loud, outspoken, glamorous, fancy, and very different from normal day-to-day clothing. Therefore, by its nature, it is experimental.","I often enjoy wearing loud and outspoken clothing on stage, so off it, I usually wear loose-fitting vintage shirts, jeans, or track suits I've had forever. I just add styling to those pieces.","When I wear Chanel, I feel like I'm not just wearing clothes: I'm wearing Chanel.","Every Chanel show I've been to is very conceptual. Even down to the music and smells, the whole thing is connected."],"G-Eazy":["A halfway decent haircut will go a long way!","You'd die very sad if you tried to make everyone in the world happy, you know what I mean? You can't; no one can.","If you're not out living, then you've got nothing to talk about.","I'm just doing the only thing I know how to do. There was never a plan B.","Sometimes you wake up the next morning after making a lot of bad decisions and have this nonchalant reaction like, 'These Things Happen' - what can I say?","I think the most important thing is to be yourself and be genuine and don't try to tell anybody else's story but your own. And if it comes from a genuine place, I think people can tell, and if it doesn't, I think people can tell, and I think that eventually it shows.","You have to be dope; you have to find an audience and reach that audience with your identity and your message.","I think you should always push yourself to want to grow and learn more and be inspired and develop.","Keeping in touch with the people that matter is important.","I've always been an outsider to some extent.","It's on the people to dictate what is relevant and what is moving.","I love the road. The closest thing to home, for me, is being on a tour bus, ironically.","When you're literally staring at the person right in front of you, you're connecting with them on a personal level. I even jump into the crowd sometimes and perform with them, sing into the mic with them and share the experience with them.","I used to go and cop stacks of blanks CDs and sit there and burn copies of my mixtapes and print up my own mixtape covers and post up in downtown Oakland and Telegraph in Berkeley and literally was selling my mixtapes for five bucks, hand-to-hand.","I've never fit in anywhere in my life. Ever.","The gatekeepers don't control the gates, and the powers that be aren't as powerful.","When you sample something, you're using the crutch of borrowing chords and melodies from a song that's already great, that's already stood the test of time, that's already special. When you're trying to do it all from scratch, you're writing something brand new that has to stand on its own.","I'm really attracted to girls who are passionate about music because that's what I'm obsessed with.","The Bay area made me who I am, and it only felt right to go back there.","What's weird is the Hot Boys and the whole New Orleans Cash Money thing had a really big impact on the Bay when that was popping off. I don't all the way understand it. I mean, I know that they were big everywhere and had a lot of commercial success in the mid to late '90s, but they were really, really felt in the Bay Area.","I got my start in small dive bars in New Orleans.","It's just crazy to look back at what I was wearing in high school.","What I actually do put much more weight on, in all honesty, is not being critically acclaimed - it's being respected by my OGs. When I talk to E-40 on the phone, every time I talk to him, I'm like, you know, if he tells me I'm doing good, I'm doing good.","We listen to oldies when we go on tour. Beach Boys radio was really clutch; that was definitely our favorite Pandora station.","Chance The Rapper makes some of the greatest music out, and he build his brand up organically, and the fans have reacted to it.","Time is a finite resource that you can't get back. I have the same 24 hours you have, and you get the same 24 hours as me. As you rise, so does you chance for opportunity.","Me personally, I'm real close to my mom. She raised me. It was a single-parent home situation. She did everything: cooked, worked two jobs, came home late, but she loved me to death.","Word of mouth is the most valuable form of marketing, but you can't buy it. You can only deliver it. And you have to really deliver.","I've seen what you can do in this grassroots, do-it-yourself world, and I've seen how far that can get you. To be iconic, you still need the gatekeepers to open the doors.","I'll be a Bay kid for the rest of my life. That's in my veins; that's in my bones.","Some people will like it. Some people will hate it. Some people are indifferent. And you have to live with that as an artist. You wanna be appreciated, you wanna be liked, but you know, it's just not realistic for everyone.","I've got some growing up to do.","I'm the type of person that rises to the occasion, and when work is in front of me, I do work.","Something I stand for is being brave enough to invest in creative ideas that I firmly believe in and bringing those to life.","I was slicking my hair back when I was in sixth grade.","I think when you're telling a story from inside of you that's genuine, people connect with it.","I try to find 15 minutes a day to just be alone without any distractions just for headspace to meditate and get my Zen on. I think that helps me get through the hecticness of the day on tour with the interviews, the sound check, the meet and greets, the show and the post-show meet and greets.","Touring is starting to feel more like home than home does.","I think it's natural for a creative to be sensitive. If I'm in the studio and I write something, I think it's the greatest thing in the world; it's like my baby. I just made something out of thin air that exists now in a tangible form. It's the biggest thrill in my life.","My whole career has been from scratch, so I never took it for granted that people care and support what I do.","I've always dreamt big and the dream is to keep making music.","Music isn't selling like it used to, but the one thing you can't steal or download is a live show experience or a T-shirt.","I would never consider myself a role model in the wide sense of the word.","I don't want to be a small-time, independent, successful rapper.","For whatever reason, it's easier to perform in front of a massive crowd than in front of a small one, but again, that's how we came up.","Just wearing all black comes from Johnny Cash. I'm on the road so much that if I wear all black, my clothes never get dirty. You can't tell if I've worn the same shirt twice.","Music is one of the toughest industries, so I respect everybody who has travelled any distance, come far in this music business and achieved anything because it is so hard, and there are so many people out there these days.","It's definitely been a long, long... long, long, long, long, long journey since I was selling burnt CD's out of my backpack in downtown Oakland.","I thought everybody unanimously hated this man. I don't know anyone who was like, 'Go Trump.' I was surprised.","I wanna put numbers on the board. And the thing that everybody doesn't get is that it just doesn't happen. It doesn't just fall out of the air and land on your lap; the only way to get it is to get it and put the work in.","Rapping was something I always wanted to do, so after school, my friends and I would catch the bus to my house and just sit there writing songs, every day.","My mom was a single parent.","I see myself as a hip-hop artist, but I never wanted to make music for a specifically white audience. That's not what I grew up around.","You have this ability in hip hop to be invincibly cool, and that is a part of G-Eazy.","I always thought that one day I would be somebody. I would be successful in music, and I would have fans that cared about my music. At the same time, I really feel like an ordinary guy; I have been an ordinary guy forever.","When I first decided I wanted to make beats and write songs and stuff like that, it wasn't like I sat down and the first thing I wrote was even halfway legit. It took a while to find my way through it.","I've been in love with music since I was old enough to establish my taste.","I've never been critically acclaimed. I've never been nominated for no Grammy. I've never been on no magazine cover. It's almost taboo to say I'm actually good.","It's an honor to be able to tour with somebody I grew up listening to and somebody I look up to. When you're around somebody like E-40, all you can do is watch and learn, and soak up game.","New money is something fun to celebrate if you never had it.","I played shows in front of like 25, 50 people, and it's a lot harder to do your thing in front of a crowd that's small.","There's multiple ways I express myself. Music is my first love and will always come first. But, there are other areas and industries I'm interested in that reflect different aspects of my lifestyle.","I'm not on the radio all day long. I'm not on TV.","I had a job since I was old enough to work - since I was, like, 14.","When you're around somebody like E-40, all you can do is watch and learn, and soak up game.","I hate picking out clothes.","I'm on Tumblr all the time.","I was fortunate to have teachers that were flexible with allowing me to miss more class than I was supposed to be able to, for the sake of being able to tour.","It was inspiring to see local legends like E-40 and Keak da Sneak break out with 'Tell Me When to Go.'","I think if you're constantly reinvesting into your content and giving the fans stuff, then you can continue to tour. You can continue to sell the merch and monetize the popularity of the brand.","I've gone on in front of a crowd of 10 people and 7,000 people.","I just kept telling myself that ultimately, the money that my grandparents had put away to go into my college fund, that they were investing for me to go to school and get this education, it had to be worth something.","You have an entire generation of kids who grew up with the idea that music is something that you can download for free.","I've dreamed of being on the road, traveling and touring, for as long as I've been into doing music. It's what I live for. I just wanna be Willie Nelson.","When I started making music, I was so heavy into the hyphy movement. That's something you only know so much about if you were right there living in it, submerged in the culture.","I know what it feels like to walk out in front of a sold-out crowd of a thousand people that are there for you, and how good that feels, but as an opener, you just have to train yourself to think that it's going to be harder.","I didn't grow up around all white people; I never wanted to gentrify hip-hop, I've never wanted to speak to an all-white audience.","I think, back in the day, when I was first starting to make music, all I wanted to do was to get a record deal.","I read the Steve Jobs book, and that kind of changed everything. I've been, like, an Apple geek my whole life and have always seen him as a hero. But reading the book, and learning about how he built the company, and maintaining that corporate culture and all that, I think that influenced me a lot.","My mom would always play me a lot of late-'50s, late-'60s rock.","London, from the architecture to the culture to the fashion to the accents, feels like it's a special place.","I grew up in Oakland and Berkeley, California.","'Runaround Sue' was a big record for me, as well as the music video for it.","I don't know if most people know it or not, but I produce, like, 95% of my own stuff.","In the past, my process would start with a sample of another song, and I'd chop it up and use that as the basis of the song that I was making.","In my opinion, creative control means a lot, I feel like I'm really in touch with who my fans are and what they like about my music, and I'm able to communicate directly with them.","I'm not inherently the most politically or, like, socially conscious rapper, you know? You're not just going to wake up tomorrow and be Common.","I fell in love with hip-hop at an early age as a culture, as a sound, both from the perspective of a fan and a creative outlet.","I stick with a '60s vintage aesthetic of letterman's jackets, plain T-shirts, and good jeans.","Being in a position to bring people together like we do is a beautiful thing.","I just have more Yves Saint Laurent in my closet, but it is pretty much the same - I just wear black almost 365 days of the year. I am married to it.","When I sample something, it's just me drawing from what I'm actually into. It's whatever sounds like a good track.","I wanted to make an album that plays from the top to bottom and feels together and complete. That's just something that felt important.","I grew up watching Kobe Bryant.","I think being a rock star is a little bit different than being an athlete or even a movie star.","It's one thing to turn up and jump around stage and give people a good time - that's obviously a big part of this - but I'll always get deeper than that as an artist.","I actually went to high school with Lil Uno.","I'm just making music, and I'm paying my bills.","I grew up with the Pack. When they released 'Vans,' it was a seeing-is-believing moment.","When I was 12 or 13, the hyphy movement was beginning to bubble. And you had local acts such as the Federation or E-40, Mac Dre, and Too Short that the local radio station would play all the time. You'd hear E-40 as much as you'd hear Jay Z.","You don't need mainstream media outlets, the big TV looks, or the magazine covers.","When you're from the Bay Area, there's this chip on your shoulder that you inherently come up with, because us, as a region, we've been overlooked in the grand scheme of the history of the genre and the culture.","I think my music is so personal that it lets people in. And they identify with me more because of that, you know, so it's like my story; it's who I am as a person.","Growing up in the Bay, I was still looking for a lot of East Coast hip-hop. I had an older homie put me on to a lot of stuff like Nas' 'Illmatic.'","My friends put me on to Mobb Deep when I was a little kid. I've always been a big fan.","I don't go in the studio to make music that won't matter. I go in every night to try to make a point and make the best music that I can make.","When you're making an album, it's, like, exciting every night you make something new, but you're the only one who gets to hear it.","Anything back in New Orleans is definitely nostalgic. I really played my first shows of my life and learned to perform here. I learned how to work a stage and how to connect with a crowd. It all started here.","That raw connection between the two performers is something you can't fully plan. You just go with it and get lost in that moment and feed off of each other.","Albums serve as paragraphs in an artist's autobiography.","I grew up in Oakland, California, and there was a really active scene in the Bay Area. Everyone else knew it as the 'Hyphy Movement' of Mac Dre, E-40, and The Pack.","We used to approach a small 400-person show like an arena show, as if I was a star and I was coming out on stage in front of screaming people and that I was to be larger than life.","It's our approach to treat each show like an arena show. We over-invest in production to make the stage look bigger, turning the show into an experience and not just somebody standing around with a microphone rapping.","If we're deciding about merch pieces, t-shirts or hats, they have to be well designed and cool enough for somebody to want to buy it and then wear it and walk around advertising me and my music.","As we've added players to the team, like a videographer, a drummer, or a sound guy, we're trying to keep a bus full of A players and keep a culture where everybody is comfortable enough to push each other in their areas to be great.","My music is very reminiscent of the sound I grew up on and the place where that happened. It's a combination of everything I'm inspired by.","The thing is, I've always wanted to be a star. I've always wanted to be an Elvis Presley or a Tupac - like, a huge icon.","What costs the world to you as a working kid fresh out of college costs nothing to you as a successful musician.","I've definitely grown and evolved as a person, as an artist, you know. Just in terms of my style, my taste, my influences, everything... That's a part of being an artist I think.","I feel like if you're stuck doing the same thing your whole career you've got to be doing something wrong. Unless you're getting great results from it or you're just comfortable in that spot.","If you look at any creative person's work, you can see bits and pieces of their influences. That's what an artist does.","We're really critical with the process of who we hire. But when you put great people in position, that's how you avoid any missteps.","There's only so much you can do on a physical level trying to tour or pass out mixtapes. Although that matters, I realized that you can reach more people putting your music on Soundcloud and networking with blogs to write about you. It really comes back to the music and what you release.","That's the nature of this business. Something that took ten years to make can crumble in an instant. It could be snatched away from you at any moment.","I'm aware that there are a million other people who want what I'm lucky enough to have right now.","Whenever I can squeeze it in, I'm writing and recording.","I was making all my own beats, and I really liked sampling stuff, like old '50s and '60s pop and soul and doo-wop records. I was chopping those up and putting loops and drums on them and just rapping over them.","Performing music live, there's a certain magic to it.","I love being in a room in front of an audience who cares about the music, who knows the music, and who has lived with the music. It's kind of like an experience you share. I'm on stage performing it, but they're singing the words, too.","Growing up, I heard as much E-40 and Mac Dre on the radio as I did 50 Cent. It's in our culture to support our own.","'Downtown Love.' I made that with one of my homies in New Orleans. The story is tragic, and the song is emotional. It's my favorite. I'm most proud of that; it's such a creative piece.","I think every artist's next work will reflect a new chapter in their autobiography. Each album tells a story about where they were at during a particular period and how they have evolved.","I like to have a lot of girls over and play loud music.","I remember, when I was ten, I wanted to look like Em. I had the bleached blonde hair.","Much respect to Eminem - he's the greatest.","When you use a sample in a big way, when you loop something in the way I did with 'Runaround Sue,' it's like you have your chords and your melody and the quality of the song right there before you add your own production. It's like the song is already made, in a sense.","I just hear a beat and start mumbling words. I just hear sounds and rhythms, and it just kind of comes intuitively. Formatting a song, figuring out a flow, how I respond to the beat.","Touring is a tough plane to get off the ground, and it takes a lot of hard work and a lot of investments.","You open up a lot of tours making nothing just for the fact that you need to start somewhere and get some exposure. When you start to headline your tours, all the money is in headlining, but there's no money in headlining small rooms.","Me personally, I will always be a fan at the end of the day. No matter how big this gets, I still look up to other artists and people I respect creatively.","You can tell when someone is reading the lines of a song or performing it.","Music is only special when it's coming from a genuine place - it's just energy trapped in a bottle."],"G. Edward Griffin":["Whenever a partnership is formed, there has to be a benefit to the partners; otherwise, they don't form it.","Collectivism and freedom are mortal enemies. Only one will survive.","There are few historians who would challenge the fact that the funding of World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War was accomplished by the Mandrake Mechanism through the Federal Reserve System.","The Fed has become an accomplice in the support of totalitarian regimes throughout the world.","The dangerous thing about platform introductions is that they tend to create unrealistic expectations.","What I am going to tell you is this: Although it is commonly believed that the War on Terrorism is a noble effort to defend freedom, in reality, it has little to do with terrorism and even less to do with the defense of freedom.","There is no such thing as absolute proof. There is only evidence.","The same evidence that is convincing to one person may not convince another.","An overview of all wars since the establishment of the Bank of England in 1694 suggests that most of them would have been greatly reduced in severity, or perhaps not even fought at all, without fiat money.","It is the ability of governments to acquire money without direct taxation that makes modern warfare possible, and a central bank has become the preferred method of accomplishing that.","EO 11110 did not order the printing of Silver Certificates. It ordered the amendment of a previous executive order so that the United States Code would authorize or 'empower' the Secretary of the Treasury to issue Silver Certificates if the occasion should arise.","If you look at a copy of EO 11110, you will find that it does not order the issuance of Silver Certificates. It orders an amendment to EO 10289... Those functions did not include the power to issue Silver Certificates.","When I did my research on this topic, I came to the startling conclusion that the Federal Reserve System does not need to be audited - it needs to be abolished.","This is very intriguing to think we should audit the Fed, but I discovered that probably if they audited the Fed, it would get a clean bill because it's undoubtedly doing exactly what it's supposed to do according to the law.","The Federal Reserve is incapable of accomplishing its stated objectives.","When the dollar was separated entirely from gold in 1971, it ceased being the official IMF world currency and finally had to compete with other currencies... From that point forward, its value increasingly became discounted.","As long as the dollar remains in high esteem as a trade currency, America can continue to spend more than it earns. But when the day arrives - as it certainly must - when the dollar tumbles and foreigners no longer want it, the free ride will be over.","If we took information only from sources with which we agreed on all issues, we would be left with merely quoting ourselves, and we would miss a great deal of truth.","Criminals gravitate into government positions like natural law.","We can see our liberties vanishing here in the United States...

We can see it, we can feel it, and we can hear it.","I am in agreement with income-tax protesters that the tax, as commonly applied, is unconstitutional, unfair, and immoral.","The Constitution acknowledges two kinds of taxes: direct and indirect... Examples of direct taxes are income and property taxes... Examples of indirect taxes are import and excise taxes.","Most tragic mistake in history occurred when the United States joined the U.N.","There is simply no limitation on the realistic power of the U.N. over us.","The existing U.N. can be found in the writings of early Communist leaders.","The general belief is that communists in the United Nations come only from the Iron Curtain countries, but this isn't so. We must remember that many of the representatives of free countries are members of the local Communist parties. If you add them all up, you will see they have an amazing degree of control.","The John Birch Society is not ultra-conservative, communist-hating, and racist as opponents paint it."],"G. Gordon Liddy":["They were afraid, never having learned what I taught myself: Defeat the fear of death and welcome the death of fear.","Why is it there are so many more horses' asses than there are horses?","I don't fear anything now.","Defeat the fear of death and you welcome the death of fear.","Take, for example, the African jungle, the home of the cheetah. On whom does the cheetah prey? The old, the sick, the wounded, the weak, the very young, but never the strong. Lesson: If you would not be prey, you had better be strong.","Obviously crime pays, or there'd be no crime.","If I can go from burglar for the government to talk show host, you can go from entertainer to congressman.","Environmentalism is a form of pagan fundamentalism. These green wackos are fanatics like al-Quaida. Just like them.","I was afraid of just about everything in this world, with the possible exception of my mother and I wasn't too sure about her.","Yes, I believe the will is very important. It's how I have succeeded in life.","Once you start a war, you have to win.","The press is like the peculiar uncle you keep in the attic - just one of those unfortunate things.","I'm virile, vigorous, and potent!","I became what I wanted to be.","You get rid of the fear of death by understanding that it is an integral fact of our existence. You do that through will and reason.","The official version of Watergate is as wrong as a Flat Earth Society pamphlet."],"G. H. Hardy":["I am interested in mathematics only as a creative art.","A mathematician, like a painter or a poet, is a maker of patterns. If his patterns are more permanent than theirs, it is because they are made with ideas.","Beauty is the first test: there is no permanent place in the world for ugly mathematics.","There is no scorn more profound, or on the whole more justifiable, than that of the men who make for the men who explain. Exposition, criticism, appreciation, is work for second-rate minds.","Archimedes will be remembered when Aeschylus is forgotten, because languages die and mathematical ideas do not.","It is not worth an intelligent man's time to be in the majority. By definition, there are already enough people to do that.","I wrote a great deal... but very little of any importance; there are not more than four of five papers which I can still remember with some satisfaction.","I was at my best at a little past forty, when I was a professor at Oxford.","Young men should prove theorems, old men should write books.","Pure mathematics is on the whole distinctly more useful than applied. For what is useful above all is technique, and mathematical technique is taught mainly through pure mathematics.","A mathematician, like a painter or poet, is a maker of patterns. If his patterns are more permanent than theirs, it is because they are made with ideas."],"G. Hannelius":["My mom is just so good with fashion! She always tells me what looks good, what doesn't look good, and she gives me great advice.","I'm really interested in vegan nail polishes, because a lot of nail polishes have a lot of toxins in them.","One of my favorite things about playing Avery Jennings on 'Dog With a Blog' is that I get to play a real teenager who deals with everyday issues.","Illegal downloading, digital cheating, and cutting and pasting other people's stuff may be easy, but that doesn't make those activities right.","With the Internet and social media being a huge part of today's culture, I think it's super important to promote staying smart online."],"G. M. Trevelyan":["A little man often cast a long shadow.","Disinterested intellectual curiosity is the life blood of real civilization.","Village cricket spread fast through the land.","Action springs not from thought, but from a readiness for responsibility.","Anger is a momentary madness, so control your passion or it will control you.","Education... has produced a vast population able to read but unable to distinguish what is worth reading.","The best job goes to the person who can get it done without passing the buck or coming back with excuses.","One half who graduate from college never read another book.","Never tell a young person that anything cannot be done. God may have been waiting centuries for someone ignorant enough of the impossible to do that very thing.","I have two doctors, my left leg and my right.","If the French noblesse had been capable of playing cricket with their peasants, their chateaux would never have been burnt.","Social history might be defined negatively as the history of a people with the politics left out."],"G. Stanley Hall":["Adolescence is a new birth, for the higher and more completely human traits are now born.","Puberty for a girl is like floating down a broadening river into an open sea.","Adolescence as the time when an individual 'recapitulates' the savage stage of the race's past.","Civilization is so hard on the body that some have called it a disease, despite the arts that keep puny bodies alive to a greater average age, and our greater protection from contagious and germ diseases.","Every theory of love, from Plato down, teaches that each individual loves in the other sex what he lacks in himself.","Being an only child is a disease in itself.","Of all work-schools, a good farm is probably the best for motor development.","The man of the future may, and even must, do things impossible in the past and acquire new motor variations not given by heredity.","Man is largely a creature of habit, and many of his activities are more or less automatic reflexes from the stimuli of his environment.","The years from about eight to twelve constitute a unique period of human life.","Muscles are in a most intimate and peculiar sense the organs of the will.","Abundance and vigor of automatic movements are desirable, and even a considerable degree of restlessness is a good sign in young children."],"G. W. Bailey":["I'm from Port Arthur, Texas! Little guy! Little character guy from one of the saddest oil-refinery towns in America. And here I was driving over to Beverly Hills, to 20th Century Fox, to be on 'M*A*S*H!'","Unless you're a big movie star, regular television work is going to bring you more exposure than anything. Everybody has a television; not everybody goes to the movies.","Do I enjoy features? Yeah, I really do. Would I like to do some more features before I head to the barn? Yeah, probably. But I also love television. I love doing television because it's fast, and that I like a lot.","I don't belong to any country clubs. I don't have this big circle of friends. Where I make my friends is where I work."],"G. Willow Wilson":["When I am in Egypt, I am along for the ride - I am a privileged outsider, but an outsider nonetheless.","'Butterfly Mosque' came out of the emails I wrote to family and friends back home after moving to Egypt.","It seems like whenever you write about Muslims, people assume that you're writing about the Quran, you are writing about the Prophet Muhammad. There's no sense that Muslims are capable of individualism, that they're capable of making mistakes that are somehow not connected to Islam.","To me, a staircase looks like a series of dark and light horizontal stripes, which is exactly how you'd draw a staircase. So I know how the image is going to look on the page.","There's a burden of representation that comes into play when there aren't enough representatives of a certain group in popular culture.","I didn't believe in spiritual homelands, and found God as readily in a strip mall as in a mosque.","In comics, we're all weird together. I can go to a comics convention and not stand out, even though I'm the only woman in a headscarf there, because the guy next to me has a beard and a Sailor Moon costume.","A lot of my writer friends - some of whom are brilliant - work when the Muse calls them, for lack of a better description. You know, days of nothing, then this creative burst where they write for 36 hours straight fueled by caffeine and idealism.","For me, insomnia was something ordinary, and it came and went for ordinary reasons.","Real tolerance means respecting other people even when they baffle you and you have no idea why they think what they think.","I think all these pop cultural media often reflect conversations we're having in the real world at that moment in time. I think one of the big conversations we're having as a culture is we thought we'd solved sexism and racism, and we're realizing more and more that we haven't.","Some languages expand not only your ability to speak to different people but what you're able to think.","I'm not a programmer myself, but I am a very, very picky end user of technology. I like my machines to work they way they're supposed to, all the time.","Because the traditional mode of dress for Muslim women is so distinct - the headcovering, which is not there for guys - women carry a greater burden of representation than Muslim men do in non-Muslim societies.","In Arab Islamic society, it is traditionally taboo to criticize the lifestyle or personal philosophy of any practicing Muslim.","We don't want to create a literary ghetto in which black writers are only allowed to write black characters and women writers are put on 'girl books.'","I discovered I was a monotheist... That rules out polytheism. I have also had a problem with authority, which rules out any religion with a priesthood or leader who claims to be God's representative on Earth.","It's patently impossible for a Muslim character to represent 'all Muslims.'","I keep setting the bar higher for myself in terms of what I'm trying to accomplish.","I do hope the success of 'Ms. Marvel' will open doors for other characters and other creators.","Despite all the criticisms that have been leveled at the comics community, both in terms of fans and creators, I have always felt more comfortable and accepted in the comics community than I have in any other medium of publishing that I've had the pleasure of working in.","I write about real life as it is lived by the young American Muslim women that I've had the pleasure of meeting throughout the course of my travels as a writer and being able to speak in different places and meet different people at signings and things.","Being a Muslim in America, I've noticed that there's a ton of crossover between the Muslim community and geekdom.","When I need guidance or just to kvetch or to bounce ideas off of people, I go to Gail Simone, who is very much kind of the den mother of all of us who are working comics.","I was born in New Jersey and lived there until I was about 10, so Jersey is in my roots.","Superheroes don't often get their powers in one fell swoop. It's like superhero puberty.","When you write for a comic series, many superheroes have 60 or some years of history that you are coming into.","As a writer and a mom, I wish I could split into two or three different people so I could be with my kids all day, write all day, and go out and do the interviews all day. Multiplicity woman!","People love to talk about new and different. They don't always love to buy and read new and different.","I think people, especially in the Muslim community, are rightly cautious any time you hear, 'Oh, there's going to be a Muslim character.'","That's something the head scarf, in a symbolic way, is meant to do in Arabic culture: it defines your relationship to your husband and the men of your family differently than your relationship to the average guy on the street you've never met.","The great thing about Cairo is the vast majority of women wear some kind of head scarf, but they are also very fashion-conscious. They love bright colors.","I think any time you have a super team, whether it's all men or all women or both, what you have are people with very unique strengths that aren't always totally compatible.","I think that's a huge theme in superhero books across the board: When you have this massive power, how do you use it responsibly? When do you intervene? Those are the big questions.","I have younger friends who are in this pinch where they feel they've been counted out before they've had a chance to prove themselves. They've inherited a lot of debt - not just student debt but environmental debt, political debt. They really feel squeezed.","I think comics are really part of The Zeitgeist. They reflect back to us the issues that we're concerned about in the time they are written.","So many people are of mixed heritage; everyone is from somewhere else.","Sometimes, by using the most over-the-top, ridiculous plot device you can imagine, you get some interesting little conflicts and cool things that you might not otherwise have a chance to explore.","In many countries in the Middle East - and this is changing in the wake of the Arab Spring - but for a long time, censorship of books and film was a very big deal. There were books you couldn't buy; things with political content would be censored, but there were some genres of books and film that the censors just didn't understand.","I'm writing in English; I'm writing for a Western audience, but the people I'm surrounded by in my daily life are mostly non-white.","Americans look at the Middle East as a source of trauma because of 9/11. At the same time, I could see the fear going on in the Middle East as well - which would be the next country to be invaded or sanctioned? Being around those tensions was traumatic for me.","When we read fiction, we want to get outside of ourselves and are able to see from a perspective we haven't seen through before. That can be very powerful.","The 'Ms. Marvel' mantle has passed to 'Kamala Khan,' a high school student from Jersey City who struggles to reconcile being an American teenager with the conservative customs of her Pakistani Muslim family.","I think every Muslim woman has to feel the world out for herself.","If you love things or ideas or people that contradict each other, you have to be prepared to fight for every square inch of intellectual real estate you occupy.","In the West, anything that must be hidden is suspect; availability and honesty are interlinked. This clashes irreconcilably with Islam, where the things that are most precious, most perfect and most holy are always hidden: the Kaaba, the faces of prophets and angels, a woman's body, Heaven.","I don't know that Islam has ever been a subject of anything that I've written. I think Muslims have often been, but those are two very different things.","I think lot of Muslims have gotten fatigued by the way Muslim characters, even 'positive' ones, are portrayed in the media.","The first comic I ever read was an 'X-Men' themed anti-smoking PSA they gave out in health class when I was about 10.","Anytime you're writing stories about a group of people with whom you have limited experience, there's a lot of guesswork.","What we wanted to do was tell a story that felt relatable to anyone who's been a teenager. We haven't all been a second-generation Pakistani-American girl with superpowers, but we've all been 16 and awkward.","I've wanted to write comics ever since I figured out it was a job.","'Lost' makes a lot of sense to me, philosophically.","To me, writing an ongoing series feels like driving a freight train downhill. All you can do is steer and pray.","The more you put out there, the more you have to resolve. 'Air' is the most literary comic I've written so far, and that poses problems.","My synesthesia is mostly gone - it was a much bigger factor when I was a kid. But having no depth perception is a bonus when you're trying to lay out flat images and describe them to an artist - flat is all I see.","'Air' is very placeless - it's set in many different countries, and much of the story is about going places rather than being places. 'Air' is about travelers, and I'm a chronic traveler.","It took me a long time to square with the fact that none of my experiences are typical - I'm not a typical American, but I'm also not a typical Muslim.","The script for what would eventually become my first graphic novel, 'Cairo,' sort of came to me in kind of a bolt of lightning within 24 hours of having moved to that city. Just a jumble of characters and narratives and interesting things that I was seeing and experiencing for the first time.","In prose, you have a lot more room for digression, for very meaty kinds of dialogues. In graphic novels, you're writing haiku-length dialogue. Your job is to be efficient, to get out of the way of the art.","I don't want to compare myself to somebody like Fitzgerald or Hemingway, but I feel like, for some writers, going to a certain city, a certain place, is what kickstarts your imaginative process.","I tend to deal with characters who are sort of at that same point of wrestling with, 'Who am I going to be as an adult? What do I believe? How am I defining myself in the context of my culture and my peer groups, my family?'","For most inhabitants of the Arab world, the prevailing cultural attitude toward women - fed and encouraged by Wahhabi doctrine, which is based on Bedouin social norms rather than Islamic jurisprudence - often trumps the rights accorded to women by Islam.","'Lost' seems to be the inverse of 'Air': It explores dispossession and identity by forcing a bunch of people into one invented landscape instead of using many invented landscapes to keep people apart.","'Air' is what the world looks like: An inconvenient mashup of human politics and divine geography. We leave bits and pieces of ourselves and our history in every place we encounter.","Leaving your country at a tender age really rearranges the way you perceive the world. So I feel marginally attached to many places rather than deeply attached to any one place.","The 'Islam vs. the West' dialogue ceased to be about real people a long time ago.","There is a certain danger in thinking about diversity in its own little box, as something that is somehow separate from 'normal' comic books and comics creators.","Ninety percent of the comic books I've written in the past had little or nothing to do with Islam.","In 2003, as a 21-year-old convert to Islam, I moved from Colorado to Cairo to see what life was like in a Muslim country.","We think of divinity as something infinitely big, but it is also infinitely small - the condensation of your breath on your palms, the ridges in your fingertips, the warm space between your shoulder and the shoulder next to you.","The road to democracy is rarely smooth, but for Egyptian women, it has been exceptionally bumpy.","The transition between life in red-state America and life in the Arab capital was at times overwhelming because of the traditional segregation of men and women in many public and private settings.","The Qur'an is in many ways far less concrete than the Bible, relying on the esoteric more often than the apparent.","An ambitious, surreal tale of the love between a young Arab girl sold into marriage and the orphan boy she adopts, 'Habibi' spans multiple eras of conflict and change, stretching the lifetimes of its two protagonists over many centuries.","The Qur'an is God's property, not mine.","'Habibi' is a complex and unapologetic work of fantasy - no idle undertaking for readers of any faith or no faith at all, but one well worth the trouble.","Most people know Muslims in their community but don't realize it.","In all likelihood, you've been treated by a Muslim doctor or served by a Muslim waiter or worked beside a Muslim computer programmer. Even if you think, 'I don't know any Muslims,' it's probably not true.","Muslims are ordinary members of the working public, just like you.","I don't think being a writer who is religious means you have to write about nothing but religion. When I do write about religion, it's to inform the story, not to push a certain agenda.","I don't think there's something inherently irreligious about comics.","There are very religious people who write comics and who love comics.","Thematically, in a lot of what I write, there's a sense of displacement, of being rooted in multiple places, and how that can tug at your identities and your wants and your goals.","My faith did not require beauty or belonging - the deeper I went into my practice, the less it required at all.","Islam is antiauthoritarian, sex-positive monotheism.","Comic book readers tend to be pretty secular and anti-authoritarian; nothing is above satire in their eyes.","It's very difficult to balance different audiences and talk to each one without selling the others short. There is no universal literature - or, if there is, I don't know how to write it.","My career is a black comedy of sorts. I spent a lot of time explaining myself to various different groups. But more and more, I'm finding that the desire to communicate, which all these audiences share, is a powerful thing.","The story of a passionate woman in a stale marriage is as old as Helen of Troy.","Out-marriage is an issue religious groups have been wrestling with for some time. Of course men and women fall in love. Of course it's not always convenient to their respective cultural and spiritual norms.","Choosing a spouse with religion in mind is not always a mistake, especially if your heritage and your faith are important parts of who you are. The trick is, as always, to recognize a good thing when you see it - and never mistake the bad for something more."],"GG Allin":["My demons, inner strengths and physical battles have guided me through life.","Everything I own can fit in two suitcases and a foot locker.","I don't wanna get old and stagnant and hang around.","I've sold my records outta shopping carts on the street.","My principal once told me that I was a penny waiting for change. But I suspect that I irritated him probably because I was making more money than he was.","Death is a very important part of life.","My demons and I are not compatible. We never have been and never will be.","I don't want people to think I'm a hypocrite.","I don't have any influences, any heroes, it's just me.","I've had women who move to the towns I'm living in, just pack up and move there, never even met 'em before, 'cause they heard I lived there.","I hate everybody.","I don't want people to think that I can't make fun of myself.","I don't think there will ever be a GG box set.","You are what you are.","That audience is there for me.","Rock'n'roll has to be destroyed and rebuilt in my name if it's ever gonna accomplish anything.","No one comes to my shows so they'll feel safe and comfortable.","I believe I am the highest power, absolutely.","I am in control at all times.","I'd like to see anyone do what I do for one week.","I believe you can make forces of good and evil work for you, to get what you want."],"GRiZ":["My vision is a blend of the old school and the new school, but with zero rules.","I wanna take a step forward, and I also wanna make sure that step forward is the step that I want and that I'm not being pressured by life. You try and get better at doing something, and a lot of the time, it's because somebody told you that you needed to be better.","I have always been very interested in thinking deeply about things. I do this a lot.","I also think something that makes the whole live performance fun for me is that I love my music.","There is so much energy when you work with other people. I'm working with friends and having a blast.","There are always safe spaces. You can be a beacon for other people who are struggling. It's hard to put your heart out there and put it in other peoples' hands. But the receiving end is gentle.","I think it would be super, hella cool to hop into a cab & hear my song on the radio - like, 'Yeah!' - and also be like, 'Who is this Griz guy? He's horrible.' That'd be really cool.","Piano was my first instrument, but it wasn't the instrument that I showed the most proficiency on.","I never really had the chance to play the kind of music I wanted to play. It was always just classical. It had its limits. I play piano now and again in the new forms of music that I actually want to play, but at the time, it was something that I just kind of moved past.","Being in the high-school band was some of the funnest years of my life.","My roots in electronic music go from weird glitch music to now what's seen as pop music. Electronic music is pop music now.","I just really liked those trumpets and horns - Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie - and I honed in on that. I always looked for those big horn lines.","Everyone wants to grow, but I'm not trying to reinvent myself anytime soon.","I haven't written my favorite song yet, and I hope I never do.","I don't need more money. I don't need that to be happy.","I feel like music is sort of therapy for myself.","I loved playing the saxophone.","Always focus on the music first. That's the big thing. Staying true to making good music and not sacrificing that for anything.","My parents took a fairly liberal approach at raising me, always encouraging me to be creative and free-thinking.","My brother has been, and will always be, my closest friend.","There was so much pressure to fit in, I tried to force myself to be like everyone else. The last thing any teen wants is to be 'uncool.'","I was surprised how supportive my family and friends were in my coming out, and it gave and still gives me hope.","The environment of San Francisco has so much history to it that I really appreciate. Musically, socially, and culturally. There's this new culture of people; it's a crazy place to be.","There's no such thing as a bad Miyazaki film.","I have a top 10 list of my favorite movies of all time, and just for the sake of not having my top 5 be entirely Miyazaki films, I had to pick one. So, right now, my favorite Miyazaki film is probably 'Princess Mononoke.'","When I was a kid, I was a really bad collaborator. I was pretty introverted.","You need to be able to communicate your feelings. We need to be able to do that to feel empowered.","It is totally cool to be gay.","My one experience with Lollapalooza was in 2009 - it was actually the first music festival I've ever been to.","Zelda is the best solo game; Mario Cart is the best group game.","We just love Denver. The love and support from people here is amazing.","Stay in school and band, kids! It had its nerdy moments, and I always felt like I wanted to do something more with it.","When you first start photographing a show or being into photography, you might think it's cool to see people with their phones, like, 'It's so novel; everyone cares about this moment so much,' but then it becomes... trite, y'know, and shallow. I think the best moments of my life have been spent without phones.","Most of the people that work for me are my friends, and I'd like to keep it that way.","I love what I do, and I do it 24/7, and it hurts my relationships very often, but it's worth it.","I was a huge fan of '90s hip-hop, and a lot of what they got their music from was funk and soul records. They just, like, take a clip of that and rap over it because, you know, that was just kind of what was up.","The most important thing, to me is the intention of where things come from, like, why did you use it? What were the intentions of what you did? And if the intention is good, the intention is pure, then everything will turn out good.","I love hip-hop, and I like the beats the most.","I think we're finally in a culture now where being gay is normalized.","Fear comes from personal self-acceptance and not the self.","I love looking out at a sea of people. It's mind-blowing. But I also like playing clubs.","My life is my music, so how can I stop? I put 100 percent into my career. I keep this flow going, and that's important.","It's all about the music. Everything else is just extra.","My whole thing, to keep myself interested - and, you know, I'm a huge hip-hop head - I have tons and tons of a cappellas. So I do these live remix mash-ups with my tracks and just throw them in there.","I like mixing things up. That makes it more interesting. I love mixing in slower funk with what I do. I'll add drum and bass and put my foot to the gas pedal and press it to the floor.","I love playing live and creating these records that people are so into.","No matter what happens with EDM, I would like to go to New Orleans and just play with one of those small funk bands in an intimate venue. How cool would it be to work with a band with those huge horn lines and produce all of that great funk that makes you just want to party?","If you make music with business in your head, it'll show. I make it from the heart. There's a difference.","In this day and age, I really just don't want to sell people on something. I don't want to have to sell you sound. I don't like selling emotions. Or ideas. I just want to give you these ideas and inspire people.","Computers are really patient. They can sit there all day. It's a totally different situation dealing with humans. They can be tired or overly excited.","For 'The Anthem,' a lot of my fans were like 'Oh, man, he's getting lazy making just, like, a pop format tune that everyone's doing these days.' But on this album, I wanted to write songs with vocals that would get stuck in my head, not just movements of instrumentals.","'Say It Loud' came from many, many small battles. From, 'I hate myself, and I hate this,' to, 'I love this, and it's my favorite thing...' to, 'This is the best thing in existence.'","I'm obsessed with the sound of today, but I was raised on the Motown sound."],"Gabby Douglas":["You just have to be yourself and go full with confidence and be courageous.","Gold medals are made out of sweat, blood and tears and effort in the gym every day.","It's very tough for me to focus. I'm like: 'Look, something shiny! No, focus. Oh, there goes a butterfly!'","I give all the glory to God. It's kind of a win-win situation. The glory goes up to Him and the blessings fall down on me.","I had to face a lot coming through this journey, a lot of sacrifices, difficulties, challenges, and injuries.","My mom says I'm a fighter, a fierce competitor, and I think I am, too.","You've got to be confident when you're competing. You've got to be a beast.","Gold medals are made out of your sweat, blood and tears, and effort in the gym every day, and sacrificing a lot.","I kind of do think of myself as a superhero and just flying high, and doing these crazy flips.","Always be courageous and strong, and don't fear.","I like squirrels. They're so adventurous.","I wake up at about 9 a.m., and have a few hours of school or time to relax. Then, I have practice at 2:30 p.m. with my team.","The one snack I really love is YoCrunch yogurt. It's like an apple pie in a cup! You have your apples on the bottom, your yogurt in the middle, and piecrust crumbs on top.","I learned from my mom to always keep pushing yourself.","My family and I had to overcome a lot to get where we are today.","I used to have this lucky rock and I used to always have to rub it three times before I competed.","I accomplished something big and that's a memory I will never forget.","Gospel music always relaxes me and calms my nerves.","You know, God has a plan for me, and I'm going to follow in his footsteps and just rejoice and be happy.","The hard work definitely paid off and hard work always does.","By now, you've probably caught on to something: my mother is always standing by with just the right Scripture or inspirational saying to get me through any tough situation.","It's definitely important to have your mom and family there to back you up and cheering from the stands. You'd love them to come to every big dance and every big game, but sometimes that's not possible.","You need your mom and dad to protect you. It means they love you so much.","It's just incredible how people come up to me and say, 'Gabby, you inspire me to do anything I can set my mind to.' It's truly an honor.","I've been on a tweeting mission.","I wanted to tell my story and where I came from and my background, because it was not easy.","My mom used to tell me when I was little, 'When it rains, it's God's manifestation - a big day's waiting to happen.'","Me and my dad are kind of distant since my mom and him separated.","I take my Bible with me, sometimes two of them, when I travel.","I love listening to Lil' Wayne, Drake, and Eminem to get me fired up!","I wear makeup pretty much every day. For training, I usually do a lighter base, a lighter blush and I used the mascara and a little bit of the lip gloss.","I got my feet wet in a couple of shows. I did a cameo on my favorite show, 'The Vampire Diaries.' And I guest starred on a show called 'Kickin' It' on Disney.","I want to do all roles. The sky's the limit.","We can choose a path that leads us into trouble. It all comes down to our decisions at the end of the day.","I'm not gonna lie, I love Usain Bolt and Serena Williams. What I love about Serena is that she just gets on the floor and she dominates. She handles her business very well, I respect that.","I would love to be a role model.","I think I would go for a Michael Phelps kind of guy.","I googled 'Gabby Douglas,' and all these things popped up like 'Gabby Douglas makes history!' And 'She's the champion!'","I just want to continue with gymnastics because I'm still young and fresh. I think can get some more titles under my belt.","I've learned how to stay humble. I don't want to get in over my head because when you do that it takes you off your game.","Toward the end of the Olympics, you get physically tired and drained. And no matter how much rest you have, your body is tired.","Oprah has definitely caught my eye. My mom and I used to watch her shows. We just love her.","Even before I competed in the Olympics, I always wanted to write a book.","I love all the attention, people noticing me. 'There's the gymnast. There she is!'","I think I was about 14 when I did my first makeup. I was like, 'Wow, I really like this what do you call it? Makeup thing?'","Everyone has hiccups in their families."],"Gabe Kaplan":["When I first came to do shows in Vegas, I followed the usual entertainer's syndrome - I played craps and lost.","In show business, you had levels. I was at the top of the TV end of it.","I could've always worked shows, clubs, Las Vegas and Atlantic City, but I was successful in business ventures, and things weren't happening in show business, so I said, 'Let me see what I can do.'","Maybe I just wasn't a show-biz type. I didn't miss performing at all.","I think people will believe anything about someone they haven't seen for a while.","I mean, I would have loved to have kept on being a big television star. If that's the way things would have broke, I would have loved to have done that. I just didn't really want to continue and be someone who took whatever was offered.","Maybe 10 times a year I'll do a corporate date, but no casinos or no nightclubs or no comedy clubs."],"Gabe Newell":["I'm a handsome man with a charming personality.","Most people who end up being successful have good grades, but it's orthogonal - there's no extra information than if they put together a website and have bunch of fans who love coming and seeing what they're doing.","The easiest way to stop piracy is not by putting antipiracy technology to work. It's by giving those people a service that's better than what they're receiving from the pirates.","When I worked at Microsoft, I got to go and visit a bunch of different companies. Probably a hundred different companies a year. You'd see all the different ways they'd work. The guys who did Ventura Publisher one day, and then United Airlines the next. You'd see the 12 guys in Texas doing Doom, and then you'd go see Aetna life insurance.","It used to be that you needed a $500-million-a-year company in order to reach a worldwide audience of consumers. Now, all you need is a Steam account. That changes a whole bunch of stuff. It's kind of a boring 'gee, information processing changes a stuff' story, but it's going to have an impact on every single company.","One of the things that's important about family is the narrative history they create for themselves.","The PC is successful because we're all benefiting from the competition with each other. If Twitter comes along, our games benefit. If Nvidia makes better graphics technology, all the games are going to shine. If we come out with a better game, people are going to buy more PCs.","The Internet is changing what entertainment and sports is. It's not just a few people authoring an experience for others. It's really growing out of what everybody does.","People who are constantly looking for the opportunity to do something new are also people who are not going to be helped by having job titles - job titles create expectations of specialization and focus which don't map really well to creating the best possible experience for your customers.","In order for innovation to happen, a bunch of things that aren't happening on closed platforms need to occur. Valve wouldn't exist today without the PC, or Epic, or Zynga, or Google. They all wouldn't have existed without the openness of the platform.","I think Windows 8 is a catastrophe for everyone in the PC space. I think we'll lose some of the top-tier PC/OEMs, who will exit the market. I think margins will be destroyed for a bunch of people.","Ninety percent of games lose money; 10 percent make a lot of money. And there's a consistency around the competitive advantages you create, so if you can actually learn how to do the art, the design, and the programming, you would be consistently very profitable.","The big problem that is holding back Linux is games. People don't realize how critical games are in driving consumer purchasing behavior. We want to make it as easy as possible for the 2,500 games on Steam to run on Linux as well.","Traditional credentialing really doesn't have a lot of predictive value to if people will be successful.","We tend to think of Steam as tools for content developers and tools for producers. We're just always thinking: how do we want to make content developers' lives better and users' lives a lot better? With Big Picture Mode, we're trying to answer the question: 'How can we maximize a content developers' investment?'","If you look at the requirements for just one piece, like art, from one generation of games to the next, it will change radically. You need people who are adaptable because the thing that makes you the best in the world in one generation of games is going to be totally useless in the next.","A lot of times I make people better by getting stupid, distracting, bureaucratic stuff off their desk. That's an incredibly easy way to make a senior person more productive.","One of the things that's interesting is that the PC has always had a huge amount of scalability. It was sort of the wild dog that moved into Australia and killed all the local life because it could just adapt. There used to be these dedicated devices, like dedicated word processors.","I consider Apple to be very closed. Let's say you have a book business, and you are charging 5 to 7 percent gross margins; you can't exist in an Apple world because they want 30 percent, and they don't care that you only have 7 percent to play with.","If you look at a multi-player game, it's the people who are playing the game who are often more valuable than all of the animations and models and game logic that's associated with it.","If I buy a game on Steam and I'm running it on Windows, I can go to one of the Steam machines and already have the game. So you benefit as a developer; you benefit as a consumer in having the PC experience extended in the living room.","I think it's highly likely that we'll continue to have high-performance graphics capability in living rooms. I'm not sure we're all going to put down our game controllers and pick up touch screens - which is a reasonable view, I'm just not sure I buy into it.","Everybody understands that you're supposed to say 'our employees are our most valuable asset' to the point where, even if it's really true, they're not going to really trust you until you've earned that - same with customers.","I remember back in the early days of Microsoft that from the day that you decided that you were just going to put out an ad to a customer - and all you were usually able to tell them was that a new product was available - it was about nine months before you could actually reach the first customer.","We think touch is short-term. The mouse and keyboard were stable for 25 years, but I think touch will be stable for 10 years. Post-touch will be stable for a really long time, longer than 25 years.","As somebody who participates in the overall PC ecosystem, it's totally great when faster wireless networks and standards come out or when graphics get faster. Windows 8 was like this giant sadness. It just hurts everybody in the PC business.","About half the people at Valve have run their own companies, so they always have the option not just to take a job at another game company, but to go start their own company. The question you always have to answer is, 'How are we making these people more valuable than they would be elsewhere?'","The culture at Valve is pretty much crowdsourced. The handbook is a wiki. One of the first things we say to new hires is, 'You have to change something in the handbook.'","Growing up in the Sacramento Valley in the '70s, we were all pretty big into cars. Of course, I had to nerd out and be a fan of Bob Tullius' Group 44 Jaguars instead of Corvettes/Camaros.","A store is just a collection of content. The Steam store is this very safe, boring entertainment experience. Nobody says, 'I'm going to play the Steam store now.'","What's the right way to think about the distribution part of Steam? You need to worry about viruses and people trying to publish other people's content, but the underlying thing is to eliminate that barrier between people who create stuff and people who want to have access to it.","Photoshop should be a free-to-play game. There's not really a difference between very traditional apps and how they enhance productivity and wandering around a forest and killing bears.","To people who traditionally charge $10,000 for a 3D animating app, we say you should be free-to-play and generate a revenue stream. Think of a 3D modeling package almost like an RPG.","I have no direct knowledge of this, but I suspect that Apple will launch a living room product that redefines people's expectations really strongly, and the notion of a separate console platform will disappear concurrent with Apple's announcement."],"Gabe Paul":["There is no such thing as second place. Either you're first or you're nothing.","The great thing about baseball is there's a crisis every day."],"Gabourey Sidibe":["Your body is your temple, it's your home, and you must decorate it.","I have a nice smile, pretty lips, and big round cheeks. They help me look like a teenager.","One day I decided that I was beautiful, and so I carried out my life as if I was a beautiful girl. I wear colors that I really like, I wear makeup that makes me feel pretty, and it really helps. It doesn't have anything to do with how the world perceives you. What matters is what you see.","I love the way I look. I'm fine with it. And if my body changes, I'll be fine with that.","I think people look at me and don't expect much. Even though, I expect a whole lot.","I'm just a girl from Harlem who ended up in the right place at the right time.","I'm really, really interested in the job of acting. I can really care less about being famous. I'm more about the work, and 'The Big C' was amazing, so I wanted to be a part of it.","I learned to love myself, because I sleep with myself every night and I wake up with myself every morning, and if I don't like myself, there's no reason to even live the life.","I don't fixate on other people's opinions of my body.","I certainly used to wish that I was skinny, lighter-skinned, with long, pretty hair. But only because I used to get made fun of for being the absolute opposite. I didn't see all of that stuff as the American Dream. I just wanted to look normal. Now that I'm older, I really do feel like I am a beautiful girl.","My Plan A was to be a psychologist. I thought I would be a receptionist. I'm always middle of the road and very normal. I've always wanted a normal life, and this is what I got.","Being an actress wasn't a plan at all, so what's happened to me is very strange. Life isn't very normal, even though I'm still very much a normal girl. I ride the subway, I ride the bus, and all of that.","I'm not a big fan of doing what my mother wants me to do, like any daughter.","The thing about Precious, she's so far from a Hollywood character. She's so honest and real, I definitely felt like I knew her.","I didn't want to be an actress at all, or famous even. I certainly enjoy acting now, absolutely. Time will tell whether or not I enjoy fame.","Precious, she gets hit by life so many different ways and so many times, but she doesn't yield to it. She continues to get up and she continues to struggle for a better life.","All my life, people have made fun of the way I speak. I guess because a lot of my vocabulary is made up of things that other people say. I started making fun of them and imitating them and now that's how I speak.","I used to watch 'Coming to America' every day after school. I have full-on long-running inside jokes with friends and family about different scenes in that movie alone. Also, my brother and I loved 'The Golden Child,' so, yeah: I was a huge fan of Eddie Murphy growing up.","Well, I'm certainly glad that I was nominated for an Oscar. There is certainly a respect that comes with that nod. Also, a compliment that comes with it, too. Not that I really know what I'm doing. In a lot of ways I feel like some child on set, or like a kid that snuck in the back door.","I've grown up with girls that are like Precious. I've grown up with people that are like everyone that I read about in that book. And so years later, when I was given the role, I just felt a huge responsibility to show the reality of that situation and to show that we're not making it up.","While 'Precious' isn't a real person, it's someone's story, and it's too many peoples' story.","One of my favorite - well, my favorite, favorite, absolute favorite event to go to is Alfre Woodard has a party that I call the blacktress party. It's, like, black actresses that either have been nominated for an Oscar or should have been, and it sort of is just a night where we all get in a room and we get to celebrate each other.","Hollywood, that whole industry, is a lot like a really small town. You bump into the same people all the time. I think Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon can be played with anyone and everyone in Hollywood.","Well, I was a big fan of the book and therein a huge fan of the girl Precious. And so I felt like I knew this girl. I felt like I'd grown up alongside her. I felt like she was in my family. She was my friend and she was like people I didn't want to be friends with.","When it's time to film and to actually take on the role of Precious, I felt an immense responsibility to do it justice.","It's so weird to turn on a switch and be the role model for all women, for all African-Americans. That doesn't happen that easily. It just doesn't. And so I don't act up in public and I don't do anything weird - because my sisters are watching me, not because the world is watching me.","Mo'Nique is so full of love. I've been describing her as the tree in 'Pocahontas.' She's so wise and loving. She is just everything.","I have a birthmark on the inside of my left knee that resembles an upside-down sea horse.","I can flip my tongue over. Only one in 10,000 people can. I learned that at Ripley's Believe It or Not!","I could have easily never worked again after 'Precious.' I could be back at my receptionist job and no one would be surprised, but I'm having a very crazy little career that no one thought would happen. Although that was never the plan.","One of my personal plights in this business is about playing 'The Sassy Black Girl.'"],"Gabriel Basso":["I'm an artist. So if acting doesn't work out, which I hope it does, I'm probably going to go into graphic design or something like that.","I love sports - if I'm not acting, I'm probably doing sports.","I got lost one time for a couple hours. It was pretty bad. I got lost in a creek, and I couldn't find my way back. The cops even had to come.","I had one of the most outdoorsy childhoods you could imagine. I basically lived in the woods until I was 13. My dad and I built a huge treehouse in our backyard in Chesterfield, about 30 feet in the air. And we'd vacation on an island in Michigan, where I hunted a deer that we ate.","I don't see a lot of nature in L.A. Then again, I don't see a lot when I go back to St. Louis, either.","I appreciate when people enjoy my work, but I don't like being recognized in public.","Rarely do you walk down the street doing anything that my grandparent's generation did. And half of that comes with the technology advances.","I wish I could play the World Cup; that's one of my dreams.","You're in a scene with Laura Linney or Oliver Platt or John Hickey or Alan Alda and these amazing actors and actresses, and you're like, 'Oh my God, I haven't even started; I'm nothing compared to these people!'","I think you just have to accept the fact that no one lives forever, and eventually things are going to come to an end, whether it's a TV show or life.","I work with people like Spielberg and Abrams all the time.","The majority of actor kids are really competitive. But Gabby Sidibe on 'The Big C' has been a big help to me. Her career went from zero to a hundred in about one second, so she's warned me what to expect."],"Gabriel Byrne":["It's actually pretty complex, because there's two levels of reality in the narrative. One is what really took place, and the other is Spider's poisoned version of what took place.","Presents don't really mean much to me. I don't want to sound mawkish, but - it was the realization that I have a great many people in my life who really love me, and who I really love.","Viking women were able to rule kingdoms, divorce husbands, own land; and Vikings were very progressive in terms of the rights of women.","I think that if you can convey a kind of a complexity, a mystery, a truth in stillness, that, to me, is really worth striving for, and I totally agree with Michael Fassbender in that less is more. If it's going on inside you, the camera will find it.","I don't think we're living in great times for movies, to tell you the truth.","I had one of the best days of my life. I spent the afternoon with my two kids and my ex-wife at Serendipity. Then I came to the theater, and you know, I think I did the play the best I've ever done it.","I would like to break out of this dark, brooding image, cause I'm actually not like that at all.","Where issues used to be, say, parochial or local in Ireland or England and so forth, all politics is global now because all business is global.","I don't disrespect anybody who espouses a particular religion or belief - that is their own right to do that. But I think it's terribly important to look beyond the comfort that religion gives.","Being listened to and being heard is an experience that doesn't happen terribly often. To listen compassionately or nonjudgmentally to another person - not to get too heavy about it - but I once heard somebody say that was a form of real prayer.","I would love to go back to any time in European history, especially in Irish history, to the second or third century, prior to the arrival of Christianity when Paganism flourished. I can always go back there in my imagination, of course. It doesn't cost anything, and it's a form of time travel, I suppose.","It was either Voltaire or Charlie Sheen who said, 'We are born alone. We live alone. We die alone. And anything in between that can give us the illusion that we're not, we cling to.'","A completely disrespectful photographer was asked to stop taking photographs, and then said, 'I've got what I want. What are you going to do about it?' How would you feel if somebody walked up and started taking your photograph? I don't think you'd be very happy.","And then, I suppose, there's also a cinematic reality on top of that. Because it was extremely difficult to keep tabs on, it was quite confusing acting that.","From doing A Moon for the Misbegotten, I've learned that nobody's love can save anybody else. There are people who want to die, and nothing or nobody will stop them. The only one who can save you is yourself.","I think there's a bit of the devil in everybody. There's a bit of a priest in everybody, too, but I enjoyed playing the devil more. He was more fun.","I thought to myself, there's a man who gave up his life to serve others - to touch people in that way is probably the greatest thing you can do as a human being.","The only way you can continue to make artistic films is to make an occasional one of those. They kind of keep your marketability going to the extent that people will employ you.","What is that song that Willie Nelson sang? 'Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few.' I think of that. No big deal. I've reached a stage in my life where I am content.","O'Neill presents a very complex multi-layered kind of challenge. His characters are always deeply complex and, to a great extent, inaccessible.","I'm not a very gregarious person. I can't bear attention being called to me in a public place, which is ridiculous in a business that pays you to be noticed.","Not to oversimplify it, somebody once said a good rule of thumb in interpreting a character is to find the good in the bad people that you portray and the bad in the good.","I read a lot on the subject and had many conversations, and I have come to the conclusion that the Catholic Church is a force for evil.","I never went to drama school, but I did learn a couple of things along the way.","When you're still, and some actors are really brilliant at that, you bring a kind of energy to you as opposed to sending the energy out. There are some actors, like Gary Cooper or Kevin Spacey, that are absolutely brilliant - Gene Hackman is another - at being and allowing the audience to just do the work.","We tend to think of extremes of emotions as registering, for example, you have to cry or laugh or get angry. But for the most part, we find it difficult to read each other most of the time. If you walk through the street, most people are pretty difficult to read. But they're thinking inside.","Corporations are the new dictators.","The Catholic Church is an innately conservative rock - they call themselves the 'rock of Peter' - and its resistance to change is, ironically, what has kept it constant throughout the ages.","I'm a product of my Irish culture, and I could no more lose that than I could my sense of identity.","No actor who's any good can say truthfully to themselves, 'Yeah, I'm good; I've got this sorted.'","Generally speaking, I don't think people know a great deal about the Viking culture, apart from the label that is usually attached to them, either pillagers or deviants who came and brought back loot to Norway. It was an incredibly sophisticated, complex and layered culture. They had their own laws, many of which protected women.","I think that when we look at something that's well acted and a story that's well told, it allows us to be a mirror of who we are as human beings and as a culture, and offers a glimpse of where we're headed.","The difference that a drama group or a cinema club can make to a small village or a town. It opens people up to ideas, potential about themselves that really, in a way, education often fails to. It's a way of drawing a community together.","I attended the bedside of a friend who was dying in a Dublin hospital. She lived her last hours in a public ward with a television blaring out a football match, all but drowning our final conversation."],"Gabriel E. Gomez":["I'm a firm believer in the Second Amendment and the Bill of Rights. I don't think you should infringe on the type of weapon somebody should buy or the number of rounds in a high-capacity magazine.","I had the strong sense that I really wanted to be a SEAL, and I started thinking, 'Look, I don't ever want to look back and feel I have any regrets.'","I have a very broad range of life experiences.","If I were to listen to people all the time when they say, 'Hey, this is a really high challenge, this is a high climb, the bar is pretty steep,' then I wouldn't have gone to the academy. I wouldn't have become an aircraft carrier pilot. I wouldn't have become a Navy SEAL for sure. And I probably wouldn't have applied to Harvard.","You don't want to look back and have any regrets because things are too hard.","I'm a father and I'm a husband and I care about what's happening on our streets."],"Gabriel Garcia Marquez":["Nobody deserves your tears, but whoever deserves them will not make you cry.","The interpretation of our reality through patterns not our own, serves only to make us ever more unknown, ever less free, ever more solitary.","I must try and break through the cliches about Latin America. Superpowers and other outsiders have fought over us for centuries in ways that have nothing to do with our problems. In reality we are all alone.","It is not true that people stop pursuing dreams because they grow old, they grow old because they stop pursuing dreams.","What matters in life is not what happens to you but what you remember and how you remember it.","In journalism just one fact that is false prejudices the entire work. In contrast, in fiction one single fact that is true gives legitimacy to the entire work. That's the only difference, and it lies in the commitment of the writer. A novelist can do anything he wants so long as he makes people believe in it.","Tricks you need to transform something which appears fantastic, unbelievable into something plausible, credible, those I learned from journalism. The key is to tell it straight. It is done by reporters and by country folk.","It always amuses me that the biggest praise for my work comes for the imagination, while the truth is that there's not a single line in all my work that does not have a basis in reality. The problem is that Caribbean reality resembles the wildest imagination.","Always remember that the most important thing in a good marriage is not happiness, but stability.","Injections are the best thing ever invented for feeding doctors.","If God hadn't rested on Sunday, He would have had time to finish the world.","Ultimately, literature is nothing but carpentry. With both you are working with reality, a material just as hard as wood.","A man knows when he is growing old because he begins to look like his father.","Faulkner is a writer who has had much to do with my soul, but Hemingway is the one who had the most to do with my craft - not simply for his books, but for his astounding knowledge of the aspect of craftsmanship in the science of writing.","He who awaits much can expect little.","Everything that goes into my mouth seems to make me fat, everything that comes out of my mouth embarrasses me.","I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of Him.","From the moment I wrote 'Leaf Storm' I realized I wanted to be a writer and that nobody could stop me and that the only thing left for me to do was to try to be the best writer in the world.","The most important thing Paris gave me was a perspective on Latin America. It taught me the differences between Latin America and Europe and among the Latin American countries themselves through the Latins I met there.","She discovered with great delight that one does not love one's children just because they are one's children but because of the friendship formed while raising them.","The heart's memory eliminates the bad and magnifies the good.","Necessity has the face of a dog.","An early-rising man is a good spouse but a bad husband.","The truth is that I know very few novelists who have been satisfied with the adaptation of their books for the screen.","A person doesn't die when he should but when he can.","No, not rich. I am a poor man with money, which is not the same thing.","I think that the idea that I'm writing for many more people than I ever imagined has created a certain general responsibility that is literary and political. There's even pride involved, in not wanting to fall short of what I did before.","People spend a lifetime thinking about how they would really like to live. I asked my friends and no one seems to know very clearly. To me it's very clear now. I wish my life could have been like the years when I was writing 'Love in the Time of Cholera.'","Fame is very agreeable, but the bad thing is that it goes on 24 hours a day.","Fiction was invented the day Jonas arrived home and told his wife that he was three days late because he had been swallowed by a whale.","The problem with marriage is that it ends every night after making love, and it must be rebuilt every morning before breakfast.","I don't know who said that novelists read the novels of others only to figure out how they are written. I believe it's true. We aren't satisfied with the secrets exposed on the surface of the page: we turn the book around to find the seams."],"Gabriel Heatter":["The only time some people work like a horse is when the boss rides them.","If you were happy every day of your life you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host.","More power than all the success slogans ever penned by human hand is the realization for every man that he has but one boss. That boss is the man - he - himself."],"Gabriel Iglesias":["I found that laughter was a form of acceptance, and I really enjoyed that and I just - I crave it.","You gotta live life before you can talk about it. Sometimes when things don't work out in life, they work out on stage.","You wonder why I only talk about my personal life. But that's all I've ever done.","I'm all about showing people that I'm a little messed up, I have a lot of the same problems you have. By exposing myself and putting myself out there, people can relate to me and my act won't grow stale. I mean, nobody wants to hear a comedian say, 'Life is great.'","I usually travel with a posse. I roll deep. I travel like a rapper, but without the artillery. We don't carry guns, we carry cookies.","I started riding the whole 'fluffy' train, and it's a cute word and socially a lot more acceptable than someone saying is fat or obese. If you call a girl 'fat,' yo, she'll raise hell, but if you say, 'Aw girl, look at you, you're fluffy,' there's almost a sexy appeal to it.","I don't get controversial, I don't get political and I don't tell you what to do with your life. I just go out there and tell some stories, and people can relate.","I want to get so famous that I don't have to wake up in the morning. It'll probably never happen.","Being on TV sucks. It's a lot of work. You memorize scripts and then you show up and they change everything. I'm a control freak. When I'm doing stand-up, I say what I want and then I get instant feedback.","I almost bought a DeLorean the other day just because. If I see something that I think is cool and I like it, I'll go for it.","I just know you can not be on top forever. There's always going to be the next guy, and if I'm going to go down, I'd like to know I helped the next guy take my spot. You can't prevent the inevitable, but you can join the ship.","I was not the popular kid in school.","I don't have to worry about writing jokes. I just tell stories about things that have happened to me. As long as I'm alive and I'm living and I'm experiencing different things every day, the show will always change.","I'm a big guy, but I'm really simple with the food. I'll hit the In-N-Out or just the regular buffets.","The Ford Flex is a really, really cool car. You get inside and you have so much headroom and it's really comfortable to drive and it's real techy inside. You look at the screen and it's blue and you've got all kinds of controls. Everything is digital.","I never go perform somewhere alone. I've done that since day one. I've always taken other comics with me.","I know what it's like to have a family and not have insurance and really need it. As a comic, insurance was one of those sacrifices I made early on until I could afford it.","Comedians do movies and TV so that when they tour, they sell out. That's the goal: To get popular enough so the place is packed.","As far as guys who perform onstage, I love Chris Rock. I'm kind of jaded on everyone else.","I learned early on, stay away from politics, stay away from religion and don't talk about sports. Those three right there will get you in trouble.","When you leave, you basically want to go eat, because I talk a lot about food in my act. So when you leave, you leave hungry.","I get a lot of influence from pro wrestling. People are like, 'Oh, it's fake.' But it's not about whether the guy wins or loses, it's about how he entertains you the whole time you're watching.","I'm always very happy to talk to people. I relate to people, and the guy on stage is very much the guy that's off stage. People know when it's fake.","Some comics don't like it when people talk during the set, and it does get a little bit annoying after awhile, but I basically let people dictate what jokes I'm going to do.","Comedy is my passion. I'm going to do this until I drop.","I'm a comedian who happens to be Latino. What's the difference? The difference is, my special will air on Comedy Central, not Telemundo.","In the beginning, when I was doing my shows, I was incorporating a lot of Spanish, just trying to be a Latino comic instead of just a comic. Now I try to make the show as broad as possible... I don't want to alienate people. I want to make it so everybody can follow along and everybody can relate.","I wanted to be a comedian, and this is what I'm doing. If I can keep this going, I'm happy.","Connecting with people is not hard. I love the interaction and the feedback after shows. It does take some time, but the fans appreciate it which makes it worth it.","Believe it or not, I've got a really bad metabolism. One burger and I'm done. I'm not a guy that puts away 10 burgers."],"Gabriel Lippmann":["Life is short and progress is slow.","The length of exposure (one minute in sunlight) is still too long for the portrait. It was fifteen minutes when I first began my work. Progress may continue.","When the shot is afterwards subjected to white light, colour appears because of selective reflection.","This result is due to a phenomenon of interference which occurs within the sensitive layer.","The series of photographic operations, developing, washing, final drying, takes about quarter of an hour.","The problem of direct colour photography has been facing us since the turn of the last century.","The plate at each point only sends back to the eye the simple colour imprinted. The other colours are destroyed by interference. The eye thus perceives at each point the constituent colour of the image.","Most of these pictures, taken while travelling, were developed on the mantelpiece of a hotel room, which proves that the method is easy enough to carry out.","In the case of composite colour, an infinity of systems must be obtained for maxima infinitely slight and with an infinity of interval values separating them - that is to say, the whole thickness of the sensitive layer is occupied in continuous manner by these maxima.","I got quite good results from protein plates.","During exposure, interference takes place between the incident rays and those reflected by the mirror, with the formation of interference fringes half a wavelength distant from each other."],"Gabriel Luna":["The two most important things in my life were academics and sports. I had to do my schoolwork first.","While American football is very structured and linear and static - where everyone lines up, and there's a burst, and it happens - soccer is like the cosmos. It's like constellations. It's bodies moving in space. It's a very spherical game.","I played small forward on the basketball team. I also ran the 300 hurdles.","I played soccer, recreationally, in college.","I've been playing American football since I was six years old. I was a captain of my high school team, playing strong safety.","In high school, the fastest I ever ran was like a 4.67; that's pretty fast. But then, I only weighed 168 pounds.","Austin is almost a million people, but it still feels like a relatively small town. Everybody knows each other. Or at least everyone in the filmmaking community.","We seem, as a culture, to start to adhere to these antiheroes and have grown tired of the traditional, straight-up-and-down good guy.","I've been an actor now since freshman year of college, so it's 11 or 12 years.","I'd work with soccer coordinators at Game Changing Films and have one or two combat training sessions with my stunt double, who's a wushu master.","I actually had a nickname as a player myself. When I played high school football in Texas, strong safety, they called me Choo Choo because they said I hit like a train.","My mother had me when she was 15. My father died before I was born. So my mother was a teenage widow, and she used herself as her greatest example so I wouldn't end up in her position.","Football shape is one thing, and then 'futbol' shape is a completely other thing. It's a whole other level of fitness that you have to work to maintain."],"Gabriel Macht":["I'm a straight shooter, and most of the time my ego doesn't interrupt my relationships.","I can't argue my way out of a paper bag.","I really feel that New York City is the greatest city in the world.","Well, honestly, I'm not a massive fan of courtroom dramas.","I grew up in New York till I was 5, and I remember going to see 'Annie' and some musicals as a kid, and I remember my parents being somewhat okay with us watching 'Rocky Horror Picture Show,' which, it boggles my mind that they allowed me to watch it.","If you go to pilot then you are probably going to go to series. That's my feeling about it.","I believe that shows should be shot where they take place.","Honestly, I'm not a massive fan of courtroom dramas.","For me, I think there's a lot more room in cable television to tell broader stories. NBC and the networks, they're all very mainstream, and they're a little more conservative in how they approach storytelling.","I'm a T-shirt-and-jeans-with-combat-boots guy. And if I don't have to shave, I don't.","I think if you're artistic in any way, you're probably born with it. I guess it's a talent that can be learned here and there, but I think the instinct to tell a story or to create something happens maybe in the womb.","Frank Miller is more of a visionary than any director I've ever worked with, and he achieves that vision better than anyone I've ever worked with.","I don't mind doing the green-screen stuff at all, and in fact it's a lot like black-box theater, which I did plenty of in New York.","My parents would have loved it if my brother or I had become a doctor or lawyer.","My family is full of musicians, and a couple of times a year we get together and jam at my cousin's studio. We improvise and have a great time.","My father is an actor, and I used to go on set to visit him. I saw the stories he was telling and said: 'That's what I want to do.' I was always in awe whenever I went to the movies or when I watched television."],"Gabriel Mann":["I think you kind of hope for people to gush over movies, but I think the opposite way is great sometimes, too. I'd rather have a movie that you're angry about and that you're talking about the next day, than something you forget about when the popcorn goes into the trash.","Nolan has the strangest affect on people. You know, I think there's something very sad and little boy about him, but at the same time the way he goes about everything is so awkward and obnoxious. He can never say the right thing, you know? And I think if he just didn't try so hard and calmed down, people might actually like him a bit more!","When I started in the mid-'90s, the goal was really to shoot for a film career and stay there.","But TV has changed completely. It's not until you come into people's homes that everyone says, 'You're a success now.'","My role models were always the Pacinos and the Oldmans, the guys who get dirty with their characters, and I arrived in L.A. during the big boom of 'Dawson's Creek.' I was getting cast as the boy next door, or the friend of the jock. I thought, 'Did I really have to do all that studying?'","All I had, originally, were pages of Nolan's dialogue. I think his character serves the story in a nice way. He's a Greek chorus for the goings-on in the Hamptons.","The only description for Nolan in the script was that he's a very bad dresser. I put on a red windbreaker and every other ugly, ill-fitting thing I could dig out. He was potentially written as a clean-cut nerd, but I wanted a darker spin.","My father is a college professor and that's about the extent of my college experience. I'm sort of a professional student forever. I think just as human beings we always have a student who is alive in us and is waiting to pop up and make us feel like we are 16 years-old again.","I play Father Francis in 'The Exorcist Prequel.' It's fantastic. We are shooting in Morrocco and Rome. Paul Schrader is directing; Stellan Skarsgard plays the younger Max Von Sydow character. It's just a fantastic script. It's a very eerie, very scary script. It encomposes a growing dread that I think is really appropriate for the film.","Whenever somebody hates you too much it usually means they have deeper feelings for you because nobody bothers to hate you unless they actually feel something.","Sometimes people ask me how old I am, and I have to stop and remember. I forget myself!","I'm a late bloomer. I believe 40 is the new 19.","I do like to turn a phrase, but it's all about how you turn it.","For most of my 20s, I looked like I was 12. Now that I'm pushing 40, I guess I look closer to... 15? It must be my macrobiotic diet. Oh, wait, except that I don't have one of those."],"Gabriel Marcel":["The wise man knows how to run his life so that contemplation is Possible.","It is right that we be concerned with the scientific probity of metaphysics.","Contemplation and wisdom are highest achievements and man is not totally at home with them.","The dynamic element in my philosophy, taken as a whole, can be seen as an obstinate and untiring battle against the spirit of abstraction.","The striking thing about the Precious Blood is the bond it establishes between love and suffering in our experience, a bond that has become so close that we have come to think of suffering accepted with joy as the most authentic sign of love with any depth at all.","But however measurable, there is much more life in music than mathematics or logic ever dreamed of.","Music at times is more like perfume than mathematics.","Metaphysics is a science.","But a science is exact to the extent that its method measures up to and is adequate to its object.","Contemporary thinkers would say that man is continuously transcending himself.","On a grassroots level we say that man can touch more than he can grasp."],"Gabriel Medina":["Win or lose, I always like to get back to my friends and family. They keep me grounded. When I'm home with my friends, I'm always the same Gabriel. I'm no better or worse in their eyes because of my results. It's good to be with your true friends. It always reminds me of where I'm from and who I am.","Sometimes you surf well and still don't win. It happens to everyone. You learn that one big score doesn't mean much if you don't have a backup. I guess every rookie learns that as time goes by. I took some big lessons from my losses.","That was my dream, to compete against the best surfers in the best waves. But as a kid, it all seemed so unattainable. It was this big dream, but deep down I never thought it could really happen. But my parents always believed I could do it, and they helped me get through all the stages and take all the right steps.","After God and my family, it's surf. I don't imagine me not surfing. Surf brings me smile every day."],"Gabriela Isler":["I would like to show that I have a heart, that I am a human being and I have feelings. And to be this kind of role model, not only for beauty pageants but also for life.","I love to eat cucumber sticks with yogurt. It's a great snack to have at home, especially when I'm having house guests.","I always make my favorite pancakes with milk, and I also add some fruit - like a banana or apple with some cinnamon sprinkled on top. I also sometimes put peanut butter on my pancakes!","I think the Miss Universe title not only gives me the opportunity to become a role model for Latina girls around the world, but to show that beauty isn't just about the outside.","I have a very balanced posture about the political situation in my country.","As a queen, I speak about unity and respect. I think that is the most important thing.","I always work on my abs, every single day. As Miss Universe, exercising your abdominal muscles is mandatory!","An egg white omelet with vegetables is one of my favorite breakfasts."],"Gabriela Mistral":["Many things we need can wait. The child cannot. Now is the time his bones are formed, his mind developed. To him we cannot say tomorrow, his name is today.","At this moment, by an undeserved stroke of fortune, I am the direct voice of the poets of my race and the indirect voice for the noble Spanish and Portuguese tongues."],"Gabriela Sabatini":["When I finally held the trophy, it was just how I imagined it would be.","When I got to match point in the final I was afraid I'd be a little nervous, but I just said, You have to stay focused, just think about what you have to do.","For me retiring wasn't hard once I knew that that was the decision I was going to make.","I'm having a good time. Managing my things takes a lot of time.","I didn't know what was going through my mind.","I was a very shy and introverted person, and it was hard for me to talk to people and make relationships.","I served, she came to the net, it was a passing shot.","I can't laugh, be happy, present myself at any prize and also win on the centre court.","I carried through well with my tennis. I got the respect by usage of the tennis racket.","I felt nobody would understand what was going on in my mind.","I have an office in Argentina, I go there every day, so I work.","I lost more then 6 kilograms when I ceased with the top sport. That were all muscles. They are now gone.","I never thought tennis was going to give me so much satisfaction.","I played Mary Joe Fernandez in the semifinals. She was winning the first set. Second set was very close. I started to play this aggressive game. I think I surprised them.","I think in the lifetime of a tennis player there are many times where you feel that tremendous confidence.","I travel a lot to promote the perfumes and to do the commercials.","I want children, but at the moment the liberty I have now finally, has a far too high value.","I want not, that everybody hears about. Then I can't longer be myself.","I was feeling a lot of confidence, so I wanted to take advantage of that and keep playing.","I was formerly so stuck into plans. I can now live more spontaneously. This I want not yet to give away.","I work out in a studio. Every day, regardless where I am, at least two hours. I need it. I can't cease it.","It came so soon and so fast. It's just overwhelming. Every time I think about it, I just can't believe it.","It was very hard for me to practice and enjoy my tennis, and I didn't know the why, so I worked with psychologists to try and see what was happening. They pushed me really hard.","It's a great moment for Argentinean tennis, more on the men's side. I would like to see more on the women's side. I think we have to work a little bit more on that.","It's amazing, it doesn't feel like it has been 10 years since retirement.","Now I have the bravery to do fine things.","Regarding the Hall of Fame, when they decided I was going to be one of the possible candidates, when I heard that, I was so thrilled. You're always hoping for something like that.","Tennis has had a very positive impact on my life.","That was one of those moments where I felt so confident. I played three matches in the same day.","The difficult part was to tell the world that I was finishing.","There were so much affairs of me created by the media... of course I was not always a true single. I had some relations, once also to a famous pop star.","What these guys are doing is great for Argentinean tennis. This is motivating other people."],"Gabriele D'Annunzio":["Limit to courage? There is no limit to courage."],"Gabriele Nanni":["An exorcism is tantamount to a miracle - an extraordinary intervention of God.","Everything must be carried out in extreme sobriety.","It's not that we poor men are so powerful to be able to banish the devil. It's that God gives us the power."],"Gabriella Wilde":["Being in water makes me relax instantly.","If someone put a camera in my face now, when I am in student mode, I would get embarrassed, but when I am modelling, I play characters.","I think probably honesty is the biggest quality I look for in a relationship. Being exactly who you are with the other person.","My only experience with American things is through movies.","I like to be underdressed rather than overdressed. For an event or a premiere, it's fun to dress up more - then I like to experiment.","I'm not really a fan of Valentine's Day. I think it can be romantic doing nothing on Valentine's Day. It's more romantic than being given a big bunch of flowers that everyone else is doing.","I don't agree with boarding school. It's not something that I would do with my children, but I think it's something that kind of exists in England in a traditional way, and you do form very close relationships with the girls you go to school with. But it is a strange thing to live in an environment which is solely female.","After studying art, I was a painter for a while and was asked to audition for a movie randomly. I hadn't thought of acting before that.","I have never had the ambition to be famous for nothing. You have to do something with your life.","I actually really love British and European cinema, but you have to go where the work is, and for me, it's in America.","It can be difficult to get cast as something that is off-center from you, and my biggest fear is to be typecast.","I have sisters who act, and I'd always seen it as their thing. I was never in the school plays like them - I wanted to be a painter.","For me, acting is a long-term thing. I'm not in a hurry to make it. I have no desire to explode onto the film industry. I still want to be acting when I'm 60.","It's a little strange when part of your family is in the public eye, and you're being put into a box that you're not necessarily in. That's when it starts to feel a bit odd: When you're being told who you are, but it's incorrect.","Feeling really safe as an actor is not a great thing because you're not learning or growing.","To open yourself up and open your heart, it's a scary thing in life, let alone a movie.","When you tell people you are a model, they have a very narrow view of who you are, and it's good to be able to say that it's not all that I am.","I do think that people outside the fashion industry imagine that being a model is what you might call quick, easy money, but it can be very lonely - you have to be quite tough. It's also very physically demanding.","I'd really love to be a versatile, chameleon-like actress, stretching myself a bit.","I'm a bit of a fashion magpie.","The best thing about being from Britain is that it's a melting pot of cultures, characters, and creativity. I couldn't imagine coming from anywhere else.","When you play a lead role, you're in pretty much every scene. It's incredibly tiring. You really have to disappear into the film because you have no time to do anything else. You are either awake and playing the character, or you are trying to catch up on sleep.","For me, it's a matter of balance. Living inside your head and experiencing real things - both are important."],"Gabrielle Anwar":["I am Gabrielle Anwar: mother, lover, daughter, sister, friend, and creator in the pursuit of happiness.","I've been hounded by a reputation of being difficult when really what I'm being is truthful and honest. And I think that's been a thorn in my side.","I'm not even sure I have a style! All I know for sure is I don't want to look like everyone else.","I shop at a lot of vintage stores because the prices are amazing, and I love the idea that there's a history behind the piece I'm wearing.","I have this threadbare caftan from the '60s that I got at a vintage store years ago - it's basically a muumuu. My friends are astonished that I wear it, but I love it. It's this light fabric that just moves with me.","I want to be the best version of myself - intellectually, emotionally, and physically. So I like to wear clothes that I feel comfortable in, that reflect that."],"Gabrielle Aplin":["I love the crowds at festivals because they're so chilled out.","I'm really busy, but I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything.","For a lot of pop performers, fame and celebrity is part of the job. But for singer-songwriters, no one really cares.","I love pop music. I love drum and bass, Calvin Harris, all these electronic things, but it's nice to have something organic as well.","I feel very English. I'm proud of it. I wanted there to be a thread connecting everything, the songs, clothes, artwork, even the string arrangements. It all creates a certain atmosphere.","I write songs, and I sing them. I never formulated a plan; I can't tell anyone else how to do this. But it feels right, so I just kind of enjoy it and get on with it.","I think it's nice to work and then have success.","I think it's all about the people who listen to your music, and loving playing and writing. Once you've got those two, and they're your main two priorities, then radio and TV and all the other stuff that comes with it will come. But that's not the be-all end-all.","I just write songs and hope that they do well. I'm sure there is some pressure from someone at the label, but I'd rather keep away from it.","I still listen to a lot of the classics from Bob Dylan and John Martin, but I love electronic music as well. I'm a big fan of an Australian DJ and producer called Flume, who I think is incredible. He should be more successful in the U.K.!","I still love records, and I've been fortunate that my parents bought me a record player so I didn't just have my vinyls to stare at!","I feel more comfortable in a place like Brighton - a town, with one centre, one bus station, one train station. And there are so many arty, creative people, and things are less rushed, less stressed.","I have hundreds and hundreds of people from Brazil, Chile, Columbia and Argentina, every day, buying my music and telling me about it online.","Labels fund things and have resources for you to use. But just because you sign doesn't mean you sign yourself away so they can then tell you what to do. You need to have a plan yourself before they do.","When I was releasing EPs by myself, I was generating royalties. And when I signed, I thought I'd put those royalties into other artists. And interestingly, streaming is most of the income for those artists.","I don't feel like a pop star. I like being able to live my life the same as my mates. I don't get recognised much.","When I first got signed, I bought a vintage guitar from the 1930s for £1000. I've bought a £400 SLR camera, too, which was quite extravagant.","I'm quite annoying and can't imagine what it would be like living with me 24/7.","I'm really into fashion, but I don't really spend that much on clothes. I manage to find everything I want at a good price.","I wrote poetry before I wrote songs, and T.S. Eliot was my inspiration. I love his honesty and try to bring that to my own songwriting.","I grew up listening to Nick Drake. Without him, I would not write music - and 'Pink Moon' is my favourite LP.","I am never without my lyric book. If anything inspirational happens, I have it there so nothing's forgotten.","I've grown up with a piano in the house, and that's where I started to be able to learn things by ear. Guitar kind of happened, and I was using it just for writing at first. Then, I was writing so much that I began to realise that I knew how to play, and that's when I started getting nerdy about it.","YouTube was really good for building a kind of core, loyal fanbase. I didn't want to be a YouTube artist as such. I mean, there are people who are able to release albums and live off YouTube, but I felt - and not in an arrogant way - that I could be commercial and credible if I really put my mind to it.","Before I'd even started doing music or having opportunities with my own music, I was studying production and business and stuff anyway. I knew there were so many jobs within the music industry - songwriting or session playing or working at a label - and I was really interested in how it all works.","I got my first guitar when I was 11. It was an electric, and I can remember just wanting to be Avril Lavigne! But I got annoyed with having to plug it in and play with amps and pedals and stuff. Then I got given a cheap acoustic, a Tanglewood, and I thought it was awesome because I could play it anywhere!","I met Jared Leto at Soho House in Berlin.","I'd love to write for One Direction. I think they've done incredibly well.","I wouldn't just lay my voice on anything. But I'd love to do a collaboration, like a Calvin Harris track, for example.","When I went to City of Bath College, I studied the music business.","I love the folk-rock of the Seventies and the pop of the Eighties.","My parents are music fans, even though neither of them play an instrument. I was exposed to their record collection, so I love everything from Joni Mitchell to Bruce Springsteen.","It's important to have good tunes, but words are the thing for me."],"Gabrielle Bernstein":["Own your joy so that you can be happier and bring more energy to the world. That ripple effect works on a quantum level. It brings about changes in the world.","I equate physical activity with happiness not just from the perspective of producing endorphins but also from the perspective of really moving through emotions and getting stagnant energy to move through our body.","I'm not a fanatic about my diet. I just believe the more aware you become of your spiritual being, the more you want to respect your physical being. It's a spiritual diet: You love yourself too much to eat crap!","My prayer for you, Donald Trump, would be for you to have an opportunity to experience the delight and the joy of what oneness truly is. And if you can have that in your life, if you could feel that feeling in your life, then my prayer would be that your division and your separation, your attack, would dissolve with that boundary.","I begin each day with prayer and meditation. Throughout the day, I use affirmations and positive intentions to move through blocks, and each evening, I close the day with self-reflection and an inventory of my growth throughout the day.","The practice of being on a spiritual path isn't about being the best meditator or the kindest possible person or the most enlightened. The practice is about surrendering to love as often as possible.","One of the biggest ways we don't support ourselves is by not asking for support. Asking can take courage, but the reward is immense.","I started my entrepreneurial journey right out of college. At the age of 21, I incorporated my first business: a PR firm based in New York City.","I got started on my spiritual path when I was a kid. My mom taught me how to meditate and brought me to ashrams and spiritual circles.","I believe that my work has been well-received because it is authentic. All people really want are authenticity and truth.","Fear is often our immediate response to uncertainty. There's nothing wrong with experiencing fear. They key is not to get stuck in it.","I think the root of minor problems is separation from a belief system of interconnectedness and compassion and oneness, so when we multiply that over and over again, it turns into lies and chaos and terrorism.","Happiness isn't for dabblers.","The word 'guru' is very loaded, so I would never refer to myself that way. I see myself as a teacher.","Our bodies hold so much tension and resentment and sadness, so if we don't move it out of the body, we stay stuck in those negative patterns.","I'm gluten-free, dairy-free, and I try to keep a low-sugar diet, although from time to time, I'll have a bite of cake - you know, I'm human.","Spirituality isn't a luxury. It's a must.","I think religion is a gateway for spiritual awakening.","If you try to force yourself into change, then change will never stick.","One of the most meditative times of my day is when I'm cooking.","The way we experience the world around us is a direct reflection of the world within us.","I was always very theatrical. I went to theater school in a conservatory program.","The biggest thing I've learned is that it's not about me. All of the things that I do have to be about bringing service to the world and helping people shift their perception.","With all of the media and all of the pressures of the times, we have to have a spiritual foundation in order to survive. It's truly what I believe.","My well-being and my happiness is much more important to me than how much I can achieve.","If you're wondering what I mean by 'miracle,' it's simple: a miracle is a shift in perspective from fear to love. A miracle can be the moment you choose to forgive your ex-lover and let go of decades of resentment, or the moment you recognize that losing your job was not a tragedy but an opportunity to follow your true calling.","When you choose to perceive love over fear, life begins to flow. You feel peaceful and you see love in all situations. Your hang-ups subside and your life feels guided.","Since 2005, I have been on a steadfast journey inward as a self-proclaimed Spirit Junkie. And I've never looked back.","We are always manifesting. Each thought we have creates an energy flow within and around our physical being. This energy attracts its likeness. So if you're thinking, 'I suck,' then your energy kinda, well, sucks - and you attract sucky experiences.","Each thought you have informs your energy, and your energy manifests into your experiences. Your thoughts and energy create your reality.","When your primary function is to be happy, then whatever comes to you is irrelevant. Happiness is your true manifestation.","You can write a thousand lists and make a million vision boards, but if you don't clearly feel what you want to experience, it will never truly manifest into form.","Whenever I'm asked about the greatest lesson I've learned, my response is, 'Happiness is a choice I make.'","As you look at your fears head-on, you'll begin to see how much of what you fear is just False Evidence Appearing Real. When you act on this false evidence, you create chaos in your life.","Restful sleep is a key ingredient to living a miraculous life. I'm not saying we need eight or ten hours a night to feel fully rested. In fact, sometimes less sleep can be more restorative than many hours. The key is to have real sleep... the drooling-on-the-pillow kind of sleep.","I believe I am connecting to angels and spirit guides and ancestors. All of that is falling under the category of God and the energy presence of God, and that is what I can tap into when I tune in and slow down.","The Universe is never conspiring against anyone.","You can't always change your circumstances, but you can change the way you experience them.","'A Course in Miracles' has been one of my great teachers. I still study 'The Course' daily. It's like a gift that keeps on giving."],"Gabrielle Giffords":["As gun owners, my husband and I understand that the Second Amendment is most at risk when a criminal or deranged person commits a gun crime. These acts only embolden those who oppose gun ownership. Promoting responsible gun laws protects the Second Amendment and reduces lives lost from guns.","Rehab is endlessly repetitive. And it's never easy, because once you've mastered some movement or action or word, no matter how small, you move on to the next. You never rest.","Be passionate. Be courageous. Be your best.","Gun owners and non-gun owners alike agree on expanding background checks, making gun trafficking a serious crime with stiff penalties, making it illegal for all stalkers and all domestic abusers to buy guns, and expanding mental health resources so the mentally ill find it easier to receive treatment than to buy firearms.","Many may look at me and see mostly what I have lost. I struggle to speak, my eyesight's not great, my right arm and leg are paralyzed, and I left a job I loved representing southern Arizona in Congress.","Senators say they fear the N.R.A. and the gun lobby. But I think that fear must be nothing compared to the fear the first graders in Sandy Hook Elementary School felt as their lives ended in a hail of bullets.","Expanding background checks will help create a uniform standard for all gun purchases and prevent criminals and the dangerously mentally ill from obtaining powerful weapons.","In the absence of a Congress ready to act to reduce gun violence, we will keep working to create a different Congress.","Violence is a big problem. Too many children are dying. Too many children. We must do something.","I'm fighting hard to make the world a better place, and you can, too. Get involved with your community, be a leader, set an example, be passionate, be your best.","Every time guns fall into the wrong hands and are used to intimidate, injure, or murder women, it erodes the rights of responsible gun owners everywhere.","My spirit is as strong as ever. I'm still fighting to make the world a safer place, and you can, too.","Generations of gun owners have taught their sons and daughters that it takes as much patience and skill to be a good shot as it does to be a good steward of a powerful weapon.","Some might consider me an unlikely advocate for gun rights because I sustained terrible injuries in a violent shooting. But I'm a patriot, and I believe the right to bear arms is a definitive part of our American heritage.","While my speech is getting better every day, throughout my recovery, I have been able to sing to some extent.","Speaking is physically difficult for me.","I was elected six times to represent southern Arizona, in the State Legislature and then in Congress.","People have told me that I'm courageous, but I have seen greater courage.","I had planned to spend my 40s continuing my public service and starting a family. I thought that by fighting for the people I cared about and loving those close to me, I could leave the world a better place.","Countless hours of physical therapy - and the talents of the medical community - have brought me new movement in my right arm. It's fractional progress, and it took a long time, but my arm moves when I tell it to.","Even though many couples are choosing to marry later in life, our laws haven't been updated to address dating partner abuse.","I strongly believe that crossing the aisle for the good of the American people is more important than party politics.","Dangerous people with guns are a threat to women.","Music has always been really important to me.","Music therapy was so important in the early stages of my recovery because it can help retrain different parts of your brain to form language centers in areas where they weren't before you were injured.","From Texas to New Hampshire and everywhere in between, we know that support for policies such as expanded background checks continue to be popular in both parties.","I've been working hard: lots of therapy, speech therapy, physical therapy, yoga too."],"Gabrielle Reece":["Stay calm and aggressive.","My motivation has always been health - eating healthy and taking care of myself.","You slam the bottom and either walk away or suck it up and get through it.","If you want to stay fit, surround yourself with a couple of chicks who are fired up, so that the one day you're not, you can feed off their energy.","I'm not just a model who plays volleyball, or a volleyball player who supports herself modeling. I'm a female athlete personality.","I don't have a life, I really don't. I'm as close to a nun as you can be without the little hat. I'm a golf nun.","I want to play until the end.","My three best friends get me through everything: I need cute jeans, my kids are driving me crazy, I'm throwing a party, whatever. They keep me dialed in.","Funny, how moms can tell you what to do no matter how old or big you are.","I think if I was 5-foot-3, I would have been really popular and dated a lot more in high school. I didn't develop like the pretty girl.","I think any time people behave in a way that's truly them, then they'll never fail. You get in trouble when you try to copy others.","I'm a natural. That's why I make the big bucks.","I am a babe for a living.","I didn't get into this to pick up a new hobby. I don't want to just be a golfer. I want to be the best.","I don't want to be famous famous. I'm happy on the second tier, where I have autonomy on a professional level but I can still go out to the movies without being recognized.","I guess I crave stability.","I'm very open-minded.","My body is a vehicle for the mechanics of my sport.","I always have a million things going on at once, but I try to put my energy into the most immediate need.","Even if I'm gone all day, breakfast is the one meal I always cook for my kids. I make French toast, oatmeal, or an egg burrito.","With both kids, I started working out again at 16 days postpartum, but I treated myself with kindness, doing mild workouts, because my fitness level was lower.","Taking care of yourself is so important.","It's sort of like, our bodies are designed to keep moving, and when we don't move it, we're not going to feel great.","'The HoneyLine' is my web site and TV segments that were birthed out of the stark reality that we all need a few people to help navigate this life.","If you don't know one thing about Kid Rock it's that he's loyal. His band has been together for a long time, he stands by his friends, and the guy still lives in his home state of Michigan.","I can't sing but I can understand wanting to keep a balance, trying to pursue dreams, while creating a stable environment for my children.","On a regular basis I go over in my mind some of the most troublesome things I see about how people approach eating, and the wonder mess we have made out of a very simple thing.","Eating and food are a wonderful part of our life's experience, and half of us are walking around dreading having to figure out what to put in our mouths.","We hear all around us to love ourselves, and one of the ways we can do that is to eat food that serves our body, but also for us to love the food we're eating.","Food is fuel and not a solution to anything other than giving your body nutrients. I love chocolate like the next girl, but it's not going to change my situation.","The best thing about golf is ultimately what it teaches you about yourself. And the worst thing is how freakin' nervous it can make you feel.","I think sometimes when I go to make a move on something, people try to disqualify any talent that I have or any hard work that I've done.","I never had only one job. I was either playing ball or writing or doing TV or modeling.","Usually people are questioning my athleticism more than my femininity!","I live a very normal regimented life that focuses on my training and my private life so I squeeze the insane stuff in around that.","I really don't have the time to spend much time online, I do have web tv, which I use when I need information."],"Gabrielle Roy":["One knows less about one's own destiny than about anything else on earth.","The more the heart is sated with joy, the more it becomes insatiable.","The main engagement of the writer is towards truthfulness; therefore he must keep his mind and his judgement free.","My great hope would be that Quebec would realize itself fully as a distinct part of Canada, and stay Canadian, bringing to Canada a part of its richness."],"Gabrielle Union":["There's no such thing as a healthy tan, and that's what people need to understand.","If someone lacked decency or respect, I didn't allow that person to stay in my world.","You have to develop a very thick skin.","I love romantic comedies. They're for me the easiest thing to do and the most natural to do. There's nothing natural about holding an uzi hanging out of a moving van shooting at people. That's not second nature to me, thank God.","You get so afraid of failure and so afraid of losing and so afraid of not being the best that it's not a natural drive - it's born out of fear of failure. Which helps in Hollywood.","Drama can feel like therapy whereas comedy feels like there's been a pressure and a weight lifted off of you. You come to work and you laugh all day, you go home and you feel light and there's a certain feeling when you're sitting with the audience and they leave after 90 minutes and it's just pure escapism and they're happy.","We give a lot of others significance in our lives even when they don't deserve it. It doesn't matter if they're family or if you've known them forever. If they're not good for you, they've got to go.","I'm not going to change the world overnight. It's one person at a time, and hopefully they're people in positions of power who can help people get in those roles and really, truly embrace colorblind casting.","You have to be resilient.","I think if we open ourselves to all different kinds of men and all groups, we find a lot more opportunities to love.","You come to work and you laugh all day, you go home and you feel light and there's a certain feeling when you're sitting with the audience and they leave after 90 minutes and it's just pure escapism and they're happy.","If my real life was half as exciting as what is reported, I would be thrilled.","When someone who loves and cares about me compliments me, I feel more glamorous than when the flashbulbs are going off on the red carpet.","I'm just riding this train as long as I can. As long as I'm having fun, I'll do it. When it stops being fun, I'll try something else. Maybe I'll open up a chain of Popeye's Chicken.","After Halle Berry does her films and Queen Latifah does her films, it's left to all the black, Latino and Asian actresses to fight over a couple of roles. I opted for some TV. There's just not a ton of work in film.","A lot of women seem to think the way to ingratiate themselves is to put down other women or backstab. That's the quickest way to be eliminated from my life - try that with me, and you're out.","In my career, there have been roles I haven't taken because someone involved with the project gave me a bad vibe. I don't care how much money is on the table: No job is worth feeling uneasy every day.","I can't just say one time of the year I'm going to do something different. I have to commit to a lifestyle behavioral change and just try to be a little bit better today than I was yesterday.","I don't function well in chaos, whether it be my sheets or the dishwasher.","There's an inherent idea that if a Black executive producer and a Black director are going to do a movie based on a Black writer's book that everybody is going to be Black.","I just thought acting would be something to help out with my student loans, but my first year as an actress, I made more money than my parents. That's when I realized it could turn into a career. After that, I put everything I had into it.","Hollywood needs to recognise all shades of African American beauty.","I like directors who have worked as actors. They know the experience.","I want to be Miss USA or Miss America. I would bring the trophy back to Nebraska. My interests are agriculture and corn. Hey, I'm just riding this train as long as I can. As long as I'm having fun, I'll do it. When it stops being fun, I'll try something else.","The black community in Hollywood is very small and close-knit. Everyone has a common goal: to make a two-hour movie in 30 days.","I realized I had been keeping people around even when deep down I knew they were bad for me. I had overridden myself.","As a newly married person, as much as I would love for my husband to buy into the 'my way or the highway' philosophy, you realize it's all about compromising and finding some sort of middle ground that everyone can live with.","I love horses.","I just kind of assumed that you do a movie and then you leave and you hop onto the next thing. I never thought that people are actually buddies.","You want to come home to a nice firm bed with the corners tucked in so you start over, like each night is like a new night.","But I prefer to go to comedies. Give me Julia Roberts smiling anyday.","Sometimes it's not even a role that's specifically written for a woman. It could be a role written for a white man or Asian man, or Latino. If it's something that I feel I could do well, I go after it. Especially if it's nothing that has to be gender or race specific, I'm all over it.","My friends are very opinionated about the people I date.","I've dated a number of 'mama's boys.'","In Hollywood, you play a mom, and the next thing you know, you're on 'The Golden Girls.' They age you so fast.","A couple of my friends started having babies, and I thought, 'Maybe one day, with the right guy.' I have to find the guy first.","I had to learn - since I'm divorced now and everyone is like, 'Oh my God, you're single, what's going on?' - that if I don't like to spend time with myself, how can I ask someone else to enjoy spending time with me? I'm getting to learn how to enjoy my solitude and have a good time.","I'm the kind of person whose clothes are all hung up and color-coordinated, to the point where my whites don't touch my creams.","I was at one time a football wife, and there is a certain level of bonding that happens between women who are the wives of football players.","I think I'm drawn to more villain-type characters, because it's so cool to get to say all the things you want to say. In Hollywood, you get to this position where you have to bite your tongue so much. You take all your experiences of not being able to say what you really want to say, and channel that through your character.","I like meat and carbohydrates.","I'm not sensitive, I'm not a weepy person.","I love TV. I love the stability of it.","We all have to let go of the Prince Charming complex and realize he doesn't necessarily exist in the package we assume he'll come in.","Boys are so much drama.","I date, but the person I date most is myself, unfortunately.","People think that celebs make a lot more money than we do. We look for bargains and we do a lot of stuff on our own.","I don't get enough sleep so I always have undereye bags.","I drink a gallon of water a day.","In Hollywood, you play a mom and instantly, you've got osteoporosis.","Hollywood panders to the 18-to-34 crowd. That demographic doesn't care about race and the package it comes in. They care about the hottest chick. They just like hot chicks.","Reality TV looks more like America than movies do.","My mom is painfully sweet; she's from Nebraska.","All minorities think they're immune, but we're absolutely part of the one in five that gets skin cancer! It's a myth, and myths are meant to be debunked!","I'm not the type to lay out on the beach, but I do love to work out outside, and that can really take a toll on your skin!","Just like I find men who talk sports who don't really know sports annoying, I think men might find women who don't really have a true passion and knowledge of sports maybe not so attractive.","I've always had an interest in sports across the board.","I played sports year around: basketball, soccer, softball and I ran track year around, from the time I was, like, six, seven.","I was always in the popular crowd, but I really had atrocious teeth. I was encouraged to 'do well in school, 'cause no one's going to marry you!'","I've been trying to get cast as a lesbian for years.","I think there's a lot of things that occur within the African-American community, that we would prefer to stay within the African-American community - that we get a little nervous when you start having scenes or dialogue that we know is going to be viewed and heard on a national or global scale.","Within a lot of African-American households, I think, there's an idea that black men don't want to take an active participation in the lives of their children. That if they do, there has to be some sort of ulterior motive.","Before I got married, I dated the gamut.","The guys I tended to date, you know, didn't necessarily have it altogether but I had a great time.","We don't consider black, urban films as 'indies,' though many of them are shot for under $10 million which is kind of the definition of an indie.","In Hollywood, marriages are kind of expected to fail.","Right now, I don't have the same urges as other women when they see a baby. When I see children, I see responsibilities, which I don't think I'm quite ready for. I feel the same about puppies. They're cute for a second, but there's a lot of responsibility involved.","When you want a break from dogs, and you take them to the kennel to the stars, no one thinks you're a bad pet owner. But when you have kids, you can't drop them off for three weeks without someone calling Child Protective Services!"],"Gabrielle Zevin":["I remember visiting my grandmother Adele in Ponce Inlet, Florida, when I was three years old, and she had an IBM electric typewriter. I thought that this electric typewriter was about the most fascinating toy in the world - I liked the little bell and the sounds and the feel of the keys and especially the erase key.","Before I liked to write, I liked to type. I remember visiting my grandmother Adele in Ponce Inlet, Florida, when I was three years old, and she had an IBM electric typewriter.","When I was around eight, I learned how to touch-type at school, and I received a computer as a present. I started writing plays, and for many years I thought I would be a playwright.","I don't believe in writer's block.","I wish that the adults who are 'in power' cared more about what their children read. Books are incredibly powerful when we are young - the books I read as a child have stayed with me my entire life - and yet, the people who write about books, for the most part, completely ignore children's literature.","I think you can do a lot, like describing people with their physical characteristics, things like that, but to me, I've always found it to be a much more informative question to ask somebody what they read.","Sometimes, readers, when they're young, are given, say, a book like 'Moby Dick' to read. And it is an interesting, complicated book, but it's not something that somebody who has never read a book before should be given as an example of why you'll really love to read, necessarily.","I like to believe, as a writer, that anybody who isn't a reader yet has just not found the right book.","I myself am mixed race - my mother is Korean, and my father is an American Jew - so I've always felt other.","I knew I wanted to do something creative, and you don't necessarily go to Harvard to do that. It's not the best choice for creative writing.","Writing blurbs for books means you have to read the book, and it cuts into the business of bookselling. So every time I get a blurb from a bookseller, I try to write a thank you note.","In a way, publishing in 2005 was similar to publishing in 1950. Nobody kept blogs; that was still optional. I didn't even have a website then.","I'm very privy to the way bookstores work, and I think a lot about the ecosystem that my books have been published in. I think it's great to be aware of how publishing works.","I'm like a unicorn; I'm a midlist writer who hasn't done anything else but write. But because I wasn't amazingly famous, I didn't become Stephanie Meyer, or even a huge literary name like a Jonathan Franzen or a Joshua Ferris.","People choose to read, and it takes effort. It's not one of those hobbies that asks nothing of the person who is doing it. It's more than a hobby.","I hadn't ever felt any particular calling to be a novelist, and I clearly remember telling a friend of mine about six months before I started work on 'Elsewhere' that I would never write a novel.","When I first started writing, I used to listen to music all the time because it would make time pass more quickly. And then I started to wonder if the music wasn't affecting my writing in ways that I didn't necessarily intend.","On some level, I think we want our reading self to represent our best self.","My grandparents used to bring me books every time they saw me.","For the record, I have long suspected that my favorite book is actually 'Charlotte's Web.'","I'm in the middle of a 25-city book tour, and I like watching what people buy in bookstores. I see people buy books that I strongly suspect they will never read, and as an author, I must tell you, I don't mind this one bit. We buy books aspirationally."],"Gaby Hoffmann":["I was born naked. I'm a natural. I'm a natural nude. So I've been on camera naked a lot.","I think mental illness is a slippery slope to talk about these days because people are overly diagnosed, overly prescribed, overly everything.","I don't revisit anything unless there's a really good occasion, like BAM screened 'This Is My Life', with Lena Dunham and Nora Ephron before she died. It also screened 'Uncle Buck', so I took my niece. I don't have a TV, so I don't happen upon old movies like you would if you had cable.","I don't watch a lot of T.V. I only watch things via Netflix, so I only watch the things that I'm choosing to watch.","I wanted to live in the suburbs and have a white picket fence and my own bedroom. And a staircase - I thought having a staircase meant that you were a normal family. I thought somehow if you could transplant us to the suburbs, we would become a normal family. But in retrospect, I'm so grateful I grew up in the Chelsea.","All my cousins steal things. They're just a bunch of thieves. My whole family is like that. You put something down for a second, and they steal it. You never see it again.","If somebody smiles at me on the street, I'm like, 'Hi, have a nice day!'","People are obsessed with actresses being hairless, fatless Barbie dolls.","It's hard to live in a blind and aimless - or dishonest, rather - narrative when somebody in your family is going farther toward - or at least think they are and say they are - their true self.","I watched a lot of television as a kid, and the suburbs to me - that was exotic! Like, a mom and dad who lived in the same house and had jobs and cooked breakfast at the same time every morning and did laundry in a washing machine and dryer? That was like, 'Woah! Who are they? How do you get to be like that?'","I don't know how people do this waxing thing. Now I just have all these bumpy ingrown hairs.","I've been very excited to have children for a long time. It definitely added an interesting twist to the night we screened 'Lyle' at Outfest, and I got up to do the Q&A, and I had this huge belly no one was expecting. It creeped everybody out in the best way.","You can do your job and be yourself and be comfortable all at the same time!","My mom was a single mother, raising my sister and me. My mom has an incredible talent for living in the world without traditional structure, and her friend, who was in advertising, put me in a commercial when I was five. It was just to make money.","I always knew when I graduated from high school, I'd go to college. I never thought about what I was walking away from... I just wanted to study literature and writing.","Going into my 20s, I was uncertain, trying to figure out what my relationship to acting is.","I'd started acting as a child. But I wanted to see if it was something my true personality was interested in. I stepped away from offers when I took five years off to go to college. I've only really just decided to whole-heartedly embrace acting.","The early part of my career was the 1990s, and I was living in New York working as an actor. It was the world I was in. A lot of companies had a great deal of money.","I curate my T.V.-watching quite carefully.","I think being on a set where people aren't being treated as equals, and with just a common level of decency and respect, is really uncomfortable.","I basically took six or seven years off, but then I had another five or four of me not working at all because I was in school. It was really 13 years of me not working at all... I really couldn't even think about it.","I don't know if I'd say I feel green, but I'm getting to know myself as an actor now in a way that I never did as a kid.","Acting was something that I grew up just doing. I certainly never thought about it.","I think that every young person is a little mentally ill, you know? If we're not totally shutting down, we're all a little bit mentally ill in our twenties and maybe into our early thirties.","When people are struggling, that's a painful place to be in, to not know who you are and where you belong and what you desire.","I've been told by many people that if I had a Twitter account, I would be making five hundred thousand dollars more a year.","I was watching 'Pulp Fiction' when we were making 'Now and Then'. I didn't care about 'Now and Then,' you know?","There are really very few roles for women in films in which you can also make a living.","There's plenty of great independent films to do, but you can't support yourself making independent film as an actress.","I was never that famous, but I do think going to college and really getting away from the business and taking a true break is incredibly, incredibly important if you start acting at a young age.","I don't think it should be allowed for people to start working at a young age and not take the time to just be living as themselves in the real world, especially now in this new age of new media and the obsession with celebrity. I think it's a real crime.","I went to school to study literature and writing, even though I didn't end up really doing that in the end.","I started missing acting when I was in school, and I realized after being in the business after however many years that I was really interested in film.","I have a teacher friend who gets nervous when there's $200 in her account. But at least she knows that in a week, she'll get another paycheck. I have no idea.","It's funny because I grew up with the T.V. on 24 hours a day. And the more money I made, the more T.V.s we had.","I had a world of people raising me; it was like a little village.","I think I happened to work with sort of a bunch of slightly difficult male directors when I was a kid. I've since worked with lots of male directors that I love, so I no longer see the distinction gender-wise.","I am paid to dive deeper into my own humanity and do that with other people in collaboration... so that, in and of itself, I just feel like is the greatest privilege in the world.","I grew up with artists and drag queens. These were just my neighbors and friends and the people who are raising me.","I never set out to be an actor. Again, my mother presented this job by job to me at the time, and if it sounded fun, I would say yes and if it didn't, I would say no. I always knew, since I was 7 or 8 years old, that it was a means to an end and that I wanted to go to college.","I'm normally the least busy person I know.","The sleeplessness is proven; it eradicates your memory.","As an actress, vanity is your enemy. If you're thinking about how you look, you're not going to give a good performance. Once I realized, 'Hmm, I guess I'm not that vain,' it's like something I wanted to protect. I can't imagine anyone could give the full dynamic performance they're capable of and still be vain.","I didn't intend to introduce food so early, but she became very interested at about 5 months, and I just gave her whatever sort of nutrient-rich food I had. Her first food was smoked trout.","I was obsessed with the idea of going to college. And I took many years off after that, so I sort of missed the weird, crazy transition that was what making movies was in the nineties to what's happening now.","I just want my kids to have the space of childhood to explore themselves as fully as possible.","People ask me all the time, 'What is it like being on set for a show about trans people?' And this is a state of normalcy to me.","I certainly don't have any boundaries myself, but I think I'm very aware of other people's.","I'm not one of those New Yorkers who so much identifies themselves with the city that they can't imagine living anywhere else. I plan to live a lot of other places, but it is defiantly is a big part of who I am. I have a complicated relationship with it. It has changed so much, but I love it, and it's my home. I'm really glad I grew up there.","I just had fun making the movies - just being on set - but I didn't really care about the acting part.","I'm somebody who's super into psychology and analysis and the human psyche and the human experience.","I really, really loved making 'This Is My Life' and 'Now and Then.'","I've never been on a television show as a regular before.","I think sexuality is fluid, and we have such a strange relationship to it in this country. It's been so fixed and so controlled for so long.","I often use the word 'magical' to talk about what it feels like on set.","Every scene is on the table to collaborate on, to pick apart, to try a million different ways. Usually, what ends up occurring in the end is something that no single person knew would happen or had planned for.","I'm interested in people. I'm curious about people, and of course we're curious about people whose work we respond to. So I'm not saying that I don't understand fascination with other people. But as it's dealt with in this American, modern-day culture, I find it not just boring but actually sort of destructive, really.","I was anxious before I decided to go back to acting about what I wanted to do with my life. Once I realized I was sort of interested in acting, I've been pretty lucky and had all these great parts. And I feel pretty much like, 'What will happen will happen.'","People would say, 'Can I hug you?' And I would say, 'Yes, you can hug me! We're fellow New Yorkers!'","There's something extremely bizarre about the way people consume media now.","If you don't have a healthy relationship with yourself, how can you with anyone else? Even if it's not healthy, I imagine it's a lot of fun. And healthy or not, I still think there can be a lot of love.","Here in America, just as we see such incredible progress happening in one state, we see another state passing absolutely disgusting and oppressive laws against the rights of all sorts of people - transgender people, gay people, women.","I loved being on the set of 'Field of Dreams' because I hung out with the baseball players all day, played cards, flirted with Ray Liotta, and had a ball.","Every once in a while, I would say, 'I don't want to do this anymore,' and I would go back to third grade, and after six months, I'd say, 'OK, I'm bored. Let's go make a movie.'","Her mother, Laurie Simmons, is a contemporary artist, and my stepmother, Cindy Sherman, is a photographer, so they've known each other forever. Lena and I were often at the same dinner parties when we were kids.","We lived in a classless society. We'd spend a summer at Gore Vidal's house in Italy, but we were on and off welfare.","I was never as famous as all these kids. There was no social media. We weren't celebrity-obsessed as a culture. I feel like these kids are under a crazy microscope; they're basically brands. And they eventually implode and act out. They need a break, and they're not getting one.","Our parents all experimented with raising us in a fairly loose, unorthodox way. A huge emphasis was placed on creativity, and our artistic efforts were never dismissed as childish. There was a sense that we - kids and grown-ups - all had the potential to make something of value. Our drawings were not simply destined for the refrigerator.","I just wanted to rollerblade at Union Square.","It was like I lived in a little suburban neighborhood in the middle of New York City because I could run around barefoot or, you know, completely independently from a very young age in the safety of this building where I knew everybody and where I had friends on every floor, and I knew the bellmen in the lobby.","My mom could be pretty strict.","There's a lot of improv in 'Girls'.","I'm not on social media; I don't watch TV. I'm really out of it.","Anything that needs to be accessed is within me. Even if it's in a circumstance that seems outrageous, I can still just go back to the basic human experience and it's all there.","I just try to show up and be relaxed and present and honest. And that's my only trick. And sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. Honestly, sometimes it really doesn't work.","If you're working opposite an actor who can act, then all you have to do is listen and respond.","I met Jill Soloway at Sundance a couple years ago. I was there for 'Crystal Fairy', and she was there for 'Afternoon Delight'. She reached out and wanted to get together.","Playing dysfunctional characters or crazy characters is only fun if they're well written. So I have been lucky enough to be asked to play crazy people who are very well written."],"Gad Elmaleh":["Morocco is completely alive for me because I spent about a third of my life there. The first few times I went back to Casablanca, I walked through the streets and remembered how years earlier I had walked those same streets and prayed that a miracle would happen and I would leave and become famous.","I like to do comedy. It's my real passion. I want to make people laugh.","Journalists ask me, 'Why don't you ever talk about sex in your performances?' True, I don't talk about sex - not in my personal life and not in my professional life. This is modesty.","After New York, Chicago is my favorite city. It's just this great mix of Europe and America. The friends I have there are smart and witty and fun.","My name, my origins, my background and my experiences are what leveraged my success. The angle of the immigrant, through which I examined the reality in France, distinguished me.","When you succeed, at a certain point, you want to challenge yourself. Otherwise, you become boring. You become a has-been. It's not very interesting. I don't want to be this guy who has only succeeded in France. I could say, 'O.K., that's it; merci.' But I'm not interested in that.","Comedy in America is very serious. Either they laugh, or they don't.","There were two things I used to do to seduce girls: jokes and music. Since I'm not a great pianist, jokes were my thing.","I don't feel any need to play the role of the clown. In my private life I take a break from humor.","Actually, I don't like dogs. I'm from Morocco, and people there don't like animals.","I go to New York to see live shows, not movies.","My dream is not Hollywood, but to perform my act in English to 30 people in a Soho comedy club, to show New Yorkers what they look like from the French point of view.","America is where standup comedy was born. It's the standard. So you want to go and do your job where this is the mecca of what you do.","It's liberating to perform in another language. There are some subjects I would never talk about in French, where they see me as a public figure, that I talk about in English.","I did movies because I was flattered and for money and because I wanted to kiss Sophie Marceau.","Everywhere I go in America, when they learn I'm from France, the first thing they ask me is if I'm a huge Jerry Lewis fan. I've never been able to figure that out.","It's only fitting that a Jewish comic makes his Just for Laughs anglo debut in a church, right?","I love the Comedy Cellar. The audience has no expectations because they don't know me. It's great. It's only winning - if I bomb, they just say, 'Oh, the French guy sucks.' But if I do well, then they remember me.","I talk about my dad and the American dream, and I just want to say to Americans how fascinated we are by America. We would love Americans to look at the rest of the world that way sometimes.","I was in a steak house once, and someone proposed. I was so embarrassed. The woman started crying, and I thought, 'She was just proposed to in a steak house - I'd be crying, too.'","When Americans, who have no idea who I am, laugh at my jokes, it's exactly the same if someone loves you even if you're not rich and famous.","There's so many funny things to say about being with Charlotte. I've worked on a few bits about it - not to be indiscreet but because the shock of culture and values is so interesting.","That's only in America. We don't have French doors in France.","If I were bombing with my jokes in English, I would go back to France. Maybe do that mime thing.","In America, going on a date is really more like 'interview night.' You have to give your resume.","I want to talk to the audience. This is what I've been doing in my work in French forever - talking about small things becoming big problems. I notice all the details, all the tiny little things.","Eventually I was saying to myself, maybe it would be better, instead of trying to become an American comedian in France, to mix those two styles and those two genres. Because of course it's good to be efficient and sharp, and to have a joke every twenty seconds, but it can be a little cold and dry.","In France, I'm not going to say the audience will laugh for nothing, but you could compare the response I get to the response Louis CK or Chris Rock would get if they go up in a club in Denver tonight.","When they don't know you, when you don't have credits and they're thinking, 'I don't know this French guy,' your first five minutes are trying to seduce them, trying to get them on your side. And it's not easy.","It's a good time to be here in America. You feel that people just want to be together and release the pressure and laugh.","It's a time where every country and every human should be united. I mean, every country has its problems.","If you are not on TV, you don't really exist. I want to bring my comedy to the world and tell my story to a bigger audience.","Americans don't like puns and plays on words, which is totally opposite in the comedy world to France or even Italy and Germany.","I love coming to New York. I think I'm going to come really often here. I need to - for the show, for the comedy. I want to do the shows here and have a beer and hang out with the comedians.","I discovered that it's not really about the language. It's about how the words are pronounced and the delivery. We have plenty of good English-speaking comedians. It's O.K. if I have my accent, my gestures, my way of speaking.","When you succeed, at a certain point, you want to challenge yourself. Otherwise, you become boring. You become a has-been. It's not very interesting. I don't want to be this guy who has only succeeded in France."],"Gael Garcia Bernal":["Migration is as natural as breathing, as eating, as sleeping. It is part of life, part of nature. So we have to find a way of establishing a proper kind of scenario for modern migration to exist. And when I say 'we,' I mean the world. We need to find ways of making that migration not forced.","We think that democracy can change a lot of things, but we're being fooled, because democracy is not the election. We've been taught that democracy is having elections. And it isn't. Elections are the most horrendous aspect of democracy. It's the most mundane, trivial, disappointing, dirty aspect.","I go with the flow. Whatever music you play for me, I'll dance.","It is quite common to meet people that live a few kilometers away from Mexico and that have never been there. We need to revive on many levels an illustrious desire to get to know the world, to learn another language, to understand and create empathy with people that live a few kilometers away from us. It's never late to do this.","You know, Motorcycle Diaries has no incredible stories, no sudden plot twists, it doesn't play that way. It's about recognizing that instance of change and embracing it.","The world of classical music is so fascinating. It's a world that encompasses people from everywhere and erases the basic restraints of nationality; everyone is united by this common language of music.","Mexican food is far more varied than people think. It changes like dialects. I was brought up in Jalisco by the sea on a basic diet - tomatoes, chillis, peppers of every size and rice, which is a Mexican staple. The Pacific coast has a huge array of seafood.","I grew up with a lot of exiles from Chile, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Colombia - I grew up with them, and I gained a family; I gained friends.","Democracy should be practiced not every six years, but every day.","I think the best thing I can say about it - and I think the best thing you can say about anything, really - is that 'The Motorcycle Diaries' made me feel like my home was bigger; it made me feel at home anywhere in Latin America.","The concept of monogamy is an inheritance of a medieval time, when family would carry the tradition of the name and certain privileges. It's a way of organizing society, perhaps.","Music is really nothing if you think about it - it only becomes something when somebody listens to it. And then it becomes uncontrollable.","In Latin America, you don't do things for the money because there is no money.","I think the water dictates how food will taste in a country. In England the apples taste unlike apples grown in any other place. England is an island, there's a lot of salt in the air and in the water. I think that has something to do with it.","In Mexico, theater is very underground, so if you're a theater actor it's very difficult to make a living. But it's also a very beautiful pathway to knowledge and to an open education.","The collective experience of watching a great film together in a room is a transcendent moment that will never die.","In a comedy, after the day is done, you can figure out ways of how to make it even funnier for the next day. In dramas, it's very different - the mindset that you're in.","I asked the producers when I was doing 'Y Tu Mama Tambien' if they could give me a VHS recording of the film that I could show to my family, because in Mexico and Latin America, when you do a film, you don't expect anybody to see it, especially not in the cinema.","I was asked to go to Cannes to present Amores Perros. And little did I know that this film would be huge. I saw it for the first time in Cannes, and it was the first time I'd seen myself on such a big screen. And it had a huge impact on me - it was the strangest feeling.","Texas is a country in its own. It's made up of half Mexico/half United States but completed mixed. I don't mean to draw a generalization but it is a place, a territory, that's really made up of all these encounters, you know?","I want to do work, but I also want to have a good time.","A person isn't born with the intelligence to be with someone special; you learn it, and you fail in the path of life, but you don't have to give up the chance to love.","I feel optimistic about how heterogeneous societies pull together. We just have to keep on with the struggle.","I want to direct every now and then, but I don't want to be a director.","I'm addicted to avocados, and I'll put them with anything, particularly chillies. Can you imagine if they became extinct? That would be like the apocalypse, no?","There is something about the live performance of an orchestra that makes it very different to a film. With a film, you can rewrite it in a way with the material you have, and in rehearsals, you're really trying out different things. In an orchestra, you can't do that. They separate as soon as the performance factor comes into play.","There's no such thing as a specific authenticity to what Mexico is, because Mexico is incredibly complex and varied, and the food is completely different if you travel 50 kilometers. It just changes all the time.","I was little there were times I wanted my parents to be normal. I wanted them to have a religion. I wanted them to have a job, like the parents of every other kid I went to school with.","In Mexico you have death very close. That's true for all human beings because it's a part of life, but in Mexico, death can be found in many things.","Doing films in Latin America is like an act of faith. I mean, you really have to believe in what you're doing because if not, you feel like it's a waste of time because you might as well be doing something that at least pays you the rent.","Every decision that you make you have to be incredible congruent. It doesn't mean that you have to starve. If you need money, you do something that gives you money, that's normal.","I always wanted to act, but I never thought it would be my profession. I thought that I'd end up doing other things, but that in the meantime I'd do plays.","Life certainly points it out to you - 'you can go this way or the other way.' You have to decide and it's a very strong decision because, would you sleep well knowing that you're living in the best place, but you're letting the place where you should live alone?","A boxing workout is the heaviest thing, but it's the best. The worst part is that boxing gyms are the smelliest things in the universe. You have to lie down on the floor, where everyone has been sweating and spitting, and do 1,000 situps and push-ups.","I always laugh a lot when I see the dramas that I end up doing. I see myself behaving very seriously and I'm like, 'What is this?'","It's very difficult to raise money, especially in the United States, for independent movies.","We all have a cross-gender character: Every woman has a man that they can play, and every man has a woman that they can play.","Recently I've been doing risottos. Some of them have been amazing. Some of them, not all of them.","Every democracy is constructed day-to-day. And the electoral process reduces and minimalizes every single aspect of human complexity. We're putting it into pamphlets. We're doing a publicity show. We're becoming symbols.","Let's not give the electoral process so much importance. We have to be cynical about it. Let's give importance to the real democracy that's constructed on a day-to-day basis. That's my hopeful perspective on it.","In English, I'm a little bit limited. I speak English as a second language, and that's a little limitation that I have to work around and I have to use it to my favor. So, yes, that's why I end up wanting to do more things in Latin America.","I didn't know I wanted to do films until I started to do them. Very few films are made in Mexico and film-making belonged to a very specific group, a clique.","When it's good, cinema can be one of the most important things in a person's life. A film can be a catalyst for change. You witness this and it is an incredibly spiritual experience that I'd never lived before; well, maybe only in a football match.","I've never cared for the idea of a career path, or where a film might 'take me.' My love is for acting not money, so I only take on roles that I find challenging, in stories I find interesting.","I was brought up the Mexican way, where actors are paid very little and every part you take is an act of faith. If people respect that, then great.","Films, fiction, can encompass a whole global vision on a particular subject with any story, whatever it is. You can play the story in whatever country with whatever language in whatever style you want to tell the story in.","Alexander Gonzalez Inarritu is a great director. He's the one I first worked with. He's amazing.","We have a documentary film festival in Mexico. It's really original. It's called Ambulante, and it's a film festival that travels around several cities in Mexico.","In terms of work, obviously acting is such a job that is very in the flesh kind of thing. It's your work, but it's your life, in a way. You can get so mixed up.","It's not easy to act, but to direct to act. It goes form one place to the next. It's not heading for the punchline, and also it's not about scoring goals. It's about passing the ball, and the goals will come by themselves.","Talking about food is like talking about your dreams. Everyone has something to say. We all have to eat, it's just what we eat which differs. Some people eat for fuel and I feel bad for them.","In Mexico we have a trick - add a crystal of salt to the kettle and the tea tastes better, almost English. But after four pots, your kettle's broken.","Talent survives and remains while beauty is diluted.","Histories are to educate so that we understand better for ourselves and for motivation.","The type of music we know as classical music began with rich people hiring musicians or owning them in a way. Without funding, it's very hard to have this experience. Be it state money or private money, there has to be someone dedicated to raising the money.","You can't be happy in a place like London when you don't have money.","Theatricality is a concept. It's not a specific language.","My mom had me when she was 19 or 20. And my father was 22 or something. They were working on whatever they could, both of them aiming to be actors in theater.","My parents separated when I was very small. I grew up with my mother, and I was a single child then. She was very independent, doing her things and having fun alone and working.","In general, I hate films that are overtly either very masculine or very feminine, you know? The same way that I don't like a war movie about soldiers smashing people's heads. But a chick flick I like would be Cassavetes' movies. 'A Woman Under the Influence,' 'Husbands.'","In order to do 'Amores Perros,' I had to skip some time at drama school, so the director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu came up with a great Latin American solution, which was to say I had a tropical disease and had to stay in Mexico for a while. Everyone believed me.","In Mexico, audiences want to see a big discussion around a film - what we expect from Hollywood films worldwide is more of an entertaining show. 'Y Tu Mama Tambien' was a road movie and comedy, but it had a very strong political connotation that sparked a discussion in Mexico that is still going on.","Comedy requires a lot of energy.","If anybody is interested in listening to good modern music, I would recommend Jim Fassett, 'Symphony of the Birds.' It's really beautiful... with real birds.","As actors, we don't shy away from saying, 'I wanted to be an actor because I wanted to meet girls.' Directors cannot say the same thing.","People still say to me, 'What, you still live in Mexico?' I don't have to go to the United States simply to find work, and I don't have to stop what I'm doing. I mean, which Hollywood film beats 'The Motorcycle Diaries?'","I don't know, a lot of people go crazy about 'Breaking Bad,' but I don't like the soap opera aspect of it and only following one character. I like the context to all of it, all the pieces, like 'The Wire.' It's more about the state of things; it's not about the narrative of a person.","If we do a little bit of insight into history, how many times have there been people doing hate discourse, blaming everything on a certain group of people. That really is the genesis of genocide, where it kind of sparks.","Everywhere in the world, we're aware that democracy has incredible flaws and that the word has been used, especially in the United States, to wage wars.","The whole Baja California peninsula is an energetic place, and it's incredibly alive.","Los Cabos has been an amalgam of many cultures that have been coming here. There have been beautiful Jesuit missions for example, in many places around this area. The towns are incredible. But there is a very strong Mexicanized culture here that exists because people from different parts of Mexico have come to live here.","My story about becoming an actor is a completely non-romantic one. I became an actor because my parents were actors, and it seemed like a very... I knew I was going to act all my life, but I didn't know that I was going to be a professional actor. I thought I was just going to work as an actor every now and then.","It's difficult to act in a language that's not your own. It takes a long time to put your head around it and feel confident with it.","I would love to work with Martin Scorsese.","I'm never going to be able to leave Mexico, really. It would be foolish of me to do it. I would be wasting such a great opportunity that the accident of life, or destiny, gave me, which is to be Mexican. If we would make 'Lord of the Rings' analogies, I think Mexico City is Middle-earth. That's where the fight of humanity is.","'Motorcycle Diaries' had the best costumes - that battered jacket and those linen shirts. I wear linen shirts in real life, too, and I have a nice, simple number I got handed down. As a father, you just stop buying stuff for yourself. It's all for the kids.","Little remnants from everywhere I've been are scattered around my home. I collect rocks in a weird way, with stones from around the world as mementos. I've also got three haranas, which are little guitars.","HeyHey is my favourite app. It's like Instagram but for sound recordings, with little soundbites from people's days. We spend far too much time looking down at our phones, so it's nice to have your head up while you listen to what other people have uploaded."],"Gagan Narang":["Shooting is very challenging because 10 metre air rifle you have different rules, short gun you have different rules.","Cricket is a self-sustaining industry; but corporates need to realise that other sports don't have that luxury. This is the time when they need to invest, and keep the faith. Every sport has the potential to create world champions. Imagine India as a country full of world champions. Why imagine? Let's just make it happen.","Sporting culture is needed where marks are given to students for sports in schools, jobs are assured for sportsperson, and sponsors are willing to support them through rough times.","As kids, we have all handled shot guns. From there on, there is no transition. It stays in the toy box. The idea is to get the transition and bridge the gap between the toy box and the shooting range.","Now I know the difference between a rousing reception and a pat on the back. Now I know the difference between a gold in Commonwealth Games and a bronze in Olympics.","I am glad. I am now an Olympic medallist.","Not much is done to promote non-cricket sports in India. There is a lot of talk about how sports needs to reach the grassroots and how it should be introduced as a subject in school, but nothing has been done to that effect.","Cricket pays well, so a lot of people are naturally drawn towards the game. But to carve a niche in non-cricket sports is not easy. So state governments need to be proactive. Indians need to be made aware of the power of an Olympic medal. It should be treated at par with an Oscars or a Nobel Prize.","When kids my age were picking up toy cars, I used to buy toy guns.","Olympics is everyone's dream.","All of world's eyes are trained on the Games. So winning at that stage is heroic. It is a different feeling altogether and cannot be explained in words.","For your friends and family, you are always a champion, but for the media and sponsors, not until you show a spark. Making a champ is more important than celebrating one. I want to be there for youngsters and help them do their best.","I think country needs to have a sporting culture. I think if sports were taken as curriculum in school and are encouraged in right way like government of Maharashtra and Haryana have done given Marks for Sports and encouraging them with good jobs.","Sport is an important part of the development of kids, and hence, it should be made a part of their curriculum.","There was a time when my parents had to sell off a plot of land so that I can buy a rifle for competitive tournaments. After that we stayed in a rented house for the next 15 years.","To compare Olympic sport with cricket would not be fair. Years back, cricket was a sport only for the classes, and we will also have to make other sports masses from classes like cricket.","People need to take as much interest in other sports as they take in cricket, and that's where we come across a vicious cycle of performance, sponsorship, recognition, jobs and TV visibility. It's a typical chicken-and-egg story; each one is directly related to the other without an answer for what comes first."],"Gage Golightly":["I personally don't think you should ever date someone you work with, will work with, etc. I won't ever date an actor.","I'm a total loner. I can't even answer texts or take my phone with me when I'm working!","I get paid to go work with people I've admired since forever, and I get to learn from them? What? I would pay to go sit and be a fly on the wall!"],"Gail Carriger":["Laughter is healing and helpful and fun, and I see my role as an entertainer, and I want readers to leave my books smiling.","When all else fails, dress beautifully and throw your food.","I pretty much will do anything for a laugh.","Occasionally, if I am very confident in the establishment, I'll risk an egg salad on Dutch crunch, but I must be very confident indeed.","I like powerful women, and I gravitate to any point in history when a female has significant power. I can spend hours researching any such amazing lady, from Ching Shih to Hatshepsut to Boudica to Zenobia.","I love stand-up comics, particularly those who have embraced podcasting.","To me, steampunk and urban fantasy are naturally hinged together. And I think that's because I love the early gothic Victorian literature, and both things spring from that movement.","It seems to me that Halloween is the perfect time to get all over steampunk.","I like certain subgenres within science fiction and fantasy, and one of those is urban fantasy, and another is steampunk.","I consider science fiction and fantasy my genre. And I've noticed over the years that there doesn't tend to be a lot of lighthearted, comedic stuff.","At least half my writing time is spent researching. So for every hour I'm actually clicking on the keyboard, I'm spending another hour trying to figure out some tiny detail I need answered.","Most people in archeology find their specialties in strange and unique ways. I always wanted to do archaeology, and then the time came for me to actually be in the field, and it was excruciatingly boring. Excavation is really, really boring.","As a field archeologist, one usually has to specialize in a particular part of the world or specific culture, whereas if one is a materials specialist, one can jump around to different areas. So I've had experience on excavations all over the place.","I don't want my writing to be work to read. My main goal is completely shameless entertainment. I want people to smile and giggle and enjoy the book. I'm not trying to save the world through literature.","I do hold very strongly that tea is better in England. There's something in the milk. They must have special cows.","I get really flowery and verbose in my adult books, but I don't think I dumb down my Y.A. It's just cleaner and more snappy. And the adult books have multiple points-of-view. In my Y.A., it's always third person from the main character's perspective.","I love the Victorian era, and I always have, but I had a leg up on the writing because I was familiar with a lot of the science from the Victorian era. And that led to a massive interest in the science of this time of history.","Most of the names in my books have secondary meaning. Sometimes they foreshadow; sometimes they tell you about the character's origin or back story.","My absolute favorite food of all time is alpaca.","I'm a Reuben kinda girl, but I'll take a BLT with avocado in a red hot minute if it comes on ciabatta.","To the best of my knowledge, my youngest reader is 10 and the oldest is 95.","As for genre, my adult books are usually filed under science fiction / fantasy, although some stores put them into romance, and few have stuck them into horror. I consider all my books a mix of steampunk and urban fantasy.","I like to spoof the original Gothic classics, so there is also good dose of comedy in the 'Parasol Protectorate' - giggling readers are good.","Smoke machines are the best!"],"Gail Carson Levine":["Encourage children to write their own stories, and then don't rain on their parade. Don't say, 'That's not true.' Applaud flights of fantasy. Help with spelling and grammar, but stand up and cheer the use of imagination.","I grew up in New York City. In elementary school, I was a charter member of the Scribble Scrabble Club, and in high school, my poems were published in an anthology of student poetry.","I didn't want to be a writer. First I wanted to act, and then I wanted to be a painter like my big sister.","My interest in the theater led me to my first writing experience as an adult. My husband David wrote the music and lyrics and I wrote the book for a children's musical, 'Spacenapped' that was produced by a neighborhood theater in Brooklyn.","Most of my job life has had to do with welfare, first helping people find work and then as an administrator. The earlier experience was more direct and satisfying, and I enjoy thinking that a bunch of people somewhere are doing better today than they might have done if not for me.","I wrote as a kid, but I never wanted to be a writer, particularly. I had been drawing and painting for years and loved that.","I found that I was much more interested in writing and that I didn't like the illustrating at all. I had always been the hardest on myself when I drew and painted. I am not hard on myself when I write. I like what I write, so it is a much happier process.","Contemporary fiction is the hardest for me because I am not really in the popular culture - I don't watch TV.","I have a very vivid memory of the way my parents spoke, and the 50's that I grew up in are closer to the 20's, I think, than today in many, many ways.","I make mistakes on a very grand scale.","My good ideas are shy. But if they see that I treat the stupid ideas with respect, they come forward.","I loved fairy tales as a kid, so that's where my mind gravitates.","'EIla Enchanted' began in a marvelous writing course at New York City's The New School.","I had to write something and couldn't think of a plot, so I decided to write a Cinderella story because it already had a plot! Then, when I thought about Cinderella's character, I realized that she was too much of a goody-two-shoes for me, and I would hate her before I finished ten pages.","As a child, I loved fairy tales because the story, the what-comes-next, is paramount. As an adult, I'm fascinated by their logic and illogic.","It feels presumptuous to think of writing for adults.","Most of the authors I liked were dead, so it didn't seem like a safe occupation.","I was excited to make my own 'Neverland.'","Ideas sometimes come from nowhere, and sometimes they take lots of thinking.","Managing to tell a story is very gratifying.","If a big person invests time in reading, kids learn reading is important, the child is important, words are important, stories are important.","Get to know your kids' minds and how they think.","Sometimes the kids come up with better endings than the real story."],"Gail Collins":["Illegal immigration can never be completely stopped, no matter how high the wall or how many patrol agents you have watching it.","Texas is a great place to be rich and a terrible place to be poor. It's got the highest percentage of people without health insurance in the country. If you get injured on the job, good luck getting workers' comp. And God help you if you're poor and mentally ill.","You reduce illegal immigration by making it harder to get jobs here, or easier to get jobs south of the border. This idea that we can't pass an immigration law until we hit some imaginary security target is just a way to derail reform.","The history of American women is about the fight for freedom, but it's less a war against oppressive men than a struggle to straighten out the perpetually mixed message about women's role that was accepted by almost everybody of both genders.","Once you're done being president, you tend to want to defend your record more than plumb your inner feelings. I find it hard to imagine Obama going home at night and writing sensitive, introspective journal entries about his meeting with John Boehner.","There are competing studies on how much crime drops or doesn't drop when there are strict rules on gun possession and sale. I don't think there's any question that New York City's very tough laws have reduced violence.","Now my poor hometown is being castigated as the center of an IRS scandal. Humble workers at the Cincinnati office targeted Tea Party groups and other conservative organizations for special scrutiny when those groups applied for tax-exempt status. There's no conceivable excuse for that. It was deeply, deeply wrong.","The IRS targeting certain groups for harassment because of their politics would be unfair. If we found out the NSA was keeping special tabs on everyone who worshiped at a mosque or took a Bible trip through the Middle East, you'd have an uprising.","The history of American women is all about leaving home - crossing oceans and continents, or getting jobs and living on their own.","I kind of think that if you show conspiracy theorists a photo of the dead Bin Laden they will come up with an explanation for why it's really a Photoshopped picture of Bin Laden asleep. Or his dead cousin Fred. Donald Trump apparently believes that Bin Laden is dead, so that ought to be enough for the Middle East.","When the women's movement started in the 1960s, there was a vision of a future where women didn't wear makeup or worry about how their hair looked, and everybody wore sensible, comfortable clothes. It ran into an absolute brick wall.","For the undocumented immigrants, the big priority is just to get out from the shadows, be able to get a driver's license, buy an airplane ticket and stop worrying about sudden deportation. But for the country as a whole, it's crucial that everybody have a citizen's stake in the nation's welfare.","I did some research once on the way people in the past imagined the year 2000. They tended to picture the things they already had getting more sophisticated - flying cars, self-cleaning windows. And the folks in the early 1900s had a wildly optimistic estimate of the future of pneumatic tubes.","The idea that 'if you don't like how things are going, you can just leave' is so ingrained in Texas, the secession movement is no surprise.","When I started giving talks about women's history, one of the things that bothered me was the tendency to say, 'Well, everybody was totally oppressed and suddenly in 1964 we rose up, got our freedom, and here we are.' It dismisses the women who fought for rights for several hundred years of our history up to that point.","Some of our national heroines were defined by the fact that they never nested - they were peripatetic crusaders like Susan B. Anthony, Clara Barton, Sojourner Truth, Dorothy Dix.","The middle of 'America's Women' is about the Civil War, and how women, black and white, confronted slavery and abolition. As in every other period of crisis, the rules of sexual decorum were suspended due to emergency.","My only thought about Margaret Thatcher is the same one I had about Ronald Reagan. I hated a lot of what they did, but once in a while a country just needs a change.","When the simple word processors came in, writing became crisper, less dense - just because of the way we could instantly edit on the screen. Now the ability to mash up words and pictures and links and songs and tweets is what matters. I can't imagine what writing will be like in 2154.","For a border state, I would argue that Texas is less lunatic on the subject of immigration issues than other places around it, like Arizona. They're much more comfortable with their long-term identity as a place with a very large Hispanic population.","I just really like Houston despite its craziness. There is a sense of energy and a kind of excitement, 'We're going places and God knows what'll happen next.' It's very interesting. It's very exciting.","You know what Americans are really sensitive to? Issues of fairness. I think this is a modern phenomenon, born of the civil rights movement. Once you convince Americans that something is basically unfair, you've got a winning cause.","Back in the '70s when my friends in California were at Berkeley, in-state tuition was around $700 a year.","The work-family divide is the biggest issue for American women. But in some ways it's amazing how adjusted society has become to it. In the 1970s, as women began to take more jobs, society was reeling.","Women are needed in the military because there aren't enough soldiers, and we're seeing more women serve.","The fantasy I've always had is that somehow I could move back in time. I would like to be there when Susan B. Anthony was dying, or someone like that. I would say to her, 'You won't believe what's going to happen.' And then I would tell her.","Women in America will have to find an answer for the pressures of work and family, but if you really care about women's issues you have to think about women in the world, especially Africa, Asia and the Middle East.","If you live in a place that you perceive to be a crowded place, you appreciate government; you see it as this thing that protects you against crime, that keeps order, that makes sure that nobody puts a massage parlor next to your house, that keeps other people's dogs from pooping on the sidewalk.","Any time you write history, you insert your opinion. You pick and choose what you are going to write about. I feel really happy not inserting myself. I spend too much of my life inserting myself. It's just great to let other people carry the narrative.","Hillary Clinton almost got to be president. The reasons why she didn't become president had to do with bad judgments about how to handle the early caucus states, which is not a gender-specific trait.","Sarah Palin is treated like a bimbo sometimes, but she has never given the public the respect they deserve. She acts silly and doesn't know stuff. She didn't even finish her term.","What naturally you want to do if you were a prominent person in the public light and you are disgraced, you want to make a comeback, and normally that begins with somebody saying, 'I want to do something to help people. I want to do something to help the lepers in the Third World. I want to do something to help abandoned wives in India.'","Natural Texas politicians make terrible, terrible presidential candidates. Phil Gramm, I remember the 'Phil Gramm for President' campaign. I thought that was the worst thing in the history of the world, but Rick Perry was possibly worse.","The Bushes were certainly part of Texas in their mind, but they didn't have the kind of political flavor that you normally find in Texas politicians. It's just Texas is such a unique place to itself that politically, at least so far, they haven't found anybody to play nationally.","The high point was that the people are really nice - despite the crazy politics - and I loved being there. The hardest part was knowing some of the things I was probably going to write about Texas would make those nice people very unhappy.","When the women's movement began, it was a middle-class phenomenon. Certainly, black women had other stuff to think about in the '60s besides a women's movement. Working-class women were slow to get into it.","The economic sense of possibility was so great when I was growing up that my parents had no question that I could do anything I wanted to do, even as a girl. I've always believed that the economics of a story intersects with the women's story - that stuff often happens at the time it happens because of the economy.","You hear younger women say, 'I don't believe I'm a feminist. I believe women should have equal right and I believe in fighting for the rights of other women, but I'm certainly not a feminist. No, no, not that!' It's just a word. If you called it 'Fred' would it be better?","In the 1960s, you had this booming economy, and you didn't really have enough men around to fill all the jobs. So there was this sudden demand that women come back and perform a lot of the white-collar and pink-collar roles that men had done before or that hadn't existed before.","The one big, humongous, immense thing that we didn't change, that we didn't figure out how to deal with is, if men and women are both going to work throughout their lives, who's going to take care of the kids?","Sarah Palin is an heir to the women's movement. She has not been constrained by gender. At no point in her life has she thought, 'I can't do that because I'm a woman.'","There are lots of reasons for that gap between men's and women's wages but to me, the big one is the work-family issue. Trying to juggle children and a job is tough under any circumstances, but especially if you're shooting for the kind of career that involves long hours at work and being on call 24-7.","The key to success for any woman who wants to have a really serious career and a family is to marry a guy who is going to take at least half the responsibility for the house and kids - and sometimes more than half.","It's possible that you have been told a time or 10 that you don't appreciate how tough your elders had it. It's true that, if you had been coming of age back in, say, 1960, you would probably be feeling more restricted, if only because you were doomed to spend your days in a skirt, nylon stockings and girdle.","You can hit as many revolutions as you want, but women are always going to wear uncomfortable shoes that look good.","Until Eleanor Roosevelt, there was only one or two First Ladies in all of American history who made an impact, who people could even have recognized or identified. And it's really only been since Jackie Kennedy that there's been this idea that the family life of the president is such a central thing.","Certainly Nancy Reagan had an extraordinary effect on her husband. I'm truly not sure that, say, Laura Bush had that much effect on the Bush administration. She certainly, you know, seems to be a nice person who I think the public likes. But I can't really put my finger on any huge impact she's had.","Billy Jean King could not get credit when her husband was in law school and she was winning the Wimbledon, because he had to sign the cards. You know, you had these cases in the '70s of women who were mayors who couldn't get credit unless their husbands signed for them.","My all-time favorite program in my entire life was 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer.'","As long as we decline to allow sick, uninsured people to just lie down and die on the side of the road, everybody has to have insurance for the health care system to work sanely.","Can I say that I think it should be against the law for one state to use taxpayer money to try to bribe businesses in another state to move? Which then causes the target state to use taxpayer dollars to try to bribe the businesses to stay.","I'm sort of suspicious of most economic development projects, but the ones that encourage taxpayer-funded relocation bidding wars should be declared unconstitutional.","Texas has no income tax, which is a big draw for corporate executives who do business there. But it's hardly tax-free. The property taxes are high for a Southern state. The sales taxes are high. One study found that the bottom 20 percent of the Texas population pays 12 percent of its income in state and local taxes.","I think voters want somebody who understands their problems. You're right that they don't expect the president to fix everything. When he's wrestling with Congress and Wall Street and the rest of the world, they hope he'll be looking at things from their vantage point.","My own dream is that we discover that the NSA has been secretly keeping files on members of the National Rifle Association.","During the Obama years, the Republicans have done an unprecedented amount of stonewalling on cabinet-and-below appointees. I would also argue that their war on judicial nominees has been way beyond what went before. Really, if the president nominated God to serve on the D.C. Court of Appeals, Mitch McConnell would threaten a filibuster.","Personally, I'd be really glad to have a national conversation about whether to outlaw most forms of birth control. For once, the kids and their grandparents would find themselves on the same side.","Despite my excellent mood, I don't have any sympathy for Romney. If he'd been a good candidate he wouldn't have had a different campaign for every month on the calendar.","Downplaying their faults is pretty much the point of campaigns. But we do count on them living with the constant terror of public rejection.","There are a lot of people in Congress who would never have made a great career or fortune in any other profession. But after they spend a while hanging out with the rich guys, they begin to feel they've been undervalued, and that an eventual seven-figure income as a lobbyist isn't just an opportunity, it's their due.","If immigration reform passes, it'll be a big victory for sanity - nobody really believes it's healthy for a country to have millions and millions of undocumented noncitizens living in the shadows. But it'll also be a sign that the Republican Party has gotten tired of letting the Tea Party push it around.","To be honest, I haven't seen much serious budget planning since the Republicans took control of the House after the 2010 elections and grabbed onto the Senate filibuster. It's not the White House's fault that John Boehner couldn't deliver on a bigger deal.","I am prepared to admit that when it comes to dealing with the House and Senate leaders, Obama is terrible. But he's great with the public. Which hates the House and Senate as much as he does.","For years I've been hearing 20-somethings say they don't expect Social Security to be around when they hit 65. Eventually, I came to realize that they really mean that they just don't expect to be 65. Or 40. Neither did I, when I was 22.","I can't tell you how many times I've had conversations with politicians who've done something morally reprehensible but not indictable, yet still think they should be able to stay in office. The office isn't a 'right.' It's a kind of loan.","One line I'd draw would be on raising the eligibility age for Social Security and Medicare. It sounds fair, since people are living longer. But it isn't. Lower income workers are the ones who find it hardest to keep working after 65. And they'll get penalized with lower benefits.","In college, the guys aren't worrying about whether they'll be able to pursue their career dreams and still have kids.","How do you give smart, accomplished, ambitious women the same opportunities as men to reach their goals? What about universal preschool and after-school programs? What about changing the corporate mind-set about the time commitment it takes to move up the ladder? What about having more husbands step up and take the major load?","Take Hispanic voters. They favor Democrats because they like the party's programs, from health care reform to government spending on education. It's not because the Republicans don't have a big enough Office of Hispanic Outreach.","Once when I was working for the Daily News, I was summoned back to work from vacation because Donald Trump announced he was getting a divorce.","I picked up my college copy of 'The Great Gatsby' in an attempt to recover from the movie and was interested to find out what I'd underlined. The answer was basically: everything.","I grew up in one of the most socially conservative neighborhoods in Ohio, and my parents were traditional Catholics. But in her old age, my mother got her home health care from a guy who was gay, who was wonderful to her. Before she died, she rode a float in the Cincinnati Gay Pride Parade.","Well, it'd certainly be fascinating if we discovered that gays were better at being married than heterosexuals are. Talk about irony.","There have been tons of politicians who were slow to accept equal rights when it meant changes in the established social order. Many eventually came around, admitted they were wrong, and were forgiven. But the ones who actively choose hate-mongering don't ever get a pass.","Conservatives were sure that if you eliminated welfare for single moms, it would eliminate - or at lease greatly reduce - single motherhood. So in 1996 we had welfare reform. Did not change the trend in the least. Soon half of all babies will be born out of wedlock.","I'm being driven crazy by people who are obsessed with limiting the scope of government, but feel perfectly free to demand that government get involved in women's most personal choices.","Whenever you bring up women's internal workings, guys want to change the subject. Unless, of course, they're trying to change the laws.","You know, I have a lot of books on my iPad, but when I try to read them, I find myself wandering off to play games. Those are books I'm interested in. I can't imagine what would have happened to me in college if my biology class had been on the same computer as 'Words With Friends' and 'Doom.'","This is the moment when I should also admit that when the Internet first arrived I kept telling people it was a fad.","Non-crazy gun advocates - the ones who aren't stockpiling in preparation for a zombie invasion - don't like the idea of expanding background checks because they think it'll be a lot more paperwork. And it probably would make it more difficult to sell guns at, say, a flea market.","The Tea Party people say they're angry about socialism, but maybe they're really angry about capitalism. If there's a sense of being looked down upon, it's that sense of failure that's built into a system that assures everyone they can make it to the top, but then reserves the top for only a tiny fraction of the strivers.","When people say this isn't the America they grew up in, they're right. Nobody gets to grow old in the America they grew up in.","The whole student loan thing drives me completely nuts. If it wasn't possible for 18-year-olds to sign themselves up for tens of thousands of dollars in debt in order to pay their college bills, the state governments wouldn't have found it so politically easy to cut taxpayer support for public colleges and universities.","There's more student debt than credit card debt! Everywhere I go, I run into young people trying to build careers while they keep shelling out money on their education loans. If the economy is looking for a new generation of home-buyers, I can't imagine they'll get it from these folks.","One very clear memory I have of college is that I never learned anything in the big lectures. I have a feeling I'd have done even worse if they'd been on a laptop screen.","I used to like John McCain, too, but I must admit that was because he was bucking his party to do things I agreed with. I would not have had that reaction if, say, Bernie Sanders decided to rebel out of principle and support privatizing Social Security.","I admired the way McCain worked on campaign finance reform. I admired the way Nancy Pelosi stiffened the Democrats' spine during the health care debate. I admire the way Barack Obama has raised a dog in the White House without ever putting it on the roof of the car for a vacation drive.","At the beginning of his administration, Obama homed right in on Medicare, which he wanted to fix by reducing the overall cost of health care in this country. He risked everything - some would claim he lost everything - by being so single-minded.","I don't think the folks in the low-tax states really want to go into a fairness discussion. Residents of Connecticut and New York would love to remind them how much they pay in federal taxes to support programs for Mississippi and South Dakota.","Elections have to have at least a little meaning. Obama ran on income tax hikes for the wealthy. People knew they were voting for that. They 'want' that. And it's good policy.","Bin Laden wasn't all that central to the terrorist network any more, but taking him down created a kind of national catharsis. It's been a really, really long time since we had something to celebrate that didn't involve a sports team. I'd rather it had been a non-death-related occasion, but we'll take what we can get.","I used to have a sort of soft spot for Huckabee. He seemed to have a genuinely saintly streak, which caused him to defend illegal immigrants and give pardons to criminals who were perhaps a little less rehabilitated than he had imagined.","I have always believed the iron rule of politics was that women don't vote for men who yell.","There's always been that theory that if a candidate can't run a decent campaign, he probably can't run a decent presidency. That might be true, although sadly I must admit that running a brilliant campaign does not translate into running a brilliant White House.","You know, I really miss sex scandals. They're generally colorful. They almost never mean anything over the long run. And while they're going on, the people who actually keep the government running are let alone to go about their business. Good old sex scandals.","Gay rights is just a matter of time. Look at the polls. Worrying about gay marriage, let alone gay civil unions or gay employment rights, is a middle-age issue. Young people just can't see the problem. At worst, gays are going to win this one just by waiting until the opposition dies off."],"Gail Devers":["Keep your dreams alive. Understand to achieve anything requires faith and belief in yourself, vision, hard work, determination, and dedication. Remember all things are possible for those who believe.","Sometimes we fall, sometimes we stumble, but we can't stay down. We can't allow life to beat us down. Everything happens for a reason, and it builds character in us, and it tells us what we are about and how strong we really are when we didn't think we could be that strong.","When I write a goal down - and I truly write them down - it becomes a part of me. That's a contract that I sign with myself to say, 'I don't care what happens - I'm going to stay on this path. I'm going to try and see this through; I'm going to give it my best shot, my best effort.'","It's not what other people believe you can do, it's what you believe.","It's not what other people believe you can do; it's what you believe you can do.","In my race, there's 10 hurdles, but in life, there is always a hurdle. There is always something you gotta get over, and it's what you do, you know.","People talk about retiring. I never said that r-word. People though I went away after the Olympic Games. I took time off to do something I've always wanted to be - a mother.","I was diagnosed with Graves' disease, an illness of the thyroid gland. Instead of surgery, I was given radiation treatment.","A lot of times when I ran, to be honest, I didn't know where I was in the race. So I always was looking up at the scoreboard to say, 'Just call my name to see where I am,' because I tried to have such tunnel vision not to distract myself.","Looking back, I'm so proud to have gone to five Olympics - I believe only three other Americans have achieved that. My true gold medal, though, is my daughter, Karsen, who is 18 months old. And I have a wonderful husband, Mike.","I don't have a thyroid anymore. I had radioactive iodine treatment, which destroyed my thyroid. I take medication every day.","In February 1991, I was rushed to the hospital in Los Angeles to have my feet amputated. Three years earlier, I had broken the national 100 meters hurdles record while a student at UCLA and was a favourite for the event at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.","People see me now and ask if I'm still running. I may look like I am, but I'm really not. People think I still run every day but I ran for 25 years and I deserve to not do anything but walk or ride the bike with my kids.","I was blessed with a long career where I won gold medals for myself and my country. Nothing stands out as a disappointment.","We go old-school during the summer, like swimming or setting up lemonade stands. I try to teach my kids to make their own fun.","It's a challenge between me and the hurdle, and the hurdle has always won.","Looking back, I'm so proud to have gone to five Olympics - I believe only three other Americans have achieved that.","It's totally different now, traveling to different meets and different cities and actually being able to enjoy the cities I'm in.","I have to be cautious, have my thyroid levels checked, and as long as I do that, I'm fine.","I have a real passion for children. I always wanted to teach and only became an athlete because my parents told my brother Parenthesis and me that we should use any God-given talent we had.","My grandma passed away at 98 1/2 and I want to live to 100. I want to be able to do what I can do even at 100.","I didn't get nervous when I ran, but I get nervous watching other people now. I root for anybody with a USA on their chest.","While receiving radiation treatment for a thyroid illness, I had refused to take beta-blockers - a medication that would have eased its side effects - because they were deemed illegal by the sport's governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations.","I have a real passion for children. I always wanted to teach and only became an athlete because my parents told my brother Parenthesis (sic) and me that we should use any God-given talent we had.","I never read my press when I was competing. I never got caught up in what I was doing at that moment.","I always said a prayer before I ran, and my prayer was to win. My prayer was that God would allow me to run my best on that day, or better than my best. So whatever the outcome is, I have to be satisfied with it if I know I gave it my best effort.","I am very thankful that I have lived the life I have lived. I am thankful for my Graves' disease, and I tell people, if I had my whole life to live over, I would have it, because it has really made me into the person that I am."],"Gail Godwin":["Good teaching is one-fourth preparation and three-fourths pure theatre.","One is taught by experience to put a premium on those few people who can appreciate you for what you are.","The act of longing for something will always be more intense than the requiting of it.","The race of children possesses magically sagacious powers.","Dreams say what they mean, but they don't say it in daytime language.","None of us suddenly becomes something overnight. The preparations have been in the making for lifetime."],"Gail Kelly":["I'm a very consistent leader, and people won't find me different day to day. You won't have to have the sort of conversation that says, 'How is she today? Is this a good day to have this conversation?' You won't find that situation with me. I treat people with respect.","You can choose not to sit on the fence. You can choose not to criticise. You must stand as guard at the door of your own mind and choose to be positive.","In this digital age, there is no place to hide behind public relations people. This digital age requires leaders to be visible and authentic and to be able to communicate the decisions they've made and why they've made them, to be able to acknowledge when they've made a mistake and to move forward, to engage in the debate.","Whatever you are doing, give it all of your attention. Prioritise what you're going to do carefully, and then be in the moment.","Nelson Mandela was an outstanding leader and a mentor for me. I was in South Africa at the time he was released. I was in South Africa when he was inaugurated as the first president.","I'm a big believer you should design work around a vast majority of people who want to do the right thing rather than around the tiny minority who might take advantage.","Living in South Africa has had a very profound impact on my career.","42% of our management team are women. So we've reset the goal to 50% by 2017. Because that's when Westpac becomes 200 years old as an institution - the oldest bank, and indeed the oldest company in Australia. So that's a lovely point to reflect on.","I have a very genuine care for individuals; I have a very genuine sense of the power of individuals to make a difference, a very genuine belief that people matter, a very genuine belief of wanting the very best for individuals.","One of the joys of being at St. George is you were operating under the radar screen a lot of the time, and you could actually get on with things a lot more quickly and easily.","I grew up in a very strong, nuclear family. My father was a sportsman. He represented South Africa in a couple of sports, so he was a very positive person and someone who encouraged you to be your best and give your best with everything that you do.","When I got to be a CEO, I said: 'Right. I'm now going to tackle gender inequality head-on. I'm going to make a difference and lead by example and actively put in place policies and practices to support women.'","I have certainly been very front footed about increasing our gender representation at Westpac."],"Gail O'Grady":["I think the paparazzi is a necessary evil... and if ya don't like it, and ya don't want to do this, go to Iowa and do some community theatre. It's all about self-promotion, and it's not always the fun part of it.","The only reality show that I do tune in for is 'Shark Tank.'"],"Gail Parent":["Laughter made you live better and longer.","She knew what all smart women knew: Laughter made you live better and longer.","Volleyball is a Jewish sport. It's fun, and nobody can get hurt.","How do you tell your mother that you feel you're getting... old? If I'm... old, then what is she?","When friends ask for a second cup they are open to conversation."],"Gail Porter":["So long as you've got your friends about you, and a good positive attitude, you don't really have to care what everyone else thinks.","What's so brave about being bald? I've not fought for my country or found the cure for cancer - I've just gone out without my hat on!","Bald is the new black!","Mmm, I love Yoda. I didn't like Jar Jar Binks though, he was all wrong.","I used to be pretty reckless. When I was a runner for a production company, I drove a massive 16 seater van. I was only 18. I mean I look young now, but then I looked about 12.","Usually I trundle about in trainers and baggy jeans, looking about as attractive as a potato.","Every day I do something that freaks me out.","I read everything and anything. I love books.","I read in the paper that I'd slashed my wrists. But I didn't.","People say, what is she thinking? I'm thinking: fun; cash; travel.","The more I read about feeding times, sleep times and waking-up times, the more inadequate and miserable I felt.","But I love New York. I used to set my alarm clock when I was there, and get up at 4am and get a coffee, just because I could.","I didn't have any problem bonding with Honey, but I was plagued with insecurities about my ability to bring up my baby.","Exercise keeps me occupied, which is good for my mental health.","You can go to the doctor a million times if you're feeling down, and get nowhere, but if you go for a run it makes you feel really good.","I do tend to overdo everything.","I do mixed martial arts, mainly kickboxing.","I love books.","I don't think I'm that intelligent. I think I'm semi-intelligent.","TV presenting isn't the hardest job in the world, and I've done all right financially out of it.","Love has no age.","Scotland is the best place in the whole world.","When I was bald, I went through a period where I seemed to do nothing except TV programmes about being bald.","I've always had an addictive nature.","I try to cope with everything through humor.","I'm a mum, so my wardrobe consists of sweaters and jeans. As long as I don't leave the house forgetting my jeans, I count that as a fashion success.","I just don't think men fancy me.","I want to break down some of the stigma associated with mental illness.","I'm always weeping at something or other.","I don't miss my pin-up days. I'm far too old for that malarkey.","I'm so bored of all these girls who have written about 20 books by the time they're 25.","I have tried therapy a couple of times, but it hasn't worked.","I like routine.","When you have children, that's your main focus.","I don't believe in God.","I have a problem with cleaning. It's my release. I get up at 6 A.M. and clean and hoover and mop everything. Then I feel better.","I know a lot of celebrity types go for Kabbalah and Scientology. But why pay 10 per cent of your earnings to someone when it's all common sense: treat others as you'd like to be treated yourself.","The greatest thing you can give a child is confidence.","My parents' marriage was very rocky. They were always arguing. When they split up when I was in my 20s, my brother and I were both delighted because we knew they weren't good for each other.","My mum brought me up to think that personal happiness is more important than your family.","My mother and I were very close and even when I left home and came to London I would ring her every day. She was very proud of me and loved my celebrity. She would often come to shoots and TV shows with me.","Mum's a worrier, she looked after everybody apart from herself - I think it runs in the family."],"Gail Sheehy":["The delights of self-discovery are always available.","Growth demands a temporary surrender of security.","Would that there were an award for people who come to understand the concept of enough. Good enough. Successful enough. Thin enough. Rich enough. Socially responsible enough. When you have self-respect, you have enough.","We really only have two choices. Play it safe, or take a chance. For me, pulling back because of fear has always made me feel worse.","I do think women can have it all - but not all women. If you take daring steps and are smart about it, you can probably have it all. But you might have to wait a while.","In rough times, pathfinders rely on work, friends, humor and prayer. They develop a support network.","If we don't change, we don't grow. If we don't grow, we aren't really living.","Creativity can be described as letting go of certainties.","If every day is an awakening, you will never grow old. You will just keep growing.","I actually like getting out of my comfort zone. It shakes me up.","Sex and older women used to be considered an oxymoron, rarely mentioned in the same breath.","Stress overload makes us stupid. Solid research proves it. When we get overstressed, it creates a nasty chemical soup in our brains that makes it hard to pull out of the anxious depressive spiral.","Ah, mastery... what a profoundly satisfying feeling when one finally gets on top of a new set of skills... and then sees the light under the new door those skills can open, even as another door is closing.","Being a pathfinder is to be willing to risk failure and still go on.","People in grief need someone to walk with them without judging them.","The perceptions of middle age have their own luminosity.","No sooner do we think we have assembled a comfortable life than we find a piece of ourselves that has no place to fit in.","All changes, even the most longed for, have their melancholy; for what we leave behind is a part of ourselves; we must die to one life before we can enter into another!","I'd visually have that idea. I'm diving off the end of the diving board. I'm not going to be worried about if I'm going to dive into a jellyfish or the water's going to be too cold or the boys are going to beat me. I'm just doing it. And if I do it, it's a good chance I'll make it.","We see it in the body, that if you just give the body enough rest and comfort, it has remarkable self-healing capacities. Well, so does the spirit.","No one can control the aging process or the trajectory of illness.","If you begin to think you are solely responsible for keeping your loved one alive and safe, you will eventually find yourself playing God. This phase can develop into an unhealthy, codependent relationship.","We have to move from the unbridled pursuit of self-gain at the expense of others to recovering appreciation for what we gain by caring and sharing with one another.","The secret of a leader lies in the tests he has faced over the whole course of his life and the habit of action he develops in meeting those tests.","Adapting to our Second Adulthood is not all about the money. It requires thinking about how to find a new locus of identity or how to adjust to a spouse who stops working and who may loll, enjoying coffee and reading the paper online while you're still commuting.","Spontaneity, the hallmark of childhood, is well worth cultivating to counteract the rigidity that may otherwise set in as we grow older.","The dream for many millennial women is to make a difference as social or political entrepreneurs. They are using the social media and marketing tools they have mastered to empower less fortunate women and direct them onto career tracks that women have traditionally avoided, like science and technology.","When men reach their sixties and retire, they go to pieces. Women go right on cooking.","Changes are not only possible and predictable, but to deny them is to be an accomplice to one's own unnecessary vegetation.","To be tested is good. The challenged life may be the best therapist.","There is no more defiant denial of one man's ability to possess one woman exclusively than the prostitute who refuses to redeemed.","It is a paradox that as we reach out prime, we also see there is a place where it finishes.","Over the next few years the boardrooms of America are going to light up with hot flashes.","I do think taking the 20s to take the most chances you can is important, because you're not going to hurt anyone else during that time. And if you do have a partner, you need a couple years to rehearse that relationship.","I found the happiest woman in America is between 50 and 55, is happily married, has made significant progress in her career, and lives in a community where she can easily exercise outside. But the most important single thing was she had her last child before she was 35.","Eventually, all mentor-disciple relationships are meant to pull apart, usually sometime in the mid-30s. Those who hang on, eventually the mentor drops the disciple, and that's no fun.","It seems like, to me, somewhere between 30 and 35 is a really, really good time to turn your eggs into babies.","Character is what was yesterday and will be tomorrow.","In my memoir, I admit that I've been as fearful of success as of failure. In fact, when 'Passages' was published, I so dreaded bad reviews that I ran away to Italy with a girlfriend and our children to hide out.","It was so naive to think that there was nothing interesting that happened after 55. Come on, there's a whole second adulthood!","I actually interviewed other people about myself, and that alerted me to the fact that I had to really investigate my memories.","When I was immobilized by fear, I might have a panic attack. I've had a couple of panic attacks in my life.","I know I'm never going to probably see the Taj Mahal or, you know, climb Mt. Everest, but I can still maybe influence peoples' way of thinking by a story that I do, by something I learn about the world.","I'm a liberal, but I think there's so much that the private sector can do and does do.","Like everyone else in the first weeks after the tragedy of 9/11, I was looking frantically for some way to help.","I was devastated when I got the review for my first book. The book came out a couple years before the women's movement broke through, and people were putting it down, asking, 'Why does the woman in this book need to get a divorce? Why can't she just shut up and be happy?'","It was my very good fortune to find a mentor, Clay Felker, who started my career at the 'New York Magazine' as a freelance writer when I had to quit my job at the 'Herald Tribune' to stay home with my young daughter.","I did not give my daughter the kind of childhood anybody would want. The vision of the divided loyalty between a mother and father who don't live together and don't share in decisions is a great depravation for children.","I've had the experience of having a book praised but then it doesn't sell. Or not praised but then it sells.","If you're the person living closest to the parent who's going to need help, and you take on the whole role of primary caregiver, you can be pretty sure your sibling who lives farthest away is going to call you and say, 'You don't know what you're doing.' Because they're not on the spot, and they probably feel guilty.","This is something caregivers have to understand: You have to ask for help. You have to realize that you deserve to ask for help. Because you need to keep on working on your own life.","In the case of my husband, we found that facing a life-threatening illness prodded us to make a dramatic change in our lives.","The first thing one notices about Jill Abramson is her short stature. The second is her intensity.","Most women have learned a great deal about how to set goals for our First Adulthood and how to roll with the punches when we hit a rough passage. But we're less prepared for our Second Adulthood as we approach life after retirement, where there are no fixed entrances or exits, and lots of sand into which it is easy to bury our heads.","I keep returning to the central question facing over-50 women as we move into our Second Adulthood. What are our goals for this stage in our lives?","The feminist spirit still lives! It shows most boldly among younger women from the millennial generation.","Very few women manage to have it all; certainly not all at once.","Career-driven millennials are strategic about working obsessively while they are single and earning enough money to afford advanced education. Most are patient enough to wait until 30 or later to develop their dream.","You have a new role: family caregiver. It's a role nobody applies for. You don't expect it. You won't be prepared. You probably won't even identify yourself as a caregiver.","Family caregiving has become a predictable crisis. Americans are living longer and longer but dying slower and slower.","In 2009, I served as AARP's Ambassador of Caregiving. With a producer and cameraman, I traveled the country for months, interviewing hundreds of caregivers.","In the first phase of shock over, say, your mortgage being called in or your job washed out, it's essential to engage with others and share the fear, release the feelings, do fun things to take your mind off it.","I dare to do things - that's how I survive.","Married at 23, a mother at 24, and blindsided by divorce at 28, I found myself struggling, like many young women I meet today, to strike a balance between my personal life and my career.","You don't have to feel confident to act confident. In fact, it's the most important acting job you can learn.","One of the ways we women often handicap ourselves is thinking that once we've made a decision or a commitment, we can't change.","Jill Clayburgh's life so closely paralleled mine, I feel as though a part of me lived a little through her and died a little with her.","My husband, Clay Felker, died 17 years after his first cancer due to secondary conditions that developed from treatment.","Back in 1968, when I was 30, my entire life blew up. I had a life plan, and it collapsed for no rational reason.","Be willing to shed parts of your previous life. For example, in our 20s, we wear a mask; we pretend we know more than we do. We must be willing, as we get older, to shed cocktail party phoniness and admit, 'I am who I am.'","I found that female pathfinders generally integrate characteristics commonly associated with being women - like the capacity to be intimate - with 'male' ones like ambition and courage."],"Gail Simmons":["There is no better way to bring people together than with desserts.","I love The Inn at Palmetto Bluff, an Auberge Property in Bluffton, South Carolina. It's a spectacular corner of the world, with massive old trees lined with Spanish moss, and alligators swimming in the river.","Patience is the secret to good food.","It's better to get the nutrients for healthy skin from food, not supplements. Salmon, walnuts, blueberries, spinach... lots of my favorite foods happen to be amazing for skin too.","I'm tempted by everything. My husband makes fun of me because every day it's a new food that I love. I have a weakness for butterscotch pudding, ice cream in any flavor and dark chocolate, although that's one thing I do keep in my house - 70% dark chocolate.","Always wear sunscreen and wash your makeup off at night.","There are few women in America that don't want to lose 5 pounds, but I refuse to let that thought dominate my life. And there are too many other real problems in the world - real obesity problems and real hunger problems - to worry that much about a few pounds that I'd like to lose.","Find combinations of flavors you love and buy the best quality ingredients you can afford. Your food is only going to be as good as the sum of its parts, like anything else.","At the beginning of the week, I roast a ton of vegetables so I can use them for the next few days. I also plan out meals in advance.","When I'm cooking for myself, I find that I eat almost completely vegetarian, although I'm not vegetarian.","I wish I could say I was one of those people who loves working out, but I don't; it's just not that fun. But I make an effort to work out aggressively three times a week.","I also have a soft spot for spicy chicken wings. They are always best eaten at dives and sports bars, like Wogie's in the West Village, New York City, near my house.","I cannot go to Montreal without going to Beauty's, my favorite place for breakfast, where I have the Mish-Mash omelet with hot dogs, salami, eggs, green peppers, and onions, and the best banana bread in the world. It's legendary!","I run a solid 4-6 miles at a time, and over the last year two years I've gotten really into SoulCycle. It's sort of an evolved form of spinning.","Because I travel so much, I bring my workout clothes and shoes wherever I go. That way I can always do some exercise.","I'm a healthy weight for my height, and I like how I look on most days.","In America, Blackberry Farm in Tennessee is one of the most amazing hotels I've had the privilege of staying at.","I spend so much time in Los Angeles and normally stay at a corporate apartment when shooting 'Top Chef: Just Desserts,' but when I have the chance to stay somewhere more luxurious, I love The Montage in Beverly Hills.","I am a glutton for a beautiful hotel. I am so easily smitten by high thread counts.","Balance is key in cooking - you want a little acid, a little sweet, a little savory - the flavors should be harmonious.","Like baseball, food will never go out of style; we will always need to eat and we will always find it entertaining. I think of food TV this way - all the fun and none of the calories.","There's not a single chef I know of that does not think about the politics of the food they're serving.","First and foremost, you have to remember that restaurants are businesses and they have to stay in business. And though everyone thinks they want grass fed beef, most people actually prefer the taste of corn fed - it is less dry, more marbled, and less gamey, not to mention much less expensive than grass fed.","You don't get second chances in the real world.","I never really drank coffee in college, but now I'm on my feet all day and out all night and can't believe it hasn't always been in my life. When morning comes I crave it.","Patience was not something that came naturally to me, but in cooking it is the quintessential skill.","When I diced vegetables, it was painstaking work to make sure that every single piece looked the same: 1/4-inch cubed for small, 3/4-inch cubed for large. It's a matter of practice and precision.","I reveled in the most basic rules and techniques that are the foundation of professional cooking. For example, it is essential to use a sharp knife: the sharper the knife, the more fluid and precise your work and the less likely you are to get hurt. Dull knives are a danger - they slip far more often.","Canada is a big part of my life.","I sit at this really weird crossroads. My job requires me to take in calories. I take care of myself. I eat healthy. I exercise a lot. But then I have to go to events in cocktail dresses and look fancy, and people want to interview me about what I'm wearing, and then I'm compared to people who are wearing size 2 all the time.","The first thing people say to me when they meet me is, 'You're so much skinner in person.' You have to live up to these standards that are so unrealistic. I try to tune it out.","I had decided I wanted to write about food, and I knew the only way to do that is to speak with authority, which meant learning the language and knowing what that experience is like.","My husband works in the music industry and he's always the first to know about great new bands, so I end up seeming really with it because I'll be listening to an up-and-coming band before everyone else hears about it.","I would not say I'm an aggressive shopper. I want to be; I aspire to be an aggressive shopper. I am a meek, meek shopper.","You know, I lose patience really easily; I'd rather shop in the grocery store than in the department store. I can pick an apple like nobody's business.","I was very, very little - it was the first time I ever cooked on my own, with my mother's supervision - and I made scrambled eggs. I felt so accomplished, like magic!","Eating a lot is an occupational hazard but it's a pretty great problem to have. I spend a lot of time eating sweets on TV - cake, cupcakes, donuts, and pudding. It's a dream job, but at the same time there will be days where I wake up knowing I will eat 15 desserts!","There are days when I literally have to eat 17 plates of food - it's intense. It's about moderation. You just need a few bites to get the gist of a dish.","I have a mantra in my head that there will always be another meal. I can put my fork down, knowing there will be good things in my future!","The less you do to beautiful food, the better it's going to taste. You don't need to mess with it all the time.","My mother's kitchen was built to be the focal point of our house. I got into the kitchen often as a child.","Dark chocolate, and salt and vinegar chips are my weakness - but not together.","I cook mostly vegetarian vegetable and bean stews. Quinoa salads. I make my mother-in-law's recipe for chicken and barley stew all the time.","You can't fake being able to cook well.","If you don't use good ingredients, the outcome is never going to be excellent. But if you buy the freshest ingredients that are in season, at their peak, and you cook with them, you can't really go wrong.","A big thing that gets people in trouble in the kitchen is not reading the recipe from start to finish before you cook it. Before you start anything, read through the entire recipe once."],"Gail Simone":["My hope is that we can spread the word: Wonder Woman is not some unapproachable goddess. She's funny, dangerous, intimidating, brilliant, and compassionate. In many ways, I think she's the most human superheroine there is.","A lot of readers and a lot of editors had a story problem with Oracle, in that she made for such an easy, convenient story accelerator, that we missed the sense of having characters have to struggle to discover, to solve mysteries. Famously, it helped make Batman less of a detective and more of a monster hunter.","I always say, if a guy writes the same lead female character type over and over, we are not seeing their writing chops so much as their dating website wishlist.","When I started in comics, people were always trying to classify me as either/or. Either a writer who appealed to women or a writer who appealed to guys. This need to categorize was just exhausting.","I don't need every book to have female creators, I don't care if there are books that appeal mostly to guy readers. I don't care if some books have cheesecake. I am fine with all of that. It's the not allowing anything else that makes me furious.","'Batgirl' and 'Harley Quinn' are the first DC hit books in a while that aren't starring Batman personally, really. But some of the attempts to reach the female audience have been really depressing to me.","My thing with the Secret Six is that they never win. The odds are always against them; everyone wants them gone. So they never win. But they never give up, either.","I have a terrific editor in Molly Mahan - she's the best - and Red Sonja has become up there with Black Canary as my favorite character to write, ever.","I was a fan of the idea of Red Sonja, but the gender politics of the character made her hard to read, for me, at times.","I get asked a lot about writing for games and prose and film, and I will do some, but I can never see myself leaving comics. I love it too much.","I like DC, and I love the DC Universe. It's a source of never-ending joy to me.","I've always said my whole career that I wanted to write by the improv credo, 'don't negate,' which means, even if you didn't care for something, you try to make it work. You don't say, 'Oh, that particular story didn't happen.'","As time goes on, at both DC and Marvel, characters notch up so many victories that we often start to think of them as infallible, which is kind of death for adventure fiction.","I feel like Vertigo is a place to have an adult discussion for adult readers.","I just like to write stories about people who survive even very difficult, impossible things.","I've said this many times: I don't care which hero punches which hero to get the Infinity Jockstrap or whatever. I do care that people find humanity in these stories, and maybe something connects, makes the world a little better for having read it.","I feel humanity is often displayed in how we react to our mistakes and the misdeeds committed against us.","I have been involved in lots of crossover and event books, and the truth is, I dearly love them. I love stories that actually take advantage of the huge DC library and catalog - that stuff thrills me.","If you love Tarzan, you can read stories from the 'Jungle Tales of Tarzan,' where he's just a kid, all the way up until he has a son of his own and beyond. Same with 'Batman' - you can follow him from Gotham, as a kid, to 'Dark Knight,' as a cranky old weirdo. I really love that.","If you succeed at all, you find yourself suddenly working with artists whose work you don't just admire but you deeply love.","For me, even though I love, love, love both Cliff Chiang and Brian Azzarello, I haven't read the new '52 Wonder Woman' past the first issue. It's just... you know, once I'm on a book for a really long time... it's like going through a divorce. It takes a while before I can be 'friends again' with the character.","Ideas are not - ideas come at me all the time; it's just the way I'm wired. It's just a matter of focusing it in and figuring out what to do with that.","Secret Six has always had a special place in the DCU, just because they're the misfits. The content is a little bit different than the rest of the mainstream titles. It has a completely different tone than any of the other books out there.","What I feel responsible for is, if my name is on a comic, I want it to be the best-written comic that I can possibly do. I want it to include some new things we haven't seen before, new story ideas, new characters. Quality, quality art, all those kinds of things.","I've written, like, 450 comics, and 'Secret Six' was the first one I've had ship late, ever. So it took a lot to make that happen. So we had a little bit of a stop-and-start, and then we had Convergence, and then Issue No. 2 of 'Secret Six'.","I do a lot of book signings and conventions every year, and I meet a great many readers who are struggling... they're working through illness, injury, addiction, depression, grief, or some other trauma. It seems to me that there's a lot of heroism in fighting those things as well, as best you can.","A lot of action heroes, we're told they are heroic primarily because they commit violence upon the bad guy. It can be cathartic; it can be thrilling. But at some point, I think you want more from your heroes than just the ability and willingness to pummel someone.","Greg Rucka always writes lovely, believable female characters in books like 'Whiteout,' 'Queen and Country,' and 'Lazarus.' I am a fan of Kelly Sue DeConnick, who does a wonderful female lead in 'Captain Marvel.' And DC's 'Batwoman' is currently the only book at the Big Two with a lesbian solo lead character, and it's always outstanding.","One of the things I am most excited about personally is a five-issue anthology I put together, 'Legends of Red Sonja,' which is full of wonderful little short stories written exclusively by my favorite female writers of comics, prose, and gaming.","When I think about Plastic Man, he was genuinely the first funny super hero. I'm obviously attracted to that. There's also this great mixture of tragedy in there, too, that I love. The humor comes from a place of pain.","The stuff we're seeing in 'Deadpool' and 'Harley Quinn' now, Plastic Man was doing in the 1940s. It's a character that was ahead of its time back then and the stories are still funny and still relevant.","Nothing really prevented me from showing Catman as bi, but it's how I thought of him.","I think it's important to have diversity in comics for a thousand reasons. It's not just some airy conceptual thing: it's important to reflect the humanity of the readership.","Famously, DC has been pretty great showing gay women, with characters like Batwoman, but has shown fewer prominent men on the sexuality spectrum outside of hetero. It's something we need to address. I also think it's lovely how the readers respond to this.","I always look for a story that hasn't been told in the same way. I don't care about a lot of the usual elements people use for a quick drama boost. I want to know, for example, what happens when a man who was victimized by his father tries to be a father to a woman sixty years his senior.","People resist and fight against things that are new that they haven't seen before, especially if they make them uncomfortable. But fiction is a safe place to tell these stories and to reach out to people and maybe affect them and make a difference in their lives.","People who support Kickstarter, we love them all. We're so grateful we have these products out here that allowed us to keep the copyrights and own them and everything, but people don't realize just how massive an undertaking it is.","If you have something to say, especially that's different and needed, then do it.","The 'Womanthology' book got a lot of people jobs, inside and outside the industry, and I think stuff like that tends to be really effective. You have something in print that you can point an editor or a publisher to, and it makes a huge difference for a lot of people.","I have worked with a lot of great artists, including some of my heroes like Michael Golden, George Perez, and Jose Garcia Lopez, just to name a couple. I have been spoiled.","I love any books by Kelly Sue DeConnick or Marjorie M. Liu; it's lovely to have successful, talented female writers doing great work in comics.","I'm excited for Christy Marx taking over 'Birds of Prey'. I adore 'Rachel Rising' by the great Terry Moore. I'm also a stone cold Scott Snyder fan; the guy is a joy to read and a pleasure to work with.","Catman - what I really like about him is he's a really grounded character in terms of - he's an excellent tracker. We're giving him a set of new skills for 'Secret Six' as it starts again anew. But he's very sexy, very dangerous, unpredictable.","I think Tumblr tends to be - you can get more in-depth with things and more blogging, and Tumblr has been real great for me in terms of research because I have contacts with people from all walks of life all over the globe.","We have so many fantastic creators - female creators as well as male creators that have their own followings, their own fans, and their own books that are successful.","With 'Red Sonja', it's a single character leading a book although there's a supporting cast, whereas 'Secret Six' is basically six characters who have equal time and equal place in the book, so it's got a team dynamic that 'Red Sonja' doesn't have.","My career path is the weirdest thing. I was a hairdresser, I worked at Marvel for a few months, and then I was signed to a DC exclusive for eight years.","I love DC. I love the people there, and I am deeply in love with that universe, but it meant that for a long time, when other offers came up, I always had to turn them down.","Red Sonja, she was a hellraiser before Buffy, Xena, and Ripley even existed. When so many heroines in comics were all hung up on romance and the bizarre gender politics of comics at the time, Sonja was out cutting off the heads of dragons and pirates.","I try to make every issue new-reader friendly. I remember being frustrated many times trying to pick up new series that were overladen with baggage. The trick is to make that backstory seem like something compelling that they will want to explore rather than an obstacle course they have to crawl through to get to the story.","The fishnets on Black Canary never bothered me: they fit her character. It's the same for me with the bikini... most people don't wear a lot of clothes in these stories, and it's a big part of what makes her instantly recognizable. Do I want her in a raincoat? Not really.","Part of the joy of my career, for me, has been giving these iconic females a bit of shading of that unapologetic female vibe. I think it's an interesting approach.","I get very invested in characters; it's the only way I find that I can write a book and really make it work.","I admire writers who can remain objective and distanced, but that doesn't seem to be in my toolbox somehow. I have to care, I have to have skin in the game.","Leaving a book is hard - 'Secret Six' was a book that people cared about. Even years later, the digital sales are great; the trades and single issues are expensive and highly sought after. It was meaningful to a lot of readers, which is endlessly gratifying.","I looked out into the audience, saw dozens of faces I knew well - LGBTQ folks, mostly - all avid comics readers and superhero fans and DC supporters, and it just hit me: Why was this so impossible? Why in the world can we not do a better job of representation of not just humanity, but also our own loyal audience?","It's time for a trans hero in a mainstream comic.","When I write a team book, it's all about how they relate to each other and what they bring to the team and the book. Whether it's Black Canary and Huntress or Bane and Scandal, I look for a relationship that people can believe in, that they want to follow and learn more about.","My favorite characters are always the unpredictable ones, and with Domino, you literally never know which way the dice are going to roll.","When I think about Plastic Man, he was genuinely the first funny super hero.","First, hugely popular and talented romance/dark fantasy author Meljean Brook gives a really deep, wonderful story. She's clearly spent so much time thinking about the world of Sonja and her story in particular, it could easily have been a novel of its own.","I have had a lot of dreams come true as a writer... I've gotten to work with artists I adored as a reader; I've gotten to write characters that changed my life as a kid.","The first Knightfall story is four issues, and it is extremely focused and intense. People who have read, say, the 'Cats In the Cradle' arc in 'Secret Six' will get some idea of the primal tone of this story. It doesn't let up at all, and it ends in a new place.","Actually, the notion of what is acceptable for a moral government to do seems to have eroded in some ways since 9-11. Not to get too political here, but countries, including our own, seem to have accepted what was once almost unimaginable - condoning torture, for example, and even criminalizing peaceful protest.","When I created Mary for the 'Batgirl' issue of 'Night of the Owls,' there was a lot of excitement at DC. Scott Snyder in particular was a champion for the character, bless him.","I have never really gotten to write Catwoman. She's one of the few iconic females at DC, along with Supergirl, that I haven't really gotten to take out for a spin.","I love crossovers, I love Wonder Woman, and being able to bring the undisputed greatest warriors of the DCU and Robert E. Howard's Hyborian Age together for the very first time is a dream come true.","Batman has what is quite possibly the best rogues' gallery every created. People who have never read a comic can name half a dozen of his foes, and that's barely scratching the surface.","Wonder Woman is very much her own character. She thinks big.","People who are exposed to great Wonder Woman stories love her. You have to do your best work and get it out there so people can experience it."],"Gail Tsukiyama":["During the day, if I don't have any other commitments, I'm usually at my desk writing, revising, or researching anywhere from four to six hours.","I also find doing the mundane, everyday things in life has a calming, creative influence on me. Some of my best ideas come when I'm vacuuming or waiting in lines.","When I'm in the midst of finishing a book, I can be working around the clock."],"Gail Z. Martin":["The 370-year-old antique shop Trifles and Folly is the heart of 'Deadly Curiosities,' my new urban fantasy novel from Solaris Books.","My father loved antique shops and shows, and quite a bit of my childhood involved outings to dim, dusty places packed with cast-off treasures.","I grew up around old stuff that was not necessarily valuable, but certainly unusual.","One of the best parts of being a writer means that researching all kinds of cool stuff actually counts as work!","Getting to share the stories in my head with other people and have them enjoy those stories, and having them come to see my characters as real. That's so cool.","I always send new writers to 'Writer's Digest Books' line-up of how-to books. I read them all when I was starting out, and they were very helpful."],"Gaines Adams":["It's funny, as a little kid, you look up to those guys who you play as in 'Madden,' and now to see myself in the game, it's an honor.","I'm a four-down guy. I can rush the passer and stop the run. I know I can be a difference-maker.","You know you've made your mark when you're on the cover of a videogame.","I want to be a great player. I don't want to play for the money. I don't want to play for fame. I'd just as soon no one knew who I was. I want to play football because it's football.","Greg White got a boxer because I said I was getting one. I was talking about getting a boxer since before training camp.","Back home in South Carolina, you have a lot of little soul food restaurants you can run to and get some quick, decent food.","I like to have fun, but I also try to make time for my son.","First of all, I want to thank the Buccaneers for giving me the opportunity and for picking me in the draft. This is the nature of the beast, though, and this is a new start for me. I wish them the best of luck, and I am just glad to be a Bear.","Coach Morris wasn't too hard on me, not at all. Being drafted where I was at, there were high expectations for me. I still have high expectations for myself.","Every day I went to work at Tampa, I gave it my all.","Julius Peppers is a beast, man. I don't know how many pounds he outweighs me by... I still try to do things like him to make my game better.","I feel like by me putting on a couple more pounds will help my game tremendously. Putting on 10-15 pounds will help me stop the run better and be a more dominant pass rusher.","It really doesn't matter to me whether it's defensive end or linebacker. I just want to play the game of football. I've been working on linebacker drills since I got out to Fischer Sports in Phoenix.","I love getting after that quarterback! That's my deal: sacking the quarterback."],"Gal Gadot":["At the end of the day, Wonder Woman is a peace seeker. But when fight arrives, she can fight. She's a warrior, and she enjoys the adrenaline of the fight.","Wonder Woman, she's amazing. I love everything that she represents and everything that she stands for. She's all about love and compassion and truth and justice and equality, and she's a whole lot of woman.","What's so lovely about Wonder Woman is yes, she has the strength and power of a goddess, but she has the heart and mind of a human. So I play her as I think a woman like me would act in the situations she's going through. You treat her as a normal woman who happens to be fantastic and almighty.","I think women are amazing for being able to show what they feel. I admire women who do. I think it's a mistake when women cover their emotions to look tough. I say let's own who we are and use it as a strength.","In real life, I'm the type of girl who doesn't take herself too seriously. I'm very serious when it comes to work, but I like to make jokes and have a good laugh and make fun of myself.","A baby comes with such responsibility. Once you become a mother, you always have a guilt trip. You always try to do the best, but you feel you can always be better.","Wonder Woman is a fighter, better than most, but it's what she fights for that is important. It's her vision of a future of peace and acceptance that makes her the right ambassador for everyone.","It is so important for girls and boys to have a female, strong superhero to look up to.","I'm a genuine person - I will never promote something I don't believe in.","Let me start by saying I wish no country had the need for an army. But in Israel, serving is part of being an Israeli. You've got to give back to the state. You give two or three years, and it's not about you. You give your freedom away. You learn discipline and respect.","I feel that I've got the opportunity to set a great role model for girls to look up to a strong, active, compassionate, loving, positive woman, and I think it's so important.","I'm kind of sarcastic. Not cynical but sarcastic.","There aren't enough good roles for strong women. I wish we had more female writers. Most of the female characters you see in films today are the 'poor heartbroken girl.'","I just keep active - everything that's challenging me, everything that I feel like doing.","The Wonder Woman that you see in 'Batman v Superman' is a woman who has been around, and she's very experienced. She understands a lot about man. Whereas, in the standalone movie, we are telling the grown-up story, Diana becoming Wonder Woman, and this was a story that was never told before.","For me, it was important Wonder Woman wouldn't be a Goody Two-Shoes. She has a little bit of attitude, and when she fights, she has a smirk on her face. I didn't want her to be polished. I want people to relate to her.","For me, being an actress, my responsibility is not to pay attention to all the noise around me and to pay attention to the script and the director and protect the character and try to tell her story the best I can.","I want people to have a good impression of Israel. I don't feel like I'm an ambassador for my country, but I do talk about Israel a lot - I enjoy telling people about where I come from and my religion.","I try to eat healthy. But sometimes, though, I eat cheeseburgers. That's good for the soul. I make sure to balance everything out. I drink tons of water.","I really liked to perform. My mother always tells this story: I was five. They had a party, and they'd put me to bed. I heard everyone on the rooftop, and I went upstairs. No one paid any attention to me, so I took a hose and sprayed everyone. Very elegant, right? 'It's me! Look at me!' I loved the attention.","For me especially, I travel a lot, and with the weather change and everything, my skin gets dehydrated very fast.","I am very much in favor of women's rights, being a woman myself, and I support intelligent, successful, independent working women.","I represent the 'Wonder Woman' of the new world.","Growing up, I was a dancer. I wanted to be a choreographer.","I definitely have a strong sense of my Jewish and Israeli identity. I did my two-year military service; I was brought up in a very Jewish, Israeli family environment, so of course my heritage is very important to me.","I do cardio, but I don't like it as much. I'd rather do weights.","If things had gone according to my plans, I'd be a lawyer. I never dreamt of being an actress.","I like the lasso of truth. There is something so beautiful about the fact that people have to tell the truth when they have the lasso around them. And it's not too violent.","All my life, I've been working with male directors, which I've really enjoyed. And I'm lucky in that I've worked with men who have a lot of respect for women. But working with a woman is a different experience. It feels like the communication is different.","I've been very active all my life. I was a combat instructor in the Israeli Army.","I danced for 12 years, and I played a lot team sports: basketball, volleyball.","The good thing about being an actress is that it's very children-friendly. I can work for three months, and then I can have six months off.","I never planned on being an actress or Wonder Woman, but everything just happened, and I am grateful and happy and in love with what I do."],"Gale Anne Hurd":["I'm just attracted to the action element of science fiction. It's great to sit in the editing room with the director and sound engineers and to create the feeling where your heart is racing and you're sitting at the edge of your seat and you find yourself holding your breath.","A lot of my films have dealt with the dark side of technology and stress that you have to examine the ramifications of progress.","Filmmaking is a business and at the bottom line people who don't make fiscally responsible decisions end up going into another line of work.","A lot of producers now are people who stay in their office and never go to the set. I don't know how you can be the advocate of the movie if you're not there in it every day.","I'm a huge historical fiction and non-fiction fan.","I've always loved comic books, which is why I've done films like 'Hulk' and 'The Punishers.'","I just like the comic book sensibility. If I can turn them into films and TV series, that's just icing on the cake.","I also love the zombie genre, my zombie fandom going way back to 'Night of the Living Dead.' And 'The Walking Dead' is truly the ultimate representation of that sensibility in the comic book genre.","What's so wonderful about 'The Walking Dead' is that we're able to explore human nature in its most depraved as well as its most humanitarian in each episode.","We tend to be more environmental at home than at work, regardless of the industry we're in.","I've always been a fan of sci-fi, fantasy, and horror. I like working with larger-than-life characters in fascinating worlds - places where the rules are different."],"Gale Gordon":["The last thing in the world I should have done was go into the theater because was inordinately shy as a young man. I couldn't open my mouth. At a party, I was the one stuck up against the wall. I was embarrassed about talking. I felt that I couldn't talk well.","My voice, I have to say, is kind of miraculous because I was born with a cleft palate.","I had admired Richard Burton for years and years before I had ever worked with him. He was a great, great actor. It was a joy to get to know him as a person.","I think anybody who has been in the theater, prefers it. Television is a... factory. You turn out things on a revolving assembly line. You don't have time to perfect anything in television.","I've worked with very few that I considered unpleasant. Dennis the Menace was a joy to work on.","My wife and I love to read. We're going to have to move out to make room for the books! And we have our dogs."],"Gale Harold":["I'm more interested in the quality of the work than its medium.","You have to like your character, because if you don't, no one else will either.","You are preparing yourself for a scene, and the most important thing is to remain emotionally available and remain in the moment with your scene partner. You don't want to let your own self-consciousness block the flow of creativity that's coming out so that you can act and react, and play what the scene is all about.","If anyone can crack the publicity nut and figure out how to not come across hammy and contrived, I'd love to talk to them.","My interests are not really with television, per se.","I'm a bad interview because I want to always feel like I'm being totally honest, but at the same time, I'm absolutely paranoid. That combination results in a lot of spaces.","Some say that Jesus is the rock, or the anchor. I say that your friends and family are your anchor. And you can really hold their hands, not just sing about it. No disrespect to George Jones.","I started studying at 26. Before that, I never thought of acting as something that I would ever try.","After I began to explore what an actor actually is, I studied for three years before I had the guts to go on an audition.","My first manager, Suzanne DeWalt, saw a play I was in. She was invited by the director Joan Scheckel, who was my first real acting teacher. Joan was also good friends with my friend Susie Landau Finch, who had first encouraged me to consider acting, so that's how I began studying."],"Gale Norton":["I spend a year at the Hoover Institute at Stanford, researching market approaches to air pollution control.","I think that our cooperative conservation approaches get people to sit down and grapple with problem solving.","Local innovation and initiative can help us better understand how to protect our environment.","We have vastly increased the amount of funding that is available for conservation partnerships.","Predators make it much more difficult to find consensus. It's a lot easier to agree about birds and plants than about animals that endanger people and livestock.","Human beings are going to be relying on natural resources for a long time.","These are estimates that are done by the experts as to how much they expect we could get from the first lease sale that would take place in ANWR, and the estimate is about $2.5 billion.","We also know that China and India, as their economies ramp up, are using more and more energy.","I was a little too young to be a hippie.","The developers, if they decide to move a tortoise, have to pay the long-term costs for enhancing the areas that take care of the tortoise, and it gives us the opportunity to manage an area that is going to be protected.","Especially with the predators, one of the things that gets these programs going on a local level is for our land management agencies to build partnerships with surrounding communities and landowners.","We do have serious energy needs for the country, we are aware that natural gas is especially in demand because of its air quality benefits: 90 percent of new power plants have been natural gas-powered.","Our responsibility for BLM lands is multiple-use, meaning a variety of needs and uses.","What's near and dear to my heart is cooperative conservation.","I think the greatest challenge in environmentalism and the most rewarding challenge is trying to figure out how humans can meet their needs while protecting the environment.","Growing up in Denver, I'm sure it started with loving the Colorado mountains.","Why has it seemed that the only way to protect the environment is with heavy-handed government regulation?","I think today we recognize that economic activity needs to search for ways to protect the environment.","In Washington, there's always an effort to label people.","I started out as a Democrat.","My schedulers keep getting driven crazy by the fact that they can't fit hikes in my schedule."],"Gale Sayers":["Our young people look up to us.

You have Ray Guy, Jim Plunkett, Lester Hayes and Donnie Shell.","I had a career that was very short, but it had a lot of thrills.","There are some people that probably should be in the Hall of Fame, but they're not for some reason.","I was playing in the league when Ray Guy was playing in the league. He was the best kicker I've ever seen. He could bullet that ball 70 yards.","What happens also is that a lot of those people and reporters who vote for Hall of Famers, some of the people who were around when Ray Guy was around, are deceased. And some of the reporters don't remember Ray Guy. He should have been in the Hall of Fame 15 years ago."],"Galeazzo Ciano":["Victory has a hundred fathers but defeat is an orphan.","The German decision to fight is implacable. Even if they were given more than they ask, they would attack just the same, because they are possessed by the demon of destruction."],"Galen Rowell":["A lot of people think that when you have grand scenery, such as you have in Yosemite, that photography must be easy.","One of the biggest mistakes a photographer can make is to look at the real world and cling to the vain hope that next time his film will somehow bear a closer resemblance to it.","My mountaineering skills are not important to my best photographs, but they do add a component to my work that is definitely a bit different than that of most photographers.","When we tune in to an especially human way of viewing the landscape powerfully, it resonates with an audience.","I began to realise that film sees the world differently than the human eye, and that sometimes those differences can make a photograph more powerful than what you actually observed.","I began taking pictures in the natural world to be able to show people what I was experiencing when I climbed and explored in Yosemite in the High Sierra.","There is no question that photography has played a major role in the environmental movement.","I find it some of the hardest photography and the most challenging photography I've ever done. It's a real challenge to work with the natural features and the natural light.","I almost never set out to photograph a landscape, nor do I think of my camera as a means of recording a mountain or an animal unless I absolutely need a 'record shot'. My first thought is always of light.","Wanting to take a light camera with me when I climb or do mountain runs has kept me using exclusively 35 mm.","I think that cognitive scientists would support the view that our visual system does not directly represent what is out there in the world and that our brain constructs a lot of the imagery that we believe we are seeing.","The landscape is like being there with a powerful personality and I'm searching for just the right angles to make that portrait come across as meaningfully as possible.","There's no question that photographs communicate more instantly and powerfully than words do, but if you want to communicate a complex concept clearly, you need words, too.","My first thought is always of light.","I remember when an editor at the National Geographic promised to run about a dozen of my landscape pictures from a story on the John Muir trail as an essay, but when the group of editors got together, someone said that my pictures looked like postcards.","These days, most nature photographers are deeply committed to the environmental message.","What I mean by photographing as a participant rather than observer is that I'm not only involved directly with some of the activities that I photograph, such as mountain climbing, but even when I'm not I have the philosophy that my mind and body are part of the natural world.","I'm exchanging molecules every 30 days with the natural world and in a spiritual sense I know I am a part of it and take my photographs from that emotional feeling within me, rather than from an emotional distance as a spectator.","I think landscape photography in general is somewhat undervalued.","Luckily, many other people tell me how they have had a particular landscape photograph of mine in their office or bedroom for 15 years and it always speaks to them strongly whenever they see it.","The combination of pictures and words together can be really effective, and I began to realise in my career that unless I wrote my own words, then my message was diluted.","The reason that I keep writing is that all my most powerful messages about the fates of wild places that I care about need to have words as well as images.","Ever since the 1860s when photographers travelled the American West and brought photographs of scenic wonders back to the people on the East Coast of America we have had a North American tradition of landscape photography used for the environment.","Today, I'm very careful not to mention very specific locations when I write or give captions.","And most of my early pictures failed but about one in a 100 somehow looked better than what I saw.","I like to feel that all my best photographs had strong personal visions and that a photograph that doesn't have a personal vision or doesn't communicate emotion fails.","If we limit our vision to the real world, we will forever be fighting on the minus side of things, working only too make our photographs equal to what we see out there, but no better."],"Galen Weston":["Weston Bakeries is proud to support local children's charities across Canada.

Who would dare assert that we know all there is to be known?","It is surely harmful to souls to make it a heresy to believe what is proved.","Facts which at first seem improbable will, even on scant explanation, drop the cloak which has hidden them and stand forth in naked and simple beauty.","I think that in the discussion of natural problems we ought to begin not with the Scriptures, but with experiments, and demonstrations.","It vexes me when they would constrain science by the authority of the Scriptures, and yet do not consider themselves bound to answer reason and experiment.","In questions of science, the authority of a thousand is not worth the humble reasoning of a single individual.","The nature of the human mind is such that unless it is stimulated by images of things acting upon it from without, all remembrance of them passes easily away.","We must say that there are as many squares as there are numbers.","Nature is relentless and unchangeable, and it is indifferent as to whether its hidden reasons and actions are understandable to man or not.","I notice that young men go to the universities in order to become doctors or philosophers or anything, so long as it is a title, and that many go in for those professions who are utterly unfit for them, while others who would be very competent are prevented by business or their daily cares, which keep them away from letters.","He who looks the higher is the more highly distinguished, and turning over the great book of nature (which is the proper object of philosophy) is the way to elevate one's gaze."],"Galina Vishnevskaya":["The major newspapers simply stopped writing about me, and my voice could no longer be heard on radio or television.","Wanting to be understood by an audience that didn't know Russian, I tried to paint musical pictures by emphasizing the phrasing, using voice color more boldly, and varying the shade and nuance.","The friendship of Shostakovich cast a brilliant light over my whole life and whose spiritual qualities captured my soul once and for all time."],"Gallagher":["Detroit is drunken idiots.

I hate grass. I'm horrible.'","With time, I've got more used to grass, and I think my style of game helps.","It's a great thing to have: that pressure everywhere you go, that responsibility. I think it's good to have it.","I used to either lose in my first or second match or I would go very far in the tournament. So I've been saying to myself, 'Come on, you've got to get through these first two matches. They're very tough. Because afterwards you feel different.' So I'm really putting my energy into getting through to those later rounds.","For us, the Grand Slams are very important. When the Grand Slams come, you're thinking, 'OK, this is the tournament.' To lose there is disappointing.","I just think I play better in the greater scenarios. I just get motivated. I like the big crowds on the centre courts.","I don't want to retire before the tournament starts for me.","It doesn't always work out that you win a tournament and then a Grand Slam, but I'm happy to have the confidence.","Obviously every time I go to a Grand Slam, I'm super excited.","It's like if you have a bad day and you don't change your mindset, even if you go to buy bread at the supermarket, like, everything is so bad. It happens. I'm very negative. You have to change it.","I'm used to putting so many things aside to be able to compete.","That's my every day: putting things aside and going out there and have two hours of concentration of tennis.","I just make sure that people around me are fine. There is not a lot I can do anymore. Just support the people. Be with them. But at the end, I've got to go play. And after, we can talk again. But I have to kind of block it for two hours."],"Garcelle Beauvais":["It only took one text message to change my life. That's when I discovered my loving husband had been unfaithful. His infidelities ended our marriage.","My parents split up when I was 3 years old, and I lived with my mother.","Conversations between parents and kids are important - about race issues, about all kinds of things, about heritage.","Adultery is the ultimate deal-breaker for me. I would rather be alone than in a relationship that doesn't honor me.","Divorce isn't one-sided, and I am by no means perfect. Becoming accountable for my role in the relationship was very empowering."],"Gardner Dozois":["What science fiction does is take what might be possible someday and examine what might happen if it were - the drawbacks and the positive things.","An experienced slush-pile reader doesn't need more than a few seconds to see if a story has potential. You don't need to eat all of a rotten egg to determine that it's rotten.","Philadelphia's a good science-fiction town. There are many professional writers here, like Michael Swanwick, Tom Purdom, Gregory Frost, Victoria McManus and others. There are professional artists such as Bob Walters and Tess Kissinger and Susan McAninley.","Even after all these years, finding a really first-rate story is still a thrill, one I want to share with others.","When I first started editing a 'Year's Best' volume in the '70s, the job was pretty straightforward - there were three or four monthly magazines to read and a few original anthologies from trade publishers every year.","I've probably read more bad science fiction than anyone else alive. But I've also read more good science fiction than anyone else alive.","When I was a boy in Salem, Mass., in the 1950s, if you wanted to buy a book, you had to take a train to Boston. And when you got there, to a bookstore, there was no such thing as a science-fiction section."],"Garet Garrett":["The New Deal was going to redistribute the national income according to ideals of social and economic justice.","There was endless controversy as to whether the acts of the New Deal did actually move recovery or retard it, and nothing final could ever come of that bitter debate because it is forever impossible to prove what might have happened in place of what did.","To the revolutionary mind the American vista must have been almost as incredible as Genghis Khan's first view of China - so rich, so soft, so unaware.","Formerly government was the responsibility of people; now people were the responsibility of government.","Revolution in the modern case is no longer an uncouth business.","Lenin, the greatest theorist of them all, did not know what he was going to do after he had got the power.","Loyalty of the law-making power to the executive power was one of the dangers the political fathers foretold.","Is it security you want? There is no security at the top of the world.","You do not defend a world that is already lost.","Business is in itself a power.","Well, where there is freedom doubt itself must be free.","It is the function of the President, representing the executive principle, to execute the laws.","The New Deal's enmity for that system of free and competitive private enterprise which we call capitalism was fundamental.","This is the problem for which revolutionary theory has yet to find the right solution, if there is one. The difficulty is that the economic interests of the two classes are antagonistic.","The spectacle of a great, solvent government paying a fictitious price for gold it did not want and did not need and doing it on purpose to debase the value of its own paper currency was one to astonish the world.","If the great Government of the United States were a private corporation no bank would take its name on a piece of paper, because it has cynically repudiated the words engraved upon its bonds.","If you put a ten dollar bill under the rug instead of spending it, that is capital formation. It represents ten dollars' worth of something that might have been immediately consumed, but wasn't."],"Gareth Bale":["When I was younger, I had some close friends who always loved European football, and Real Madrid at that time were the dominant force. I remember family holidays when we used to go to Spain, and we'd bring back replica shirts of Real Madrid and pretend to be the players when we played in the park.","I always believed in my ability, but I think in any sport you need that little bit of luck.","As a kid, you obviously dream of being a professional footballer. I would watch players like Ronaldo of Brazil and pretend to be him in the playground. But I don't think about trying to become one of the best in the world or anything like that. I just play football.","There seems to be this thing in football where everything has to be... now!","Whenever I get days off, I go home, or friends and family come up. I'm in contact with them every day, so it's like we live next door, but obviously we live in two different countries. Football is my job, and everyone around me has given me the opportunity to purely concentrate on football, and everyone else worries about everything else.","I'm a proud Welshman.","I don't go out, so I don't get attention from girls. They're not going to have posters of me on their walls. I just try to get on with my life.","I was never too much into school. I liked lunchtimes and breaks, but nah, I hated sitting at a desk. I was always looking out of the window, looking at my watch, thinking about when I could play football.","My dad's the one who's always been there; he's my hero, you could say. Even when he was working, he'd do anything for me. He's been the biggest influence in my life.","I think La Liga is the best league in the world.","I play computer games, watch TV and do what normal people do.","I've certainly not got any famous people's numbers on my phone. It's just not my thing, really.","The most important thing is to not waste your money.","I'd say that Spanish football is probably the best I've seen.","When you play in the Premier League, say you're playing against a lower-end team, they set up to defend all the time, they set up to block you off. But when you play in the Champions League, all the other teams are used to winning every week, so it's more of an open game, it's more attacking, end-to-end.","I probably prefer Spanish football to the others. It's very technical, the way they play; they keep the ball well, and whenever Spurs have played against Spanish teams in the past, they've always made it difficult for us.","Between 12 and 14, I shot up a ridiculous amount. The muscles were struggling to stretch and grow at the rate my bones were growing. It gave me problems with my back and my hamstrings.","I'm ambitious, I want to play in the Champions League, and that's the aim with Tottenham - to start qualifying for the Champions League on a consistent basis."],"Gareth Gates":["I like to have quiet evenings and relax.","I live for my daughter. Every decision I make is about her and for her. It's great. She's perfect.","I love musical theatre because I love doing a live performance eight times a week.","I had a meal in Pizza Hut and the waitress told me I didn't need to pay. So I decided to be a bit cheeky and ask for more pizza and garlic bread.","If I get a bad review, I don't take it personally because everyone is entitled to their opinion.","Before all this happened, I always used to see my stammer as being a negative, all my life, but then when I went on 'Pop Idol,' and the first time I saw it on television, it was really, really bad, but also it made me stand out; it made people remember me. So for the first time in my life, it worked to my advantage.","Having my first number one single and being able to travel to places I've never been before has been amazing. The tour was also fantastic. There are so many things which I've experienced this year which I never even dreamed of.","I do find my speech difficult at times, but it's getting so much better as my confidence grows and that's thanks to the position I'm now in, which is totally due to my fans.","I've got my feet firmly on the ground, I can't see life changing too much. I reckon more girls will talk to me at college and more people will look at me, but they know me for who I am.","The last thing I wanted was to be with someone who's the same age as me and wanted the limelight, wanted the attention. There's lots of girls out there who do.","I always wanted to be with a woman who has the same mindset and wants to look after me like my mum.","Because I see my mum and dad as such amazing friends, I think I'll be a really good dad.","No one knows for sure if you can inherit a stammer, and so I worry that my baby might. It's why I want to work on my speech before he arrives. I don't want him to hear me stammer.","I haven't been the best boyfriend or husband, and that means I don't get to spend every day with my daughter.","I was terrible when I first started skating and was clinging onto the side for dear life, but it's something I'll always have now, and the tour is always so much fun.","I'm very driven, and I always have been. So I'd like to release a successful album, continue in musical theatre, and be more involved in business.","Musical theatre is something that I always wanted to be a part of, and my first ever role on the West End as Joseph in 'Joseph And The Technicolor Dreamcoat' gave me a taste for it.","I'm part of a speech therapy programme called the McGuire Programme. It teaches you a new way to breathe, a new way to speak, a brand new way of tackling the mind-sets that come with having a speech impediment. Mainly, it teaches you how to slow things down, and that has really helped me.","In the music business, I found it was much more about interviews, photo shoots and appearances rather than actual performing, which I do best.","My speech is really important to me, but the thing is at the moment it can't be more important than my singing. Until I'm an established name all over the world, my speech won't be more important than my music.","At the age of 13, I felt it was up to me to decide whether I wanted to go to church or be with my mates, and I chose to go to church.","I'm part of a speech therapy course called the Maguire Programme. It isn't a cure; it's something you need to maintain and work on. I get days where I find things more difficult than others.","Breathing is fundamental to speech. A stammer is caused by erratic airflow, so if you have a smooth airflow, you have smooth speech.","On the McGuire course, there's a technique called 'cancellation' where negative experiences are replaced with positive ones.","Finally having the freedom to speak is a really liberating feeling.","The moment an athlete doesn't train, things start to get a bit rusty.","Speech and having a stammer is obviously a big part of my life.","Sharing the stage while singing my songs was a bit of a daunting prospect.","I'm not closing the door on my solo career, but with 5th Story, if the public demand is there, then I'll continue to work with the band. If not, we'll all go our separate ways again.","I really love it in Belfast. I always stay in the most bombed hotel, the Europa!","I was always used to being centre stage - something that had its good and bad points.","As you know, I was a solo singer, something I just got very much used to. Turns out I'm quite enjoying being in a band!","I've stammered all my life, and it's fair to say that my stammer has shaped my life. It's made me make some decisions that I'm sure I wouldn't have if I didn't suffer with this affliction.","Living with a stammer is difficult. It's a daily uphill struggle with emotional baggage weighing you down. You can't be the person you want to be.","Young adults living with a stutter is hard work. How do they handle job interviews? What do they do when the phone rings? How do they 'chat someone up'? All these things the average person takes for granted prove to be a stammerer's biggest challenge."],"Garik Israelian":["The one way to discover about aliens is to tune your radio telescope and listen to the signals.","Connection between life and radioactive nuclei is straightforward. No life without tectonic activity, without volcanic activity. And we know very well that geothermal energy is mostly produced by decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium.","When discs form around stars, there is interaction of angular momentum between disc, planets and parent star, and this interaction affects the rotation of the parent star, and that will affect the lithium abundance.","Let me mention that not all sun-like stars host planets - perhaps about 30% of them are planet-builders. It's not so easy to form a planet!","There are many unidentified bands in the spectra of stars. Wide bands are produced by some complex molecules in the interstellar space.","I have no doubt that Brian May would have had a brilliant career in science had he completed his Ph.D. in 1971.","Spectroscopy can probably answer the question, 'Is there anybody out there?' Are we alone?","It's not very fun to do spectroscopy."],"Garret Dillahunt":["I did the whole rock and roll thing that's coming up. I think you're going to enjoy that! 'Burt Rocks', it's called. I like that he's a dreamer; I like how positive he is. There's a lot of things I think I can learn from Burt.","I think I have music in me! I had a scholarship to study singing at one point, and I've never really done anything about it. I've done some music on stage, but it's been a long time. It would be kind of fun.","But the fact that same-sex marriage is still an issue is insane. Thinking love knows a sex is ridiculous.","I've long been a fan of Chiwetel Ejiofor. I think he's a great actor. He's my kind of guy. He does what I aspire to do.","I just like a good story. I want the story to be good and I want the character to be different than the last one I played. That's not always possible, but that's what I want.","If it's a good story, then everybody is trying to tell it, everybody is better for it, and it's just more fun.","I've always liked stories. I'm always reading, ever since I was a kid. I've always been reading and wanting to be in some other world.","It's kind of my whole philosophy as an actor. I think that's what we're supposed to do is play a wide range of characters - or it's just what I like to do, I should say. I like to try to be as different as I can from one thing to the next.","Everyone thinks their family is the craziest family in the world. Like, 'My God, my family's crazy!'","I have such a crush on Shirley Manson. I think she's the coolest thing.","I love a good fight and I think a bad fight can ruin a movie. I really do.","You'll see a lot more blood in 'Saw' movies or something like that than you will in either of the 'Last House' movies. I kind of think it owes more to 'The Virgin Spring' which is the original source material, the Bergman movie.","I actually started in comedy, but then after 'Deadwood' I started concentrating on the dramas more. But then I just got tired for raping and killing and figured, 'It's time to do another comedy.'","I have been really lucky in my career, with the diversity of it. I get to play really complex people.","Well, one of my favorite ones to work on - besides just about any scene from 'Deadwood' - was my scene with Brad Pitt in 'Assassination of Jesse James'. That was just a fun day.","The other day, someone called me this generation's Bruce Dern - I'd never thought of that, and frankly, I don't know enough of Bruce Dern's work to comment on it, though he is an incredible actor.","In the past, if you did film, you couldn't do stage, and if you did film, you certainly didn't do television. You had to pick what you wanted to be. Now it seems like we can bounce around, not only between genres, but between mediums, and I like that. I like change and I like a good story.","Yeah, I like to have fun - I think that's a good way to live. I think you're better at your job if you like it.","I'm an ensemble guy, I guess - that comes from the theater. If I ever won some kind of award someday, I imagine I'd try to be very gracious, but in the end, I just want to keep working. I don't see why that, if you just put your mind to it and keep sowing the right seeds, you can't keep doing the things you want to do.","No one has a name in 'The Road.' Like Cormac McCarthy's novel from which it's adapted, 'The Road' features characters such as the man, the boy, the wife, the old man and the veteran.","As a heterosexual man, I've never really doubted my sexuality, but I've had men in my life and thought, 'If I was gay, I'd be with him' - you know?","Brad Pitt is a dude who just wants to make good movies. He's not afraid to surround himself with the greatest actors, which I always appreciate because I've also seen actors who only want to surround themselves with weak actors because it makes them look better. That ends up making a poorer movie."],"Garrett Camp":["I definitely see a correlation between how many things a company gets right and how fast a company grows.","Every time I make a mistake with a company, I write it out and try to figure out why it happened.","I'm interested in sites that help people find information and filter what's available. The Internet is so big that no one can stay on top of everything.","Facebook is made up of people you've met, but not necessarily who are similar to you. I have 850 'friends,' and a lot are acquaintances, not friends. I don't really know them. If I've met someone one time, how should they be influencing my feed?","If you know what you want, you use Google. But if you don't know what you want, and you want to be surprised and find something you didn't expect, we want you come to StumbleUpon. Really, that idea of being a discovery engine versus a search engine.","If the founders of a start-up are considering selling it, I'd advise them to consider the synergies. Could the buyer give you access to something you don't have now, like a certain technology? Would it make your life easier? Are you looking for a change? Things will change, so you have to be ready for that.","If I had it to do over, I might have finished school first, then devoted all my time to StumbleUpon instead of dividing my time between the two. In the end, however, it was probably good to take the time I did.","I like to say StumbleUpon provides a personal tour of the Internet. The responses are more targeted to your interests than they would be with a regular search engine. If you choose a topic on our site that you're interested in, such as art, Web sites related to art appear, as if you're leafing through an art magazine.","I have 250 contacts, employees, and investors who, anytime they come across something relevant, will share it with me. I wake up to 10-15 links that people have explicitly recommended for me. I don't have to look for news anymore; it flows to me.","The way the Facebook network is set up, it's not as suitable for content discovery. Twitter is better, but there are too many over-sharers. Also, on Twitter and Facebook, everything comes from people you know. On StumbleUpon, it comes from people that you don't necessarily know but share your interests.","If you don't find a new website when you Stumble, we've failed.","A lot of productivity is capturing ideas. I use a wiki - it's more valuable than e-mail for running a company - and I have a page for every person with whom I interact frequently.","The bigger a company gets, the more people are involved in decisions, the slower decisions get made. Look, the whole theory of startups is that three motivated people can go and do something that every company can't."],"Garrett Clayton":["Entitled people drive me insane. The world owes you nothing! Get over it!","I started dancing when I was about 15 or 16 in my high school drama club, and then I liked it so much that they offered dual enrollment classes. So my senior year, I ended up taking college dance courses while I was in high school because I had good grades.","We all fall in love with someone for the person they are - not because of their race, their hair, or any of the frivolous things that go away in time.","I don't really like talking about my personal life. I like a certain amount of veil.","I haven't been brought down because people are focused on who I'm dating, what I'm eating, or what handbag is the best handbag - that's so cheap to me. But if others want to open up about their personal lives, that is their choice. It's not for me to judge.","I love doing the dishes... not for the act of cleaning but because I get to put my headphones in, listen to music, and ignore the world for an hour, and it's totally acceptable because I'm cleaning.","After I started being able to grow a beard, I was obviously done at Disney - until I'm old enough to be a parent or an annoying older brother.","I'm a hot mess when it comes to any physical activity. My body just pours sweat. Not a lot of people know, but I always have my trusty inhaler with me. When I start to have even a little bit of an asthma attack, I just start dripping sweat. It's my body's emergency system.","I was trying to be someone for the first part of high school. I was kind of this nerdy kid who didn't want to be a nerd anymore. Even talking about it, I'm embarrassed. I'm like, 'Ugh, why did you care what people thought?'","There's all these idealistic things that TV and movies tell you that you should want to be. And when you're growing up, you find out what you really care about and what really matters.","By the time I got to set for 'Cobra,' I think I'd lost about 28 pounds in about a month and a half. I didn't want to look back and be like, 'Wow, someone should stop eating PB and J's.' Like, if I'm going to look back when I'm 80, I wanted to be like, 'Wow, okay, I looked pretty fit. I used my youth right.'","I really bonded with my mom, growing up, through our love of horror movies!","I don't talk about how old I am because sometimes it can affect parts that you get in Hollywood. I don't believe that it's a necessary element. I feel that I'm a character, and I'm an actor. People focusing on my age instead of the role I'm playing can be a hindrance.","I was a kid who had asthma and bifocals and wore sweater vests."],"Garrett Dillahunt":["I think that's how most families are, really. Everyone thinks their family is the craziest family in the world.","I just like a good story. I want the story to be good, and I want the character to be different than the last one I played. That's not always possible, but that's what I want.","I've always liked stories. I'm always reading, ever since I was a kid. I've always been reading and wanting to be in some other world. This is the perfect job for me.","I want to be different and have a good story. If it's a good story, then everybody is trying to tell it, everybody is better for it, and it's just more fun.","I'm drawn to melancholy characters. I don't know what that says about me. Characters who are filled with shame. I think shame is interesting.","I'm one of the regulars. I play this doctor, Dr. Andrew Brown, going through some marriage problems.","I don't know what's with me and the 'of God' shows. It's hard to tweet about, because I guess 'God' triggers some kind of filter.","Mindy is just one of those people... she's just got a hell of a life going for herself. She's just really interesting and interested in the world and the larger things.","Ty Walker doesn't wear suits very much. He's not used to being that pressed and conservative businessman. So, he's self-conscious anyway about walking around in these skinny-legged suits, and then for someone to sort of assume that's who he is, it really bothers him.","I think that's what we're supposed to do is play a wide range of characters - or it's just what I like to do, I should say.","I remember being described often as 'the horrifically ugly Jack McCall,' and I kept thinking it took me about 10 seconds to get like that."],"Garrett Fort":["The strength of the vampire is that people will not believe in him.","Superstition? Who can define the boundary line between the superstition of yesterday and the scientific fact of tomorrow?","To die, to be really dead, that must be glorious. There are far worse things awaiting man than death.","God will not damn a lunatic's soul. He knows that the powers of evil are too great for those of us with weak minds."],"Garrett Graff":["I think, though, that people will read into a reporter's story a bias that they want to see in a reporter.","The influence of blogging is overall a very positive force in the media."],"Garrett Hardin":["A finite world can support only a finite population; therefore, population growth must eventually equal zero.","Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own best interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons.","But as population became denser, the natural chemical and biological recycling processes became overloaded, calling for a redefinition of property rights.","A technical solution may be defined as one that requires a change only in the techniques of the natural sciences, demanding little or nothing in the way of change in human values or ideas of morality.","The social arrangements that produce responsibility are arrangements that create coercion, of some sort.","No one should be able to enter a wilderness by mechanical means.","Why are ecologists and environmentalists so feared and hated? This is because in part what they have to say is new to the general public, and the new is always alarming.","An attack on values is inevitably seen as an act of subversion.","Education can counteract the natural tendency to do the wrong thing, but the inexorable succession of generations requires that the basis for this knowledge be constantly refreshed.","Using the commons as a cesspool does not harm the general public under frontier conditions, because there is no public, the same behavior in a metropolis is unbearable.","Fundamentalists are panicked by the apparent disintegration of the family, the disappearance of certainty and the decay of morality. Fear leads them to ask, if we cannot trust the Bible, what can we trust?","The only kind of coercion I recommend is mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon by the majority of the people affected.","You cannot do only one thing.","Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all.","But it is no good using the tongs of reason to pull the Fundamentalists' chestnuts out of the fire of contradiction. Their real troubles lie elsewhere.","Moreover, the practical recommendations deduced from ecological principles threaten the vested interests of commerce; it is hardly surprising that the financial and political power created by these investments should be used sometimes to suppress environmental impact studies.","However, I think the major opposition to ecology has deeper roots than mere economics; ecology threatens widely held values so fundamental that they must be called religious.","A coldly rationalist individualist can deny that he has any obligation to make sacrifices for the future.","Continuity is at the heart of conservatism: ecology serves that heart.","In a finite world this means that the per capita share of the world's goods must steadily decrease.","The optimum population is, then, less than the maximum.","Incommensurables cannot be compared.","Of course, a positive growth rate might be taken as evidence that a population is below its optimum.","In an approximate way, the logic of commons has been understood for a long time, perhaps since the discovery of agriculture or the invention of private property in real estate.","The rational man finds that his share of the cost of the wastes he discharges into the commons is less than the cost of purifying his wastes before releasing them.","Indeed, our particular concept of private property, which deters us from exhausting the positive resources of the earth, favors pollution.","The Universal Declaration of Human Rights describes the family as the natural and fundamental unit of society. It follows that any choice and decision with regard to the size of the family must irrevocably rest with the family itself, and cannot be made by anyone else.","It is a mistake to think that we can control the breeding of mankind in the long run by an appeal to conscience.","To say that we mutually agree to coercion is not to say that we are required to enjoy it, or even to pretend we enjoy it."],"Garrett Hedlund":["See, the 'On the Road' that came out in 1957 was censored. A lot of the honesty of it, the bitter honesty, is in the original scroll version that came out in 2007 on the 50-year anniversary. Back then, there was so much post-Second World War fear that was imposed on everybody - 'You must live life this way' - and these guys were bored.","I've been told I'm too good looking for certain roles, but that's okay, it just motivates me to go deeper.","I'm not good at chatting right away. Women have to be very patient with me, I suppose.","I remember driving the tractor on our farm, and Tim McGraw would be on the radio. I'd find myself walking out of class, singing his songs. And then Tim ended up playing my father in 'Friday Night Lights.' It was surreal.","It's funny, though, speaking of fathers and sons, because me and John Goodman played father and son, like, five or six years ago in the film 'Death Sentence,' and I got back with him again in 'Inside Llewyn Davis.'","You might think the thinner version of yourself is going to be the most positive or confident, but that's not how it is for me. When I'm over 200 pounds, that's when I'm the most confident version of myself.","I grew up on a farm in a small town where you do or say one thing and everybody knows about it. You see it happen, there's always the town gossip - 'Oh did you hear about so and so, or did you hear what went on in this household?' So I learned at a very young age just to keep my mouth shut.","When you come across someone colorful and vibrant maybe in the present it isn't so interesting, but, in the past, it sheds a wonderful light onto living life.","I had to jump on the tractor and do my chores. I would have just killed to be in town, to be able to Rollerblade hand-in-hand with somebody I had a crush on. I just wanted to get off the farm, to find my outlet.","It's funny - I read that women look to chiseled-faced guys for one-night stands, and to round-faced guys for marriage. When I'm rounder in the face, I like to say, 'This is my long-term look.' Or 'This is my wife-and-kids look right here.'","I've always had a longstanding dream, ever since I was a kid, where I was running on a big lake of ice and I kept running and kept running, just about to where I was trying to get to, and I fell through the ice, and then I couldn't find the hole where I fell through to get back out again.","A great amount of good is always evened out by a great amount of bad. I find it's best to acknowledge that weird balance.","I spill it out as fast as I can. I don't really edit. In Brazil, recently, I wrote 70 pages. In London, 80 pages.","When I read the 'Country Strong' script, I thought, 'Can't they just hand-double it? Can't I just do the rest of the movie and not have to do the performing?' It took me six months to learn to sing and play guitar at the same time.","Growing up, I would watch a movie on video and would go to the back of the VHS and locate the address for Universal Pictures or MGM or whatever. I'd write to the studios asking them if I could be in a movie. They never wrote me back.","When my senior prom was happening, I was in Malta filming 'Troy.'","I had never heard much about Nashville before coming out here, and that's why it's so surprising, because I'm the biggest enthusiast on the city of Nashville now. I'm looking for a place out here to live.","For me, and this may not be everybody, but because I do love country music so much, there's such a feeling of home in Nashville, especially because it's such a small town. You bring up one song, everybody knows who wrote it, everybody knows their mother and what their cell number is, and all of the stories.","The school I went to was a little farm school in Wannaska, student body 61 or something. There was a kid, the only black kid in our county, Dustin Byfuglien. He won the Stanley Cup a couple years back with the Blackhawks. Out of a class of 21 kids, he and I always had to be on opposite teams on everything because we were the most athletic.","After school, I'd hang out at the Borders bookstore until it closed.","I was into punk rock back when I was in high school. I used to go around to dive venues and take photographs. But now it's been just much more about the country stuff and soulful folk.","It's funny that I got to do 'On the Road' because the thing that had the biggest impact on me growing up was reading books. I was very inspired by the book and this spirit of Dean Moriarty and how envious we all are of somebody who can be that carefree.","I actually signed on to do 'On the Road' before we started on 'Tron,' but we were in flux for a while, just sort of playing the waiting game, trying to get the right budget and the right cast.","My biggest thing has always been privacy. With an interview such as this where the questions are about me, I struggle to express myself. I have an immediate answer in my head of what I'd say, but sometimes I feel that it would be too honest. So these wheels of censorship start going around my head.","'Love Don't Let Me Down,' which is the original title of 'Country Strong,' was just as difficult emotionally as 'Tron' was physically. I play a country singer that basically gets on tour with Gwyneth Paltrow's character, who is one of the biggest country stars out there, and she's fallen down too many times and it's an intense emotional story.","Life's too short when you find yourself sitting in a car for four hours every day trying to get from East L.A. to West L.A. to Hollywood and then back to East L.A.","Especially for me, growing up in such a small town in the middle of nowhere, the desire to be away was incredible. I wanted to see new lands, meet new people from the city, and meet people that were in much less fortunate situations than I was, so that I could be more appreciative of my present. At least I had food on the table.","I've always romanticized the late '40s and '50s - the cars, jazz, the open roads and lack of pollution. Now there are more vehicles, less hitchhikers, more billboards and power lines and stuff. People wrote wonderful long letters that took months to receive, and now everything is email.","Anybody that wants to walk out that door and leave home for a few months and rely on themselves instead of fate might have some interesting stories to tell.","I remember telling my creative writing teacher that you never want to have a journal, because if you lose it, then someone's going to know all your secrets. And then she stopped using a journal, but I always write everything down... Anytime I travel, I try and fill up notepads.","I fantasised about F. Scott Fitzgerald's 'The Great Gatsby' - I loved it, and then I read everything J. D. Salinger had to offer. Then I was turned on to Kerouac, and his spontaneous prose, his stream of consciousness way of writing. I admired him so much, and I romanticised so much about the '40s and '50s.","I used to be sick of the backroads of Minnesota. I had to drive 30 miles to get home every day, take the schoolbus for two hours. But to drive through America and see the backroads, from Nashville to Memphis, Lovick to New Mexico, was incredible. It was probably the greatest trip of my life.","The Beat Generation - that term is even more familiar now, even more than say the '70s. Hype is built and established and people link it back to a certain generation, in this case the '40s and '50s. Now everyone knows that that group was the Beat Generation.","In the present time you don't really establish what you're going through, but after time it's declared something. Right now there could be some writers doing something expressing their thoughts in a whole different style that we're not aware of. This could be the 'in-between the notes generation.'","I grew up on a farm where we had one radio station and it was all country.","It was close to like a 67- or 70-day shoot for 'Tron' on stage, in the suit. You can't even sit down during the day because of all the cables that divide the foam rubber and all the electrical circuits. We had these stools that were tall with a bicycle seat on them and you're just looking at a blue screen all day.","I was a 'Duck Hunt' and 'Mario' guy, and stuff like that. I was never technologically driven. I never had all the cool, new toys. I was the youngest child, I wasn't the only child, so I wasn't spoiled as a kid. And, we were on the farm, so we didn't have a lot. Also, with computers, I'm not very good with them. I just check my email.","With 'Tron,' we had so many crew members around and a stage full of special effects people that know exactly what has to be done in the situations. You're on a stage in sets the whole time.","Just personally, I've been attached to 'On the Road' since 2007 and it was the greatest thing in my life when I got cast in it. I couldn't believe it. When I was 17 and read the book, I looked it up on IMDb and it said that Francis Ford Coppola was going to direct it.","Kerouac was the cowboy that inspired the whole Beat Generation, and highlighted and put the spotlight on all of these minds that didn't really know what they were doing at the time, but accomplished something much bigger than what they ever foresaw.","I had done chorus before in school, but I was only trying for an easy A. I was a bass going 'dum dum da doo wop.'","Nashville is a lot like my hometown. You learn so quickly once someone hears something about you or sees something, everybody talks about it at dinner. They know your business, so people tend to be more private and not to throw themselves into everyone's faces."],"Garrett Morris":["I happen to dig being able to use whatever mystique I have to further the idea of peace."],"Garrett Neff":["I love sailing but hate cruise ships.","I think the most important element of a power outfit is proper fit. The one item to focus on is a suit. If it's the right fit, you could wear it with a T-shirt and still convey the positive message.","In 2005, I had one more year of college left, and I was taking a summer class in Barbados. I got discovered in the airport on my way back and started modeling at the beginning of my senior year at Bucknell.","I like to run a lot. I play tennis, and I like doing outdoorsy stuff - fishing, canoeing.","I work out six days a week. Usually 45 minutes of running, then swimming and weightlifting.","Some of my college friends used to laugh at me. But no one's laughing anymore. Now, they all try to get free underwear."],"Garrison Keillor":["Thank you, God, for this good life and forgive us if we do not love it enough.","Cats are intended to teach us that not everything in nature has a function.","A book is a gift you can open again and again.","The father of a daughter is nothing but a high-class hostage. A father turns a stony face to his sons, berates them, shakes his antlers, paws the ground, snorts, runs them off into the underbrush, but when his daughter puts her arm over his shoulder and says, 'Daddy, I need to ask you something,' he is a pat of butter in a hot frying pan.","Welcome to Lake Wobegon, where all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average.","Thank you, dear God, for this good life and forgive us if we do not love it enough. Thank you for the rain. And for the chance to wake up in three hours and go fishing: I thank you for that now, because I won't feel so thankful then.","A girl in a bikini is like having a loaded pistol on your coffee table - There's nothing wrong with them, but it's hard to stop thinking about it.","The funniest line in English is 'Get it?' When you say that, everyone chortles.","The reason to retire is to try to avoid embarrassment; you ought to do it before people are dropping big hints. You want to be the first to come up with the idea. You don't want to wait until you trip and fall off the stage.","It was luxuries like air conditioning that brought down the Roman Empire. With air conditioning their windows were shut, they couldn't hear the barbarians coming.","Some luck lies in not getting what you thought you wanted but getting what you have, which once you have got it you may be smart enough to see is what you would have wanted had you known.","Cursing is highly effective in person - someone kicks his car in rage, forgetting he's wearing flip-flops, flames pour from his mouth, and it's impressive. But you see it in print, and it's just ugly.","Nothing you do for children is ever wasted. They seem not to notice us, hovering, averting our eyes, and they seldom offer thanks, but what we do for them is never wasted.","I talk in subjects and verbs, and sort of wind around in concentric circles until I get far enough away from the beginning so that I can call it the end, and it ends.","It's a shallow life that doesn't give a person a few scars.","My religion would be a gentle faith that believed in the sacredness of leisure. Napping as a form of prayer.","Sometimes you have to look reality in the eye, and deny it.","A lovely thing about Christmas is that it's compulsory, like a thunderstorm, and we all go through it together.","Lake Wobegon, the little town that time forgot and the decades cannot improve.","I write for a radio show that, no matter what, will go on the air Saturday at five o'clock central time. You learn to write toward that deadline, to let the adrenaline pick you up on Friday morning and carry you through, to cook up a monologue about Lake Wobegon and get to the theater on time.","Zoroastrians believe in one Great Almighty Spirit of Good who is in combat against evil forces, and Goodness prevails in the end. There is no self-flagellation or staring at the sun or snake-handling.","I think the most un-American thing you can say is, 'You can't say that.'","God writes a lot of comedy... the trouble is, he's stuck with so many bad actors who don't know how to play funny.","I want to resume the life of a shy person.","I believe in looking reality straight in the eye and denying it.","Even in a time of elephantine vanity and greed, one never has to look far to see the campfires of gentle people.","A minister has to be able to read a clock. At noon, it's time to go home and turn up the pot roast and get the peas out of the freezer.","They say such nice things about people at their funerals that it makes me sad that I'm going to miss mine by just a few days.","The highlight of my childhood was making my brother laugh so hard that food came out of his nose.","I'm not busy... a woman with three children under the age of 10 wouldn't think my schedule looked so busy.","A good newspaper is never nearly good enough but a lousy newspaper is a joy forever.","I've wanted to be a writer since I was a boy, though it seemed an unlikely outcome since I showed no real talent. But I persevered and eventually found my own row to hoe. Ignorance of other writers' work keeps me from discouragement and I am less well-read than the average bus driver.","I love New York, and I'm drawn to a certain intensity of life, but I've just never felt like I want to escape from the Midwest. A writer lives a great deal in his own head, and so one intuitively finds places where your head is more clear. New York for me is one of those places.","When you're in your 20s, your 30s, even, you have - at least, I had - vast ambitions, and you sit around mooning about these things, and you're depressed, because you haven't done them. And it takes you a long time to come to the realization that if you can't be John Updike, well, then, you can't.","I was an English major at the University of Minnesota, and I was very shy, which many people misinterpreted as intelligence. On the basis of that wrong impression, I became the editor of the campus literary magazine.","I don't have a great eye for detail. I leave blanks in all of my stories. I leave out all detail, which leaves the reader to fill in something better.","Humor has to surprise us; otherwise, it isn't funny. It's a death knell for a writer to be labeled a humorist because then it's not a surprise anymore.","I hear a little firecracker go off when you come up with a good rhyme.","I love rhymes; I love to write a poem about New York and rhyme 'oysters' with 'The Cloisters.' And 'The lady from Knoxville who bought her brassieres by the boxful.' I just feel a sort of small triumph.","I think that if writers are tempted to do other things, they ought to go do other things. They should not write if they don't feel like it. I say this as a competitor. I am not interested in encouraging people who are in competition with me.","I can write anywhere. I write in airports. I write on airplanes. I've written in the back seats of taxis. I write in hotel rooms. I love hotel rooms. I just write wherever I am whenever I need to write."],"Garry Disher":["I have no favourite genre or style but treat each novel with the same care, imagination and craftsmanship. It's as difficult to write a crime or a children's novel with a touch of style and grace as it is a literary novel.","At one level, an award is an endorsement, a confirmation, but I always find myself looking askance at awards and good reviews, as though another Garry Disher had earned them.","A good writer can set a thriller anywhere and make it convincing: the trick is to evoke the setting in such a way that it highlights the crime or unsettles the reader.","From my years of teaching creative writing, I know that new writers take the setting for granted, as simply a place to set the action, but setting is a vital element in fiction writing and deserves serious treatment.","Chopper Read attended a writing school I gave for inmates at Risdon Prison in Hobart many years ago. Even if I hadn't known about his hacked-off ears and his criminal history, I'd have found him powerful and compelling.","Delaying and withholding tactics, red herrings, partial and doubtful outcomes are stock in trade for fiction writers, especially crime writers.","I grew up in a house full of books, and we belonged to the Country Lending Service - each month the State Library would send us a parcel of books by train.","To be a writer, you must be a reader, yet as many as 30 per cent of my writing students were not readers."],"Garry Hynes":["I remember thinking, 'I can't act.' Pretending to be someone else is a terrifying thought. The thing was that, along with other people, I could create a whole world. I felt absolutely right directing.","I was born in Ballaghadreen, but I grew up in Galway, and when I went to the University College of Galway, I became involved in the drama society there and started directing plays.","My father, Oliver Hynes, was an educator. He was originally just a teacher, a very good one, but then he was promoted to be in charge of education for the entire area. He was always an inspirational teacher. He was my big personal supporter, always coming here for the Tony Awards. My mother, Carmel, was a homemaker.","I think I'm attracted to writers who tell us something about ourselves.","I was the first woman to win a Tony for directing, but the second woman came along five minutes later.","I wouldn't call myself religious. I'm spiritual. Everybody's a bit more so as you get older. I'm a cultural Catholic; it's inescapable, but I think I have to believe.","I had spent time in New York, where I loved the idea that theater could be done up in tiny little rooms rather than for lots of money on a big stage, and be tied to ordinary life.","The English playwrights of the '50s and '60s didn't really keep writing or getting produced, while the Irish did. There's encouragement for the younger ones also in the fact that Ireland is exceptional in its ability to make theater part of the national dialogue, and it reaches to all four corners of the country.","Plays by people like Martin McDonagh and Brian Friel attract huge audiences, not because they're Irish, but because they're brilliant plays.","I think women are in much the same place in the Irish theater as they are everywhere else. Certainly, we have wonderful Irish writers, and we have quite a number of Irish women directors. But there could be more, and there should be more.","I still get called 'a stick of dynamite' or 'pint-sized dynamo,' stuff like that. Actually, I was too busy to notice there was anything unusual about being a woman director until the early 1980s, when I looked around the professional theater and realized there weren't many of us. You have to make more of a case for yourself than any man.","The odd thing about 'Cripple of Inishmaan' is it's never actually been performed on the island.","There wasn't anyone in my family who was involved in the theatre. I saw a few amateur plays when I was growing up, but I can't think of anything that happened or anybody in particular who inspired me; it all came from within.","As far as Irish writers being great, I think the fact that there have been two languages in Ireland for a very long time; there has obviously been a shared energy between those two languages."],"Garry Kasparov":["Chess helps you to concentrate, improve your logic. It teaches you to play by the rules and take responsibility for your actions, how to problem solve in an uncertain environment.","Ukraine had quite serious impact on the many Russians. They could see that ordinary people in Ukraine which is a bordering state, very close to Russia, the people of this state are, they didn't want to tolerate anymore the power abuse by Ukrainian officials.","I started playing chess when I was five years old. I learned the moves from my mother, then worked with my father - and later trainers. My style became very technical. I sacrificed a lot of things. I was always hunting for the king, for the mate. I'd forget about my other pieces.","You cannot say, 'Go! Go! Rah! Rah! Good move!' People want some emotion. Chess is an art and not a spectator sport.","I think our chances are not looking great today but the only way to fail for me is just not to try.","Putin recognized that if he could get enough money, everything would be under control.","Chess is mental torture.","Women, by their nature, are not exceptional chess players: they are not great fighters.","I learned that fighting on the chess board could also have an impact on the political climate in the country.","In chess, we have styles - like in any other field. There are also fashions in the kinds of systems that people play. So I'm trying to know my opponent as much as possible.","It's quite difficult for me to imagine my life without chess.","At the end of the day, it's all about money.","The only successor to President Putin is President Putin himself and we could of course dream about President Putin stepping down voluntarily and picking out successor which would be probably as bad as him.","It was not about losing my mental power; it's about not feeling good about my contribution to the game.","I organize a chess festival in Hungary. I support chess in schools, and I have my own chess foundation. And I started writing books.","I think we have very steady records of President Putin, who inherited the country with democratic values.","Putin can't afford to leave the office because he will be in real danger of being prosecuted for things he and his people did during their stay in power.","There are many facts showing that Putin's people enriched themselves by using power mechanisms so that's why for them losing power means losing their fortunes.","I've met enough KGB colonels in my life.","I think that it's a vital moment now for Russian democracy to convince people that it's only our actions, our joined actions and protests that could force Kremlin to reconsider its plans to abolish presidential elections.","There are many ways of showing your protest and discontent without the actions of Kremlin.","More and more people in my country recognise the dangers of having their governors appointed by Putin and having no influence in parliament because Parliament today is also following instructions from Kremlin and no longer represents its people.","If you make a decision to fight for future of your own country you have to consider all the consequences.","I have some security that could protect me against provocations but of course there are more terrible actions that could not be stopped by any security.","I wouldn't overestimate the importance of my popularity in the country and abroad but at the end of the day it's not as important because I believe that my presence here could make some difference and it could encourage people.","I have some strategical vision, I could calculate some few moves ahead and I have an intellect that is badly missed in the country which is run by generals and colonels.","Russian Parliament today is a bunch of puppets that just fall in with the instructions from Kremlin.","The real political life in Russia unfortunately is not in the parliament but on the streets and in the media.","I think Russians today have a distorted picture of capitalism, liberal democracy and market economy.","I think Russian people are learning that democracy is not an alien thing; it's not a western invention.","We have to stop the propaganda, the shameful propaganda used by Kremlin to rehabilitate these old types.","It didn't take long to recognise the shortcomings of the Soviet regime and to see the values of the free world.","I may play some exhibition games so I don't want to quit the game of chess completely. I just decided and it's a firm decision not to play competitive chess anymore.","I'm still number one and I just recently won a major tournament ahead of my toughest rivals so I think I had a few years ahead of me if I decided to stay.","We've been saying Putin is a dictator for years who doesn't care about the law.","Putin is like Al Capone.","I have great energy and I have great tasks ahead of me.","I want to serve chess through games, books that are works of art. I would like to bring the game closer to many people all over the world.","Chess was natural for me; I was extremely successful."],"Garry Marshall":["It's a hard job. It means giving up some things, but on the other hand they keep saying you can have it all. You can't really have it all so easy. You can do a little of this and little of that.","When in doubt, you bring in relatives. Nepotism is a part of my work.","I am a total believer of making the process a good time - make it memorable, have some fun, try to shoot high in your quality and then don't get crazy, see what happens.","Religion has a good place and it has its good people.","We can't compete with Mel Gibson, but we figured we could do our part.","Editing is the only process. The shooting is the pleasant work. The editing makes the movie, so I spend all my life in editing.","When I edit, I'm not from the school of Hello, I'm a genius, so everybody shut up. I'm from the school of Let's play it once in front of an audience, and then I'll tell you where it is going.","I don't sit well. I like to move around as I talk.","There's no better satisfaction than writing. I feel that writing is the best and everything else comes with it.","You go to a theater now and you literally see parents watching the movie and they suddenly cover their kid's ears. I figured I'd make one movie where they didn't have to do this.","There is more to life than show business.","In the education of the American people, I am Recess.","I try to find scripts of stories that kinda celebrate the human condition... let's talk about the tough world out there and the human spirit overcoming adversity.","I was a journalist. I was a drummer. I was everything. I didn't know what the heck I was. But with Jack Paar, the job was very specific - no confusion. You came in each day. You wrote five pages of jokes. You handed the pages in... The pressure was to write five pages of jokes every day. I did it, and I thought, 'This is what I like to do.'","I didn't want to do movies with hundreds of camels crossing the desert followed by tanks and this and that.","My mother was funnier than anybody I ever worked for. My father was as funny as this coat. Not a laugh a minute, my father.","Some journalists are pestier than others, so I find out where the pests are. I am careful with my actors and actresses. I come back and tell them, 'Watch out for this one or that one.' People are surprised I do that. But I watch out for them even after the movie is over.","A lot of people come work with me because I keep an open set, and people can visit. Julia Roberts used to have friends visit on 'Pretty Woman.'","I must confess that the original 'Pretty Woman' was terrific and a hit, but I always felt that creatively I didn't do justice to Richard Gere's character. So in the musical, we have some great new moments for Richard's character.","My first name, with the rare two-r spelling, came from a sportswriter named Garry Schumacher. My parents didn't know him personally, but my mother liked the spelling.","My happiest moments of growing up in the Bronx were when my mom would bring home a new sports magazine from the candy store. I would jump out of bed and grab it from her. Then I'd rip the front cover right off and tape it to my bedroom wall.","When I was five years old, my parents gave me a drum set for Christmas. My mom played the piano, and Dad played the saxophone badly. But that Christmas morning, I remember we all played together, and I thought it was the greatest day ever.","I never got beaten up, because I was a wisecracking jokester. I could make a bully laugh before he delivered a punch.","I always wanted to be known as the Norman Rockwell of television, and 'Happy Days' represented the part of me that wanted to make mainstream America laugh."],"Garry Moore":["Christmas is, of course, the time to be home - in heart as well as body."],"Garry Shandling":["Nice guys finish first. If you don't know that, then you don't know where the finish line is.","Humor is a wonderful way to deal with our suffering because if we can laugh at our troubles, we can feel better. Thich Nhat Hanh is a special man who has helped millions with their suffering with incredible technique. But he doesn't know real suffering, because he has not dated as much as I have.","I've always felt that the truth is in the silence.","I'm dating a woman now who, evidently, is unaware of it.","I once saw an elaborate landscape in a gallery, drawn in pencil, that took my breath away. Then I realized the artist probably didn't have enough confidence to use a pen.","Nobody can write better jokes putting me down than me.","I don't think I'm severely politically active. I care deeply, and I have my strong personal beliefs. I think America is dancing on thin ice. But I think it's bigger even than a political issue. I wonder about the evolution of the human race and spirit and what our goals and reasons for living are.","My friends tell me I have an intimacy problem. But they don't really know me.","You know it's funny that none of the regular late-night shows now use guest hosts the way Johnny did. No one talks about it much, but it's curious that they don't do it. They would each have to be asked the reason why they don't.","I may discuss love, and I don't mind if two men fall in love, fine. Two women, fine. But I flinch when I think of two Jewish women getting together and having a child because the idea of having two Jewish mothers makes my head explode. I have one; I couldn't handle two.","The art of boxing is seeing spaces and being able to take shots. The hitting and being hit have to become one. Your reactions have to be so in the moment. There's no time to think.","I have spent a lot of time studying the issue of relationships, how I grew up, my parents' influence on me. I've talked to a therapist,; I've looked inward spiritually at myself, and what it seems to come down to is that I'm a Sagittarius. Please don't make me reveal more than that. It's tough enough as it is.","I play basketball on Sundays and I'm a very spiritual guy; I read a lot of Eastern philosophy and I meditate.","I've been on a state of high alert since high school. I didn't need 9/11 to remind me that we live on a ball of flame.","I actually think I'm more of a turtle than Verne is. Where Verne is up on two legs and moving at full speed and doesn't pull his head into the shell very often, I in reality was five or ten minutes later to every recording session.","Here's the thing - I'm single, I haven't been married, I don't have kids yet. If I do have kids I would be interested to see them in my life, so here's a movie for kids and I'm in there and I'm supposed to be kind of funny for kids.","I think sometimes I should do more carousing, because I don't do much and maybe it would be fun occasionally. It's hard for me to have fun and I'm a serious thinker and a searcher and funny from the front.","I've never had anyone put on a puppet show to convince me of anything. And I've done a lot of stuff. I don't know that I would put the puppets on when I was pitching a show. This was the head of the studio putting a puppet show on. And I'll tell you, he wasn't bad.","I practice safe sex - I use an airbag.","I feel that everything I do in my life I can do in a shorter time than most men can. It's the quality, not the quantity.","Dogs are not people. Be leery of any woman who refers to her dogs as her 'kids,' because you'll only end up paying for their schooling.","My first 'Tonight Show' was just one of those things - I mean this seriously - a cosmic, meant-to-be coming together of circumstance. You walk out there to do your first 'Tonight Show': Is the audience going to be hot? Are you going to be on fire? It's like an athlete: Are you going to have your moves at a peak?","I enjoy 'The Apprentice' and the one that's called 'Take My Life' and the other one called 'Stop Hitting Me.'","I once made love for an hour and fifteen minutes, but it was the night the clocks are set ahead.","But I really like hosting, I think it's a strength of mine. It allows me to improvise, and I love the spontaneity of that, and I think I'm funny behind the desk when interviewing someone.","Women need to know that not all guys are going to hurt them the way that the guy did before they started dating me. I know guys I wouldn't go out with.","I am interested in how human beings react to crisis and conflict.","I am pretty tenacious as a perfectionist in terms of getting something right.","I guess he wanted to see a little more sexual activity because in real life, in bed I think less is more and let the woman come to me. Frankly, I don't even need a woman there.","I like going into nature and that's where I'm happiest.","I'm not a party guy. I don't carouse very much.","Which is, I'm an optimist that two people can be together to work out their conflicts. And that commitment, I think, might be what love is, because they both grow from their relationship.","I keep my scrapbooks in the car. When I come to a stoplight, I start looking through my past. Sometimes I wish the red lights were longer.","I'm too shy to express my sexual needs except over the phone to people I don't know.","Because I am afraid of commitment. This movie certainly has some bearing and is some reflection of my real feeling about relationships, because I do have commitment issues. My friends tell me I have intimacy problems, but they don't know me, so who cares what they think?","Carol Burnett was particularly funny. She swore for the first time on television on Larry Sanders.","First of all, I'm not the kind of guy that likes to rehash the show and so forth and so on.","I don't know how to ground myself without the other actor present.","I don't know why men are so fascinated with television and I think it has something to do with - if I may judge from my own father, who used to sit and stare at the TV while my mother was speaking to him - I think that's a man's way of tuning out.","I think I look great in green, and I'm going to start wearing more green.","I think it's one of the main negative emotional ingredients that fuels show business, because there's so much at stake and the fear of failure looms large.","My first appearance as a guest on The Tonight Show was in '81.","The only way I would go back to hosting would be if it were something entirely new. It would prevent me from wanting to host a standard-fare kind of talk show.","Without comedy as a defense mechanism I wouldn't be able to survive.","It's not the hair on your head that matters. It's the kind of hair you have inside.","I like to talk on the cell when I do interviews. That way, I double my chances of getting brain cancer: from the cell phone, and from the questions.","When I don't have a good time, it's usually because there's a stiffness that stifles creativity.","I'd like to do more acting.","Dr. Phil is hiding something. Otherwise, why wouldn't he use his last name?","Everyone at a party is uncomfortable. Knowing that makes me more comfortable.","It takes me so long to get tired of a man. It's women that are the problem. Don't get me wrong. I think men have their problems just as much as women.","'The Larry Sanders Show,' it's actually about love, which would sound like a paradox at first. But if that love didn't exist, the darker attitudes would not play. You would have a one-dimensional, cynical show, which I don't think the show was.","Men who betray women also betray other men. Women shouldn't feel so special.","There's a good chance that if you're talking to me when I'm snoring, it means I'm bored.","I started boxing for exercise, and on the very first day, the trainer got in the ring with me and said, 'Whoever controls the breathing in the ring controls the fight.' I immediately passed out.","I have this very abstract idea in my head. I wouldn't even want to call it stand-up, because stand-up conjures in one's mind a comedian with a microphone standing onstage under a spotlight telling jokes to an audience. The direction I'm going in is eventually, you won't know if it's a joke or not.","When I give notes on a script, I say, 'Guys, I may drift, but it's part of the process.' So I'm aware that I'm drifting, but I'm grabbing a lot of stuff.","I had no idea who I was when I started. I was frightened to death and had no natural performing skills.","My second or third year in the engineering department, I got very frustrated, and I sat down with myself and had a soul-searching conversation with myself and said, 'What I'd really like to do is see if I can write comedy.' ... I moved to L.A. stone cold. Didn't know anybody; didn't know how to go about it. Really started from scratch.","To be thrown onto the stand-up stage is an experience that you cannot fathom until you're actually there, because there's no place to go, and everyone is looking at you and you can't even see them because of the lights. And yet you have to manage to start talking and be funny on top of it.","Some people think the world will end in 2012. I think we've got until 2014. I'm an optimist.","I watch the news, which is its own reality show. I love 'Curb Your Enthusiasm.' I love it because it's funny and because I realize that I'm happier than Larry David.","I'm proud of Larry Sanders and proud of every single person who went on that journey. It's a very special show to me, and I've learned a lot of lessons from it. I need to find something where I can learn some more lessons, and then I'll do that project.","That's what we were exploring on 'Larry Sanders' - the human qualities that have brought us to where we are now in the world: the addiction to needing more and wanting more and talking more. We were examining the labels put on success - is it successful to be on TV every day, to be famous, to have a paycheck?"],"Garry Tan":["Bitcoin will make a dent in society when more normal transactions occur that would have occurred with dollars or credit card.","Bitcoin has the potential to destroy credit cards and banks as we know it. Maybe that is a good thing or a bad thing, but I like the idea that if someone needs to remit payments, they can do it without being gouged.","Being right is important. Too many great teams march off saying, 'If we build it, they will come,' and then never are able to change the idea towards something that people really want."],"Garry Trudeau":["I'm still passionately interested in what my fellow humans are up to. For me, a day spent monitoring the passing parade is a day well-spent.","Well, it's a humor strip, so my first responsibility has always been to entertain the reader... But if, in addition, I can help move readers to thought and judgment about issues that concern me, so much the better.","Commencement speeches were invented largely in the belief that outgoing college students should never be released into the world until they have been properly sedated.","I've been trying for some time to develop a lifestyle that doesn't require my presence.","In Palm Springs, they think homelessness is caused by bad divorce lawyers.","The systematic dismantling of reproductive rights, much like the takedown of collective bargaining, has been taking place in full view.","Coming up with ideas is really hard - they don't spontaneously pop into my head while I'm cutting vegetables.","Becoming the new feminine ideal requires just the right combination of insecurity, exercise, bulimia and surgery.","Life is like a movie-since there aren't any commercial breaks, you have to get up and go to the bathroom in the middle of it.","Lives have been altered in fundamental ways, and later, after they acquire a more complete understanding of what goals are actually attainable, many are left facing a lot of pain and frustration. And yet, there's no culture of complaint.","I try to take people one at a time, with all the contradictions and compromises that most of us live with.","In any event, it's not exactly a secret to regular readers what my views on the war are.","I don't think so, but it's always in the back of my mind that many of the soldiers being wounded and killed in Iraq are about the same age as my kids. My godson is going over soon, so the war's about to get personal for me.","The strips about the military do seem to provoke moving and thoughtful responses. It's nice when the strip resonates, but more importantly, I need to know when I'm getting something wrong. The last thing I want to do is contribute to the suffering that wounded warriors already endure.","Humor can inform and break down stigma, which is a huge issue in the military.","I just happen to have one of those skill sets that allows me to work in my underwear.","I've never taken any issue off the table for lack of suitability. Only for lack of imagination.","Any time you bring sexuality into the comics pages, you have to brace for pushback.","Medical decisions have been politicized. What doctor wants a state legislator in his consulting room?","I've been getting pulled from newspapers for my entire career.","There's always been some concern that adult subject matter should be quarantined from a page that attracts children. Unlike late at night, when 'South Park' and 'Colbert' are on, impressionable minds are wide awake when the newspaper arrives.","For the most part, editors no longer view 'Doonesbury' as a rolling provocation, which is fine by me. It makes no sense to intentionally antagonize the very people on whose support you most depend.","I don't want to sound disingenuous here - controversy is obviously good for business, especially if your business is satire. And it does amplify the discussion - in my view, a good thing.","As far as I'm concerned, there is no subject that's off the table.","I'm a pointillist, just working my tiny little piece of the canvas. I'm not so good at perspective.","In their heyday, comics were a dominant force in popular culture, but that's over.","That's what fiction writers do: create characters and do terrible things to them for the entertainment of others. If they feel guilty enough, they write happy endings.","I found that not having a public profile was not hurting the work, and it freed me up to be the satirist I wanted to be.","There is nothing worse than annotated humour.","Satire is a form of social control, it's what you do. It's not personal. It's a job.","Because I was a diminutive, arty kid, I felt like a misfit in high school - but who doesn't?","I'm never happier than when I'm not working. The strip is a job - that's why I take money for it. It's a job I'm passionate about, but it's a job I totally leave in the studio when I walk out of here, unless I'm late and I have to work at home. I never think of the strip unless I'm compelled to.","When you're young, you don't feel iconoclastic - you're just kind of doing what seems natural, what moves you.","I think it's very dangerous for people who do anything that's public to venture on the Web and check out what people are saying about them. Yes, you're bound to find things that will delight you - but you also find things that will make you brood and feel bad about yourself. Why would you intentionally invite that into your life?","Comic-strip artists generally have very modest ambitions. Day to day, we labor to fit together all these little moving parts - a character or two, a few lines of dialogue, framing, pacing, payoff - but we certainly don't think of them adding up over time to some larger portrait of our times.","When you're young, with less on the line, it's easier to be audacious, to experiment. So I introduced the concerns of my generation - politics, sex, drugs, rock-and-roll, etc. - to the comics page, which for many years caused a rolling furor.","Having stretched the boundaries some, I'm perfectly content now to work within them. 'Doonesbury' doesn't need to become 'South Park.' You won't ever see any singing turds.","I can only try to keep the characters interesting; it's up to the readers to decide whether they're still relevant.","I try not to second-guess editors; they're the clients, and I have no expectation that my strip is going to make it into every paper every day.","Comic strips are like a public utility. They're supposed to be there 365 days a year, and you're supposed to be able to hit the mark day after day."],"Garry Wills":["The leader is one who mobilizes others toward a goal shared by leaders and followers... Leaders, followers and goals make up the three equally necessary supports for leadership.","Leadership - mobilization toward a common goal.","Only the winners decide what were war crimes.","I don't really write for an audience. I just write what the subject seems to me to require.","There's an interesting contrast between born Catholics and converts. Converts are often much more rule-directed. Catholicism isn't something that they breathed in from their childhood, so they think that if you don't toe the line on abstract doctrine you can't be part of the Church.","I have been an outsider in journalism and in the academy, because I never fully belonged to any of them.","I'm hardly macho. I present myself as very unnoticeable.","I would rather listen to plays in the car than read them.","I don't get far enough into a boring book to hate it.","I have nothing against priests. In fact, I tried for a time to be one... It should be clear, then, that I respect, and am often fond of, the many priests in my life."],"Garry Winogrand":["Photography is about finding out what can happen in the frame. When you put four edges around some facts, you change those facts.","There is nothing as mysterious as a fact clearly described. I photograph to see what something will look like photographed."],"Garson Kanin":["A man ninety years old was asked to what he attributed his longevity. I reckon, he said, with a twinkle in his eye, it because most nights I went to bed and slept when I should have sat up and worried.","Amateurs hope, professionals work.","Books are men of higher stature; the only men that speak aloud for future times to hear.","The best part of one's life is the working part, the creative part. Believe me, I love to succeed... However, the real spiritual and emotional excitement is in the doing."],"Garth Brooks":["Just keep taking chances and having fun.","You aren't wealthy until you have something money can't buy.","Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers.","I just love to see people having a good time.","Thank God I'm with the love of my life. That's why I know I'm right where I'm supposed to be.","True country music is honesty, sincerity, and real life to the hilt.","Happiness isn't getting what you want, it's wanting what you got.","Be with someone who is kind. I think that's it. Just to love one another was the thing I would want to do. It's a thing that you can't stop doing.","I'd much rather have the honesty than not. Because if you will say what's on your mind and get it off your chest, then the sooner I can prove you wrong!","It's funny how a chubby kid can just be having fun, and people call it entertainment!","The greatest conflicts are not between two people but between one person and himself.","Here's my whole marketing idea: treat people the way you want to be treated.","Stand straight, walk proud, have a little faith.","I live my life by these little church signs you see as you drive around, and there's one near me that says, 'If we really knew each other, we would neither idolise nor condemn.' And that's it: if we all knew each other, then we wouldn't treat anybody any different. And there wouldn't be any big stars, I guess.","If you're true to yourself, you just do what you do.","Sometimes I thank God... for cheeseburgers.","I'm much too young to feel this damn old.","I wouldn't trade a thing. Even the troubles that I had. I have become the husband and mate to my wife that I have because of what I went through, including the bad times. I wouldn't trade that.","I'm very square and proud of it. The flag stays on the porch here.","That smell of freshly cut grass makes me think of Friday night football in high school. The smell of popcorn and cigar smoke reminds me of the stadium. The cutting of the grass reminds me of the August practice.","The most important days, more than any Grammy award thing or anything, is the day that you're responsible for snacks after the game.","Whatever I do, I hope it's quality, I hope it's something that's class.","While I'm playing baseball, I'm still writing songs and having tapes sent to me. I'm sure I'll spend a lot of time in the whirlpool resting these tired bones, so I'll be thinking of music then.","If I have any talent at all it's from God, and my mom, who was on Capitol Records also.","I still use the guitar pretty much just to hide my gut.","You can't succeed if you don't know what losing is.","Once you've figured out how to wait on people and clean toilets, it makes you very mindful of how you treat the people who are serving you.","The great thing about albums is it gives you a lot of choices, and we can all say that the album business is dead, but watch Taylor Swift. I don't think it's dead. I just think we've got to hit on the energies that make people want to collect albums.","I'm worried a lot of our work day as artists is a producer's creation - not an artist's creation.","Country music is what is sincere; that's the main thing.","Any pitcher who might throw at me should know I'm not giving up my day job or trying to get anyone else's job. I just can't think of anything cooler than being one of the boys of summer!","Any time I'm in a moving thing, like an airplane, I'm usually asleep before we even get on our way.","As a kid, before I could play music, I remember baseball being the one thing that could always make me happy.","Because of the changes in the Padres team I played with last year, I felt like a veteran recently when I worked out with Jason Kendall and he told me he's liked listening to my records since he was a kid!","Don't change a thing. That's one of the best gimmicks a band could ever come up with.","I don't know of too many double Christmas albums, so it is something that's new, and hopefully will be fun, and there's plenty of stuff out there to cut.","I got an offer in 1992 to buy a major-league team. I turned down the offer because I don't want my love of the game to involve business.","I like to follow my favorite team and talk sports with my band or fans. You won't believe how many musicians are sports fans. We have so much time on tour that we need these outlets for relaxation.","I want to get within myself and write. I really, really want to write.","I wouldn't mind producing a movie with a music storyline, but acting in one is too close to home.","I'd like to think a baseball picture is somewhere in my future.","I'd love to play a villain in a movie, the kind of bad guy you would never think of me being able to play. Like most people, I have a darker side I'd like to explore onscreen.","I'm a big movie fan. After a show, if I'm on the bus or a plane, it's often hard to get to sleep, so I'll watch a film. An action film can even relax me.","I've been taking batting practice in my barn where nobody can see me, so I may be better than anyone thinks.","It would have been fun to have played Tim Robbins' role in Bull Durham.","No matter what you say you might do, you never really know until you're in the moment. Every situation is so different.","People aren't always themselves. They're always holding back something.","You know me, I've got to find some way to get a fresh fire.","The guys have told me not to quit my day job.","I believe in the 'Wal-Mart' school of business. The less people pay, the more they enjoy it.","If God came down here with the box that had the reason for living in it, I'd like to find just 2 words: The Music. That would be neat.","I love being a part of country music. I love going out and... doing things for the first time for country music. I always enjoy that.","There's a difference between knowing what's on the page in a history book and actually feeling that page have curves and valleys.","I spend all my time right now trying to combat music retail and copyright.","I remember in the '80s, Randy Travis was my guy. He's the reason I moved to Nashville, and I just loved him. But at some point when he was winning everything, you find yourself pulling for other people.","You know Nashville, there's people that are ten times more talented than me, ten times better singer than me, song writer than me, but for some reason you get the ball and now - and now you run with it. And you do the best you can.","My hardest thing was to let go, to be happy for everybody and just to enjoy. And go back to being what you were before you became an artist, and that was just a fan.","I try to do my best.","Nashville, there's people that are ten times more talented than me, ten times better singer than me, song writer than me, but for some reason you get the ball, and now - and now you run with it. And you do the best you can.","If we see too much of one person, even though we like that person, we start to kind of pull for other people.","In our house, everyone's opinion is welcome. I grew up in a house where everything wasn't when it came to politics or religion.","My father and brothers were in the military.","I am the last guy that wants to quit making music.","That's what you want to do as an older artist - you want to reinvent, but there has to be that vein in there for why people were listening to you before in the first place.","How many songs in your life were your favorite songs but never were singles on albums?","The hardest part about this business is accepting the back end with the same love that you accepted the front end.","People said, 'How could you walk away from music?' But being a dad - there's nothing that can touch that.","I don't care if people remember Garth Brooks.","I'm one of those guys who has to have a constant something going inside and in front of my face. If not, I get in trouble.","I go home, and I'm a blob. I just lay there and don't do anything - lay by the pool with the other husbands while the wives work. It's fantastic. It's really good. That's kind of our life at home.","In advertising, you have a small window to say the most you can. That's what songwriting is. The difference is, you get to put the leaves on the trees and colour 'em in.","I can take the steel guitars and fiddles off, we can make it a little more pop, cover ideas that are a little less cowboy. But you got to look at yourself in the mirror and ask, whose flag you are under? For Garth Brooks, I'm steel, fiddles, red, white and blue.","It's the sweetest thing to be a parent of a daughter. When they hit their twenties, they become these lovebugs that come back. It's just so sweet.","My retiring days are behind me - they're going to have to throw me out now.","What you do on tour is you build this 'You and me against the world' thing.","You can't deny RCA's past and its history. I was also on Capitol Records, so I have that past history.","I feel very lucky to get to fly the flag of RCA Records and Sony Music.","I don't think the label makes the artist or the artist makes the label. It's the music that makes everything work or not.","The dads across the soccer field looked at me as a dad just like them. And I was very grateful.","There's always hunger to create because I believe that's what I do. I believe that's what I'm supposed to be doing.","Why I got into music was James Taylor, so to see him be a real down-to-earth guy that's unbelievably talented... then to hear him sing those lyrics of 'What I'm Thankful For,' which is a song Ms. Yearwood and I got to write together, that was definitely a highlight of my recording life.","I wrote 'The River' practically trying to rip off every lick that James Taylor had, so it was neat to hear him sing those lyrics because that's who inspired you to write them.","Awards are for young people. They just are.","I introduce her as the love of my life everywhere that we go. She introduces me as her current husband. So you can see how the relationship kinda works here.","No offense to music - thank you for Entertainer of the Year and all that stuff. But if you're a father or a mother, there's nothing that beats being a parent, and that's the best time of my life right there.","Before the show, we see all these radio people, and most of them say, 'Garth, you're a lot calmer than I thought you were gonna be.' But when the members of the band give one another that handshake, and the lights go out, and the crowd goes up, then you're sliding into the elevator, man, your heart is just going bopbopbopbopbop.","We're just a real dirty band. We're raw, and we're rough. None of us are top-scale, top-line musicians. But I tell you what, you get your top-line musicians and see if they can entertain like us.","When I went to see Kansas and Queen and Styx, I don't even remember the music. But I know what I saw.","I was lucky enough to go home and raise our babies.","I don't think it's changed that much when you go on the principle if Garth introduced more rock into country music, then Florida Georgia Line's gonna introduce more dance and more beat-driven stuff into country music. That's just how it's gonna go. So whatever influences you as a kid, you're gonna put in your music.","If the artists would just keep hammering away - unify, stick together - then music will become the king again, which is what it should be.","Music should always be first.","I'm gonna stay an album guy. In fact, concept albums are really blowing my mind right now, because if you want to promote an album, think about it - a concept album might be the way to go.","With Ghost Tunes, you just try to do what's right. And what's right is whatever the copyright owner wants to do with their music, they do it.","All the artists out there, I ask you and beg you: Take over your ship. It's your career. It's your life.","Your band members? Your band members don't want to be tied to a machine. They want to be playing. That's what the Beatles did. And the Beatles' stuff is timeless. That's what I would suggest. Just get back to sweating, playing hard, hammering, and having a blast.","One of the greatest gifts we have is our own mistakes and somebody singing about them.","I spend most of my time at concerts hoping for that one second that the artist looks at me, I look at the artist, and that's when I get to say, 'Thank you.'","Doing new stuff live is tough just simply because I pay my money, I stand in my seats, and I see the guys I love. And if I paid that ticket, there's a good chance that I'm there to hear the stuff that made me fall in love with 'em - we call it the 'old stuff.'","Music keeps you eternally young. It just does.","What I love about 'Midnight Train' is that it's a song about a journey, but the music actually takes you on that journey. It feels like you're moving through the whole song."],"Garth Davis":["Filmmaking is not a job but a social responsibility for me.","I'm just trying to approach what I make with as much respect and research as I can, and just make it with a good heart.","I've always just focused on the work, and I've just tried to be honest with the work. If the work speaks to people, fantastic.","The way I work is I like to immerse myself in the world of the film and in the character's lives, and then from that, I get a lot of ideas of how the film could be made, how it could be told.","I love going to the cinema and thinking you're seeing something, and you end up on a whole other planet, and you can't believe it.","I want to do stories that really move me, that have an audience, and at the end of the day, I want people to feel something when they walk out of the cinema.","Audiences are smart, and they don't need to be spoon-fed everything.","I always want to work on things that really scare me and interest me at the same time, and you know, I definitely had some projects in the past that did that, but the stars never aligned in getting them up. So 'Lion' was another project that really interested me, and the stars did align on this one. It just happened to be my first film!","There's no doubt that 'Lion' is an audience pleaser. I mean, I went to a lot of research screenings all over, in London and America and Australia, and the results were ridiculous, and the crowds were... they just loved the movie, so for me, my job is done.","Most of the available Indian films in Australia are Bollywood. I did not watch them. In my early days, I watched Satyajit Ray's 'Apu Trilogy,' which was a beautiful take on social realism.","I'm very drawn to the human condition and the emotional aspects of stories. It's what's not on the page that I get excited about.","I like to be involved with the scriptwriter early on, helping shape the story, and working out how the story can be told directorially.","I definitely storyboard, but I only start once I have cast and location. I like to find the world first.","My whole approach is very much about using the locations as a world, trying to find the beauty in the time of day we shoot or the ugliness of it, in cases.","Sometimes we make films just for our people, and it doesn't reach to anyone.","I loved 'Monsoon Wedding' and 'Lunchbox' because they had 'real' stories. I wish there are more films made like them."],"Garth Ennis":["You know, I think I did originally have some sort of idea of maybe a Where Eagles Dare kind of mission against impossible odds, but it really sort of died before I had a chance to really go anywhere with it, and then just doing the book was out of the question.","Yeah, Hitman I suppose is most of the time a lighter read than Preacher; it was always going to be.","Wouldn't want to write the X-Men, and I suppose the X-Men is the ultimate Marvel comic, and I really wouldn't want to go anywhere near it at all, although on the other had I wouldn't mind having a crack at something like the Punisher.","With a mini series you can give the story a proper sense of pacing, a proper sense of closure.","There's immense fun to be had as long as you can sort of sneak it past DC. I have been told on occasion that I need to have more respect for these characters.","Preacher is a book that somehow allows me time by its settling on it's characters, that sort of modern gothic western feel. You're not likely to see the boat veering too far from that.","Most regular superhero books are designed to go on forever; of course, very few of them do, but the point is they are trying to throw mud against the wall and hope it will stick, and most of it slides off.","It's nice to be in a situation where the two books that I write for a sort of regular monthly income are also works that I enjoy immensely, rather than them being some kind of bread and butter, do it because you have to do it.","It would have shown people that I was prepared to do that kind of work, although I find myself in a position now where I don't really need to and I could pick and choose the kind of characters I'd like to do.","If you look at Marvel Comics, there are very few Marvel characters I would like to write.","I'm sure you're aware, with the time it takes to put these books together, everything can suddenly start coming out at once even though I wrote anything between one and five years ago.","I suppose that Heartland, Unknown Soldier and Pride and Joy represent not a quieter side but more of a serious side to my work, something I've been getting into recently.","I guess you can stay sort of true to the story; you don't have to artificially bring the character back from whatever doom you've designed for them, you can tell the story, I suppose, honestly.","I don't necessarily write everything as automatically assuming it will be collected, there's nothing that says Hitman will be collected, though it might be.","I can't really put it in one sentence because although on one hand Preacher is about faith and yes it is also about, I suppose, the search for God, the search for faith and the manipulation and the abuse committed by figures in whom I suppose people have faith.","Hitman does well and it certainly does well enough to survive, but at the same time I don't want to involve the character into the DC Universe even if it meant more sales, to the point where we sort of upset the balance that we have at the moment.","As the scripts come in they are sent to the artists, and the artists are either very busy, or ready to start.","I've seen a fair bit of the States and the rest of the world, and I'm convinced that there's nowhere I'd be happier, there's nowhere I'm missing out on because I'm in N.Y.","The comics I read as a kid were much more influenced by TV and movies. Encountering superheroes as an adult without that kind of childhood sentimentality, it just doesn't allow you, or in my case at least, it wouldn't let me take the characters seriously.","I tend to forget what I'm doing will ever be read while I'm writing it, and just get on with the task at hand."],"Garth Hudson":["The reason I dislike talking about the creative process is that I do have a creative process that is a winner and it's a sure thing.","Unfortunately or fortunately, in order to become acquainted with the idiom of country or rock music, it is necessary to occasionally play in a bar. Bars are a rehearsal place."],"Garth Nix":["I find the presence of the sea quite inspiring, and sometimes I do just get out and walk around and take in the sea breeze to try and clear my mind.","Interestingly, it is often the younger members of the audience who ask the most sophisticated questions.","I tend to think of stories and books as being for everyone, just with an 'entry reading age' rather than an age range.","Writing for children, you do bear a responsibility to not include overt or graphic adult content that they are not ready for and don't need, or to address adult concepts or themes from an oblique angle or a child's limited viewpoint, with appropriate context, without being graphic or distressing.","I can understand the natural anxiety of readers when waiting for another installment of a favourite series, but I think it is much more important to get a book right than it is to have it appear on time.","There is a very big difference between writing for children and writing for young adults. The first thing I would say is that 'Young Adult' does not mean 'Older Children', it really does mean young but adult, and the category should be seen as a subset of adult literature, not of children's books.","In any genre you're working in, you can always find a way to tell a particular kind of story. I love fantasy; I love science fiction. I love all kinds of fiction, in fact.","Authors are influenced by everything they've ever read. If you've read widely enough, it helps you create your own mix.","I loved publishing; I loved working in the book industry, but I've been writing pretty much nonstop since I was 19. I realized very early on that I would need a day job, and I wanted one that was in books.","I studied writing at university, and I actually majored in screenwriting. Then I went to work as a bookseller and then as a sales rep and publicist and then various editorial jobs until I ended up with HarperCollins in Australia.","Unlike the stereotypical author, I've never had a job as a short-order cook, but I love cooking hot breakfasts for lots of people, juggling the eggs and the bacon and the tomatoes and the fried potatoes and so on.","I don't watch a lot of T.V., and I hardly ever have time to keep up with series, though I do love reruns of old favorites from my childhood like 'Dr. Who', 'The Goodies', and 'Get Smart.'","I like movies in particular, on video or T.V. I have lots of old favorites, like Danny Kaye in 'The Court Jester' or 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' or James Stewart in 'Winchester '73.' But I also like a lot of modern films.","I like to write books that I would have liked as a child, that would have got me thinking and imagining beyond the words on the page. In a way, my audience is always how I remember myself as a child.","With the 'Old Kingdom' trilogy, at least half the readers were older adults rather than younger adults. I wrote them for myself with no particular audience in mind.","In all my books, I try to have a strong element of realism underlying the fantastic.","If only one in 1,000 people that I talk to goes on to write a good book, that's one more good book that I've helped along... and maybe it will be a book I love myself five or 10 years down the line.","I grew up in a house full of books and parents who read, which led to me to reading from a very young age. And reading seemed to naturally progress to writing."],"Garth Risk Hallberg":["When I get online, there's this cycle of anxiety and narcissism that takes over, which is the part of me that I like the least.","Definitely, something is happening out there in Internet world at any given moment, but the likelihood that it's something that can't wait until that evening for you to find out about it is very small.","The ego being shattered is not what frightens me - that can be useful for writing - but the ego being inflated is sort of like it dying of gout.","I fell in love with New York at some indeterminate point in my early years.","Any character that can't be kept straight, to me, isn't a character who should be in the book - you know, anyone not vivid enough to have a claim on my attention.","I think several generations of my family had novels in the drawer. You know the montage in 'The Royal Tenenbaums' where each character has produced some sort of minor work? It was like having a magician in the household.","I have this weird tropism for islands. Take me to an island as far from New York as I can possibly go.","I grew up in a university town in eastern North Carolina - what's called Tobacco Road. It was very rural.","One of the ways I stuck out was I was a very passionate reader. There was probably a cyclical nature to that; the more I felt like an outcast, the more I sought refuge in books, and the more I sought refuge in books, the more it made me not speak the same language as my peers.","At 14 and 15, I was sort of my town's resident beatnik.","I had one week in the fall of 1996 where I was like, 'I'm America's greatest living teenage poet.'","It may be that Tolstoy and Virginia Woolf were sitting around fretting about their Amazon reviews or their pre-pub whatever, but I kind of doubt it. I don't think that's how the work probably got made.","Narnia, Middle-earth and New York were my three fantasy universes when I was a kid.","I remember reading 'The Hobbit' on a car trip from Ohio to Mississippi and getting out at a rest-stop in Mississippi and feeling jet-lagged at my return from Middle-earth.","If I could do what Hilary Mantel does, I would probably do that. She is more intelligent and a better researcher and knows more what she's about than I do.","I'm trying to focus on my job as I see it, which is to write the next thing and to remain, to the degree that I ever was, a noticer.","I think there is a real thing going on where writers are feeling more liberated to write with a big canvas because of a demonstrable, continued appetite for long-form storytelling.","I find it heartening that readers are still excited about diving into a world.","Reading was not just an escape or a Band-Aid; it was a deep form of feeling seen and recognized, and being able to see and recognize other kindred spirits. My dad was a writer, too, which also likely had something to do with that.","I had this dream that I was going to come to New York and be a writer.","I started coming up to New York at age 17. There was a girl I met over the summer somewhere; I was chasing her. I would drive up to D.C., where I had made some friends, which was about four hours away, and we would take the bus up to New York.","A fragmented film such as 'Babel' gives the impression of 'edginess' but, in its form, tells us nothing we didn't already know.","When something is at risk or in danger or about to be lost, those are the moments you start to realize how much it means to you.","Reading isn't about managing expectations. In certain ways, writing is. You're trying to send signals early in a book about what might be coming later, but I think worrying about the kind of chatter around a book is something I try and stay as far away from when I'm reading.","The writing that feels the best to me, I experience sometimes, is a kind of weirdly deep listening - like, it feels like if you just listen hard enough, the next sentence will tell you what it needs to be.","I always thought I was going to be a great poet, and go and live in New York, where the great poets lived - you know, where Whitman had walked the streets.","I'd been coming to New York for weekends since I was 17, and after 9/11, I started making these trips more frequently, just to make contact with the city.","I happen to be the kind of reader who, if I like something, I don't want it to end.","In graduate school, I was a student of E.L. Doctorow, and he had us read 'Moby-Dick' in a week.","I had a major bug for cities and for paintings and literature and all the things I thought went on in cities.","I was working my first adult job, a quasi journalistic job, writing content for a website. In the offices, we had banks of TVs, papers, a constant media stream, which was unusual for 2001.","The central question driving literary aesthetics in the age of the iPad is no longer 'How should novels be?' but 'Why write novels at all?'","You don't have to subject yourself to the sweep and rigor of Bourdieu's book 'Distinction' to feel how thoroughly a lower-calorie version of its ideas has been absorbed into the cultural bloodstream.","We who curate our Twitter feeds and Facebook walls understand that at least part of what we're doing publicly, 'like'-ing what we like, is trying to separate ourselves from the herd.","Writers since at least the heyday of Gore Vidal have bemoaned their audience's defection to other forms of entertainment.","In college, I was a huge fan of 'Les Miserables.' I seem to remember that people who were into French literature preferred Hugo's poetry.","For some reason, I spent my early thirties reading as much postwar Hungarian fiction as I could get my hands on.","I came to feel that, in addition to Imre Kertesz, Hungary has produced at least three contemporary novelists who deserve the Nobel: Peter Nadas, Peter Esterhazy and Laszlo Krasznahorkai.","Sure, 'Les Miserables' can be melodramatic. And seeing the musical instead of reading the novel will save you some time and spare you the long part where Hugo goes on and on about the Parisian sewer system. But I would hate for the novel to lose that.","I respect Billy Joel, but I'm not a guy who's gonna sit down and listen to the entire 'Essential Billy Joel.'","I'm not confident in my own ability to resist the titanic force of my own ego.","I associated excellence in writing with New York City.","I don't quite know why, but I am long-winded."],"Garth Stein":["I know in this time of great technological advancement, the idea of reading a book seems almost anachronistic, but I think it's worth preserving.","Using a dog as a narrator has limitations and it has advantages. The limitations are that a dog cannot speak. A dog has no thumbs. A dog can't communicate his thoughts except with gestures.","Our dog, Comet, is a Lab/poodle mix. She's goofy and silly and sweet.","Anyone who has a dog knows that they have some very deep thoughts, that they have moods and emotions, they get their feelings hurt. It's not a far reach to give them opinions and values and long-term desires.","All athletes speak about the mental element of athletics, and it usually boils down to the same thing: if you can remove your ego from the game, you can function with much more clarity and you are more likely to succeed. Wouldn't it be interesting if we all began speaking about the mental element of our lives in this way?","In documentary films, you're a storyteller using found objects. You still have to have a story arc and all the elements that make a good story. It really helped me mature as a storyteller.","I think the one that's going to be the hardest to make into a film is the one that's probably going to be made into a film, which is 'The Art of Racing in the Rain.' I mean, it's narrated by a dog. How do you do that? But hopefully we'll get to see.","The craft of writing is all the stuff that you can learn through school; go to workshops and read books. Learn characterization, plot and dialogue and pacing and word choice and point of view. Then there's also the art of it which is sort of the unknown, the inspiration, the stuff that is noncerebral.","I gotta be honest with you... I hate numbers. I hate chapter numbers. I hate them.","I'm a writer because I love reading. I love the conversation between a reader and a writer, and that it all takes place in a book-sort of a neutral ground. A writer puts down the words, and a reader interprets the words, and every reader will read a book differently. I love that."],"Gary Ackerman":["The media has changed. We now give broadcast licenses to philosophies instead of people. People get confused and think there is no difference between news and entertainment. People who project themselves as journalists on television don't know the first thing about journalism. They are just there stirring up a hockey game.","You can compromise between good, better, and best, and you can compromise between bad and worse and terrible. But you can't compromise between good and evil. And now people look at the other side as a completely different kind of animal and say, 'They are taking the country down the road to purgatory.' It's complete intolerance.","It used to be you had real friends on the other side of the aisle. It's not like that anymore. Society has changed. The public is to blame as well. I think the people have gotten dumber.","As a state senator and then a congressman, I've had the privilege of trying to do good things for people to whom I owe so much and can never fully repay.","Without a musket to raise, a barricade to storm, a flag to wave, the question hit me in the face like the cold air: 'Who am I?'","If a jerk burns the flag, America is not threatened, democracy is not under siege, freedom is not at risk.","I just thought it was unconscionable for the Congress to insert itself into this debate. We are particularly unqualified to make that decision and to intrude ourselves into the lives of this family.","No, you can't call your vote in. You have to be there on the floor to vote.","Sometimes people who are Jewish are held to a higher standard which sometimes we take great pride in.","We have some Jewish members of Congress, not a lot but there's a bunch of us.","India is a regional power. It does not need anything to establish it.","I am always fascinated by India.","I'm in favor of immigration but we also need rules.","We have to have some rules and regulations in America, or the world would empty out here.","I've personally demanded that tyrants let their people go. I've tried to feed the hungry, clothe the poor, protect the elderly and infirm, and defend the needy from the aggressively greedy. I've led a blessed life. What a kick for a kid from the projects.","From the U.S. Capitol Building to the White House, our national symbols that represent freedom to so many of us, were built by people who were anything but free.","Using official government resources to help bankroll an explicit political agenda - whether on the right or left - is flat out wrong.","For some reason, the military seems more afraid of gay people than they are against terrorists, but they're very brave with the terrorists... If the terrorists ever got a hold of this information, they'd get a platoon of lesbians to chase us out of Baghdad.","The ability to convince people of the wackiest notions - and both parties can do it - it's part of the dumbing down of America that's really highly problematic.","The media's gotten lazy. They don't check anything out. You report what he reports.","People more than ever since I can remember are concerned about being out of step and out of line with their political party and won't cross over. There is nobody, man or woman, who wants to be left out, and people are fearful of that. People are fearful of their leadership as well.","Politics was my third act. But I could have a fourth. I don't know what that will be yet, but there will be one.","Whether rich people make money or lose money, they get no sympathy from the public.","Patriots don't let their nation default.","Looking forward, it might prove constructive to examine the true historical record of an issue prior to assuming the worst of anyone's motive and deconstructing and questioning anyone's Democratic bona fides. After all, we liberals got feelings.","There's a delicious irony in seeing private luxury jets flying in to Washington, D.C., and people coming off of them with tin cups in their hands saying that they're going to be trimming down and streamlining their businesses. There's a message there.","Telling people not to have children is unthinkable and inhumane.","We're not looking at banning all weapons.","I've had meetings with Fidel Castro. I've had meetings with Kim Il-Sung. I've had meetings with other dictators. I've met with the Butcher of Beijing. You know, I think it's important to hear, you know, each other's perspective.","Every gun sold should require a background check, period."],"Gary Allan":["You can be the moon and still be jealous of the stars.","Life ain't always beautiful, but it's a beautiful ride.","My goal is to hit the gym every day I'm on vacation. Usually I just end up sleeping and drinking beer.","Let's be naughty and save Santa the trip.","I'll fill those canyons in your soul, like a river lead you home. And I'll walk a step behind, in the shadows so you shine. Just ask, it will be done and I will prove my love, until you're sure that I'm the one.","Sometimes if a song hits me really good the first time, I get sick of it. And by the 10th time I've heard it, it's just candy, and I don't like it anymore.","I'm really private, and also, when I'm home, I'm home. I don't like people in on my business. I believe that you can be overexposed.","No matter who you meet in life, you take something from them, positive or negative.","I think you need to do something new to keep reinventing yourself.","I don't want to hear songs about how sunshiny things are. I don't like songs that feel like radio candy... I like the ones that make you think, laugh or cry - they pull some kind of emotion out of you.","Shoot, there's a committee to tell you everything at a record label. You definitely have to know who you are if you want to look like you at the end of the process. We've all seen people get record contracts, and by the time they're spit out by the machine, we don't even recognize them.","I really like the old stuff that I cut my musical teeth on, and I loved it when the industry was just like that, without really a genre. Today, country radio's more aimed at a demographic than a genre. It just softens everything.","I've had fans come and knock on my door. I'm usually polite, but I'm usually very direct and say, 'It's not cool that you come here uninvited.'","Anytime something starts to feel like a popularity contest or not about the music, I'd rather just not be involved. I'm not a big high-fiver. That really gets to people around me when we have a No. 1 or something big happen. I'm not a big, 'Let's go have a party about it!'","We sat around and I fed them barbecue and whiskey. And pretty soon everyone started to compete with each other on the guitars. It seemed the more everyone drank and ate, the more everyone got into it.","I've never listened to an album once I've finished it. All I hear is what I should've done different. I beat myself up over it.","Country was about character. Country's changed because of monsters like Clear Channel who bought up all the stations and sliced them up into formats. Our demographic is now the soccer mom.","I love the road. That's always been my goal. I've said that to many record labels. I want to make records. The road is my favorite. Some people hate the road, I love the road.","Everything about the music industry takes away from you as an artist. They're always wondering what the next thing is: 'What do you have?' It's a very introverted process.","It's always performing for me. I write and I record so I can perform. It all ties to that. I've done it since I was a little kid. That's my absolute rush, is playing for different people every night, bringing something else to the table they've never seen.","I've always said I've wanted to be around forever. I never wanted to be the latest, greatest thing. I want to be like Willie Nelson - touring when I'm 70. To do that, you can't be the latest, greatest thing because those things fizzle out.","If you're truly in a band and you guys have been together for a long time, there's a family bond that you have. In fact, I've talked about this with therapists, especially if you're talking about a relationship, because when you're with somebody, you're going to your family, and she's alone.","If you date a musician, you're never, ever really gonna be first either. You're gonna be right behind the music and maybe right close.","If you come on my property, I've got you from the second that you enter on. There's little lasers... my TVs come on in my room and fall just right on you. So, there's no way to sneak up on me. And I've got a loud dog.","My whole back's tattooed. I just wanted a twist. I was always in punk bands when I was little... I think that's where the tie comes from.","When all your stuff gets smashed, everybody gives you new stuff. And when you've been playing the same guitar since you were like 12, that's a lot like dancing with somebody else's wife.","I love the intimacy of venues like the House of Blues. When everyone is packed in and so close to you, it makes you play differently. It's so much more fun to play because there's so much more high energy in a place like that.","I am so anti-people's opinions when I'm making a record, but when it's finished and I put it out there, I hope somebody likes it.","When you take other people's opinions, you end up flailing and you have no center.","When my wife passed, I stopped doing interviews and I stopped doing meet-and-greets, mostly because I sort of became this suicide ambassador. Everybody wanted to tell me their story.","I think the real problem is that nobody buys albums anymore, so you don't get the depth of the artists that are out today. What you get is whatever they felt is politically correct to get on there and actually make some impact. I think that's where you're losing your depth. You're only getting the very top of everything. It really bothers me.","To me, country music's about life. It's about Monday through Friday. It's the blue-collar, 40-hour week, songs about life. It used to have more of a sound, but I think the heart of that's still the same. It's still American music.","I try to write relevant songs about life and whatever I'm going through and whatever people are going through.","I try never to focus on the radio, just find great songs, find emotion and just write the best songs you can. I think when you get fixated on trying to do something too accurate, it becomes more washed out and less what you intended it to be. So I think each time the challenge for me is to try and reinvent a little bit."],"Gary Barlow":["I'm not a good time-off person. I'm awful on holiday. It comes from having that period when I didn't work. That really was the worst bit.","It wasn't not being famous any more, or even not being a recording artist. It was having nobody who needed me, no phones ringing, nothing to do. Because I'm still too young to do nothing. I was only 24 when all that happened. Now, at 40, I feel I've got more to give than I ever have.","I might do 'X Factor' next year. It's looking good that I won't get the sack at Christmas.","I quite like being who I am.","I don't think you'll ever be happy about anything unless you've done it.","The trouble with the artists this year is they are all obsessed with Twitter and headlines. It feels like they are all getting a bit above themselves.","We are constantly reminding them that they are in a competition. I had a word with all my contestants and I know Kelly Rowland had a word with hers. It's reality check time.","We are all lucky to be here, we are lucky to be on stage and have millions of people watch us.","I don't think any of us can compete with Cowell. He is the best at what he does."],"Gary Bauer":["Empathy is a virtue, but it should not be a guiding judicial principle.","Americans have not only a right but a responsibility to consider the values of those who seek to lead them - whether they arise from life experience, political ideology or religious belief.","Republicans rarely criticize Obama for lack of empathy - in part because liberals have traditionally been seen as standing up for the weak and the vulnerable. Conservatives can be just as empathetic. But they believe that, in most cases, it's not government's role to be the primary dispenser of empathy.","Enhanced interrogation is not to be considered lightly, but the use of enhanced interrogation techniques does not require moral people to abandon their beliefs. Rather, it is precisely during these difficult times that one's beliefs about life, justice and mercy become indispensible.","The abortion industry can try to improve its 'messaging' all it wants. But unless abortion advocates change their devotion to abortion-on-demand, the only message Americans will receive is that the abortion industry is only really interested in improving its bottom line at the expense of the most defenseless among us.","Today's children are taught by our culture that we are a cosmic accident. Something slithered out of the primal slime and over billions of years evolved into a human being. We are cousins, ten times removed, to the ape at the zoo eating his own excrement.","If Republicans are aiming for the heart, for compassion, the last thing they should do is abandon the sanctity of life. Instead, they should tell Americans that they believe in the dignity and value of every human being, from the defenseless unborn child, to the newborn with a disability, to the 90-year-old dealing with dementia.","I think it would be bizarre to pick somebody to speak at the convention based on their sexual preference, because once you go down that road, why don't you pick a transvestite?","Part of America's greatness is its willingness to care for those who are truly in need. But those who defraud the system take money and resources away not only from American taxpayers but also from those who truly need help.","When people move from poor countries to America, they quickly adapt in at least one way - their consumption habits.","Environmentalists have been outspoken in their support of smaller family size and abortion rights as keys to reducing global warming. But when it comes to immigration, the single biggest contributor to population growth in the industrial world, they stand largely silent.","The stigma that was once attached to things society deemed unhealthy served the purpose of making them undesirable. With the stigma gone, many people see little reason not to do whatever feels good at the moment.","Catholics and evangelicals need to remain allied, and in solidarity, against the increasingly aggressive secularism of our age.","In the continuing debate over the morality of enhanced interrogation, an essential consideration is often overlooked: intent.","All of my judges will want to welcome every child into the world, give them a place at the table.","I believe if more American children read the Ten Commandments and are taught what they mean, they will predictably engage in less crime.","As President, I will end once and for all the use of taxpayer funds to promote the National Endowment for the Arts and other programs that subsidize amoral and degrading activities.","When the penalty for a policeman's mistake is to put a criminal back out on the street, then we are hurting America; we are hurting our law-abiding citizens.","I'm against big bureaucracy in Washington making health care decisions. I just have an aversion to bureaucrats. But it's not just government bureaucrats. I don't like HMO bureaucrats and insurance company bureaucrats either.","All the culture war issues will be settled by the court.","As long as there's land available, single-family homes will be built, and Colorado residents will always go for a single-family over a condo.","I'm pro-death penalty, but what I have not seen is anybody that would mock someone on death row.","It seems that the only gun violence some leftists approve of is gun violence aimed at cops and other groups they see as oppressive or racist.","Some on the Left can be very selective about the kinds of violence they oppose. For some of them, gun violence is a crime to be decried - unless it is committed by an 'aggrieved' victim against what they consider a corrupt institution.","There is something wrong with our culture when the view that marriage is between one man and one woman, a view shared by half the nation, is portrayed as evidence of hatred.","Democratic politicians, liberal activists and liberal news outlets routinely deploy incendiary rhetoric and wicked accusations to marginalize Republicans.","Liberals need to take the advice they routinely give to conservatives: that there are consequences to their divisive rhetoric, and that in their attempts to score political points, they are also inciting violence.","It's important for American soldiers to be culturally sensitive when deployed in foreign countries. But it's just as important for the U.S. never to renounce the most fundamental American values, which, after all, are also universal values.","Presidents have the right to nominate their own cabinet secretaries. But their nominees don't have a right to confirmation. Senators have a constitutional duty to advise and consent to the appointment of all Cabinet officials. They should take that duty seriously.","More and more political analysts and weak-kneed politicians are advising the historically pro-life Republican Party to abandon its pro-life stance for political gain. My first response is that if you cannot trust a party on the value of defending human life, how can you trust it on issues like marginal tax rates?","The Founders believed liberty came directly from God. With their knowledge of Scripture, they knew each child was made in the image of God. That is why everyone had dignity, value and worth.","When a young man massacres innocents, we have been trained to believe that the act was due to improper levels of chemical enzymes and misfiring synapses. As we learn more about our cells, we forget more about our souls.","Having robbed children of any sense that their Father is in Heaven and that they are His creation, we then launched an experiment in raising them without earthly fathers too. Having neither a Father in heaven or a father in the home, many young men make gangs their families.","I have no problem with any gay group that says they're Republicans, but I will fight them tooth and nail if they try to change what the Republican Party believes.","Beyond politics, the West is suffering from what can be called a crisis of brokenness - broken institutions, broken families and broken souls.","One thing everyone seems to agree on is that Republicans face a perceived compassion deficit.","If Republicans want to be seen as more compassionate, they should continue to stand proudly for the sanctify of life and marriage. And they should do so without apologizing.","When it comes to social issues, Republicans don't just need to be more empathetic. They also need to be more emphatic in explaining to voters what they believe, and why.","The science of life is changing hearts and minds.","Newt Gingrich is one of the brightest people in the Republican Party and he's always been a little unorthodox in his approach to politics, but that's what makes him Newt Gingrich.","I have come to the conclusion that while a candidate's faith matters, what's most important is how he or she applies that faith.","The question Americans should ask is not whether a candidate is affiliated with a particular faith but rather whether that candidate's faith makes it more likely he or she will support policies that align with their values.","It's important to ask candidates about their beliefs, in part because politicians frequently exploit religious faith - often with the idea that voters will be more likely to unthinkingly accept certain political positions so long as they arise from religious belief.","Big-government proponents embrace both the power of the federal government and the idea that millions of Americans ought to be dependent on its largesse. It's time to return to our Founders' love for small government. More is not always better.","As a conservative, I maintain a healthy skepticism of the theory of man-made global warming. I also believe that more people enjoying the fruits of modernity and economic development is a good thing - as long as those people arrived legally and obey the law.","Obama often criticizes policies that place the interests of the powerful ahead of the powerless. But through his administration's support of abortion rights, Obama shows his lack of empathy for society's most powerless.","There's a lot of people out now around America who depend on checks from their fellow taxpayers being in the mailbox every day.","Particularly black Americans, many of them, from quotes that I have seen and conversations I've had, are sort of insulted that the civil rights movement is being hijacked - the rhetoric of the civil rights movement is being hijacked for something like same sex marriage. Black Americans tend to have a higher degree of religiosity.","My argument is simple, which is, that for several thousand years in Western civilization, marriage has been the union of one man and one woman. Research is overwhelming that children need mothers and fathers.","If one is going to change the definition of marriage to be, quote, 'same sex,' then there is absolutely no valid argument constitutionally or rhetorically you can make against multiple people getting married. These are radical social changes.","Obviously, marriage is not a synonym for morality. But stable marriages and families do encourage moral behavior.","America used to have a strong 'moral safety net' for its people. Today that net is badly frayed, not only because families are disintegrating but also because the church doesn't play the same role that it once did in many Americans' lives.","Guided by nothing but pop culture values, many children no longer learn how to think about morality and virtue, or to think of them at all. They grow up with no shared moral framework, believing that the highest values are diversity, tolerance and non-judgmentalism.","The Left regards the Constitution as defective and outmoded - in part because it impedes the government's ability to control institutions, like churches and families, which stand between the state and individuals.","'Fairness' can be an important quality for legislators to consider when they are passing public policies. But it is a subjective standard. And it has no place among judges on a court - whose duty is to dispassionately judge a law's constitutionality.","For the record, I believe elected officials should talk about faith. Our founders believed the moral principles of faith were indispensable to our nation's survival. The Declaration of Independence mentions God four times.","Republican values - strong families, faith, personal responsibility and freedom, among others - are not unique to specific subsets of the electorate. They are universal values, and it is Republicans' job to remind Americans of that fact.","Independence doesn't - doesn't equate to moderates. Millions of independents are pro-life. Millions of independents believe marriage is between a man and a woman."],"Gary Becker":["Still, intuitive assumptions about behavior is only the starting point of systematic analysis, for alone they do not yield many interesting implications.","My work on human capital began with an effort to calculate both private and social rates of return to men, women, blacks, and other groups from investments in different levels of education.","I was not sympathetic to the assumption that criminals had radically different motivations from everyone else.","A stronger yuan could lead to greater Chinese asset accumulation in the U.S. and elsewhere.","Fines are preferable to imprisonment and other types of punishment because they are more efficient. With a fine, the punishment to offenders is also revenue to the State.","The Treatise tries to analyze not only modern Western families, but also those in other cultures and the changes in family structure during the past several centuries.","Why in almost all societies have married women specialized in bearing and rearing children and in certain agricultural activities, whereas married men have done most of the fighting and market work?"],"Gary Bettman":["I never rule anything in or out; life can surprise you.","I couldn't do what I do day-in and day-out if I didn't love the game.","You can have the biggest markets in the world, but if the game isn't exciting, compelling, and competitive, it's not going to generate a lot of interest.","I think the media world is adjusting to the digital age.","We're certainly not in position to expand into the East. We've been very candid and up front that if, in fact, we go through an expansion process, the world will know about it.","I think there's always a line between what is parody in good fun in chanting and what is intended to belittle certain segments of society.","We went from journalism, in newspapers that gets heavily edited, to blogs, where you can express your opinions, to tweeting, where you can say anything, and it gets repeated and becomes fact when it isn't. It's something the entire world is going to have to come to grips with.","It takes two sides to make a deal, two sides to negotiate and two sides to make it go bad.","We don't tell the officials to change the standard for the playoffs, but as we all know, time and space tends to evaporate very quickly in a playoff game; there tends to be a lot more physicality and a lot more adjustments in the course of a series.","The Canadian franchises and Canada as a market for NHL hockey has always been a priority for us.","I think it's fairly clear that playing hockey isn't the same as playing football.","I think there needs some attention to be paid to what sport is going to represent to young people: should it be viewed in the competitive, team-oriented sense that it is now, or does it become a vehicle for betting, which may, in effect, change the atmosphere in the stadiums and the arenas?","On the issue of behavioral health and the like, the program we have in place has always been available to former players as well.","We did the World Cup to relaunch our international efforts, and that served as a foundation.","Fighting is one of those things that gets tons of attention, far more than it deserves.","I don't worry about the integrity of the game. Our players are professionals.","If you want to know how I feel, I'll summarize it in one word - terrible.","My message to the kids and our fans is hockey's a great game. There's a lot of hockey being played at all levels. Get involved, do it. We will be back and we will be back better than ever and hopefully as soon as possible. Don't give up on the game. It's too good.","Our economics are not baseball's economics. Our game is not baseball's game. Our owners are not baseball's owners, with one or two exceptions. Our union is not baseball's union. What we do has to be crafted and suited to address hockey, to address the NHL, to address our 30 teams and our 700-plus players.","There's no question that the Kings have been, are, and can be great hosts for any major events.","There are lots of come-from-behind wins, games getting tied in the last period, teams going on to win. That, I think, tells the best story. Whether or not some teams have more grit, better chemistry, or more luck or more skill, it's still within the parameters. I think that makes for great storytelling and great interest for our fans.","Market size, particularly when you're dealing with major media markets, has an impact in terms of gathering attention.","I don't weigh into politics.","The Olympics are very proprietary about letting others promote and market what's going on, so we shut down for 17 days, and they don't let us do a whole lot in return for giving our players to them. We don't get compensated, and we've never looked for compensation.","I don't feel that it's either necessary or appropriate for me to comment on what the NFL either says or does.","Eliminating fighting would mean eliminating the jobs of the 'fighters,' meaning these guys would not have NHL careers.","The relationship between concussions and the asserted clinical symptoms of C.T.E. remains unknown.","Let's put it this way: I would consider my skiing ability to be far superior to my skating ability. And, in fact, my 10-year-old grandson, who's a AAA squirt, can skate circles around me.","My rooting interest these days is first and foremost competitive hockey, and secondly in officials not making a mistake.","From as early as I can remember, I was focused on becoming a lawyer.","I don't really think about having a retrospective on my high-school years. It's not something that, from a positive or a negative standpoint, is a driving force in my life.","NHL clubs have not wanted to go to the Olympics, and we have been saying that for months if not years.","NHL clubs don't like having to shut down at a critical part of the season and disrupt our season for anything, let alone a situation where we're not given an opportunity to promote our presence.","At least two or three of the leagues in Europe over the last few months have said to us, 'We hope you go to the Olympics,' and I looked at them, and I said, 'Why?' and they go, 'Because if you don't send NHL players, we have to send our players, and that's way too disruptive to our season.'","If the IOC would move the Olympic hockey tournament to the summer, that would be great. We'd be thrilled to have our players participate because then it doesn't affect our season.","A good fan base has developed around the Hurricanes, and I see the opportunity for continued growth for this franchise in the future.","I don't see the Hurricanes relocating, period. I think the Triangle is a terrific market.","Sports, as a media property, is increasingly valuable because it's something you have to have live. As a result, we're a better touch point for sponsors and advertisers because our commercials typically don't get zapped out.","Whatever you do needs to be sustainable over time, and taking the money in the short term and taking it in a bubble - like buying an Internet stock in 2000 - may not be sustainable.","Because of the way my words get scrutinized, I have to use a level of precision so people don't accuse me of misleading them.","What you want to do, particularly when you're dealing with a professional sports league and franchises and people's passionate commitment to the game and for the team they root for is, it has to be sustainable.","I think it's very difficult to generalize as to why, in a particular league or a particular industry, somebody has or has not come out. We certainly don't want a player to come out for our sake. It should be what's right for him and something that he has to be comfortable with.","I think it's our job to create a culture and an environment where a gay player knows he is safe and welcome. If and when that happens, believe me - that person will have the full support of the commissioner's office.","I believe, certainly in the NHL, a player who can help a team win because he can contribute on the ice is going to be coveted whatever his beliefs may be or whoever he may be. That goes to national origin, religious beliefs, or sexuality.","What we have tried to instill across the league through ownership and management is that we stand for inclusiveness and to judge somebody on the merits.","Doing jersey advertising for the World Cup is not in the same universe as putting advertising on NHL sweaters.","The issue of how the game is played is something that's constantly being reviewed internally with the Players' Association, with the general managers, and it's something that we continue to monitor on a daily basis.","I believe that the Greater Phoenix Area is a terrific sports market; it's a terrific hockey market.","To be the organization that we want to be, we have to have a place to play.","We are not giving up on the Coyotes in the Greater Phoenix Area... The team has got a number of options and is going to pursue them, so nobody should think that team is moving other than out of Glendale.","The good news for us is the NHL has never been stronger, never been more popular, and that, I guess, has led to a lot of interest being expressed from a number of places, an interest in getting an expansion team, and Las Vegas happens to be one of those places.","We don't want our players getting hurt.","I think it's fair to say that all of the teams that have been in the playoffs have played very physically.","There are a couple people who have complained on other teams about some of the things that Pittsburgh players have done. Some of that goes in the category of gamesmanship. Some of that goes to the fact that we need to be vigilant as a league to make sure that players aren't unnecessarily and inappropriately hurt.","All have used the economic opportunity of a new arena project to transform their cities into the future.","I'm having trouble understanding why there hasn't been further progress on CalgaryNext.","You don't want people rooting for anything other than the team that they love and the players that they think the world of to win. We don't want there to be another agenda.","Relatively, a very small percentage of betting takes place on hockey and even baseball because of the nature of the game and the scoring.","While we know gambling is part of the industry in Las Vegas, we're not going to make it all that easy for you to pick up a ticket, a gambling ticket, on your way into the arena.","We're concerned how gambling and betting affects the NHL game and changes the perception of and challenges the integrity of the NHL game.","I think that when somebody loses a bet, they tend to sometimes confuse their motives in rooting and enjoying the game because if you lose your bet, even though the team you're rooting for wins, you have a potentially conflicted outcome.","We don't worry about the integrity of our game. I'm more focused on the atmosphere in the arena, and that's something we're comfortable with going forward.","I don't think taunting chants at players on the other side of the ice is intended to be sexist in the slightest. It's like when you call a goaltender a sieve, they chant that. Is that now inappropriate also?","We encourage the growth of women's hockey.","Our franchises have never been healthier. Our league, in terms of its economic footing, has never been healthier.","Young people, particularly in their teens and 20s, are not consuming sports the way my generation did. They are doing lots of things; they are multitasking. They are getting downloads; they are getting alerts on their computers or on their cellphones, and they are consuming sports in a more real-time but less full-time basis.","I would hope there would be a greater appreciation by casual sports fans of the incredible skill and passion of our players.","We'll have clinics and educational events and conferences to get more and more young players developing as hockey players.","While players say they like the five-day break, they're also saying they don't like the compression that goes along with it, and that's something that is of great concern to us as well.","Obviously, we're focused on the Winter Classic.","None of our series are ever static in terms of the dates. We always have a range of flexibility to respond to whatever may or may not happen.","We just want to see entertaining, exciting games, and we want the officials to do a good job.","It's not about big markets or small markets. It's not about dominant teams or not. It's about the actual competition and how good the games are, how good the series turn out. That's what I think is the most important for fans.","When you're in other time zones in other places, you don't get quite as much attention; you don't get quite as much visibility for the game, and you give up a lot to do it.","Our sport probably has the best history and tradition of being engaged in international competition.","I was always a fan of the game, and I wouldn't have taken this job if I wasn't a fan of the game.","There is less fighting in the game than we had years ago. I mean, we penalize it.","Having to respond to things that are made up or untrue tends to be a waste of time.","I view myself as a dealmaker.","I'm not here to win a popularity contest.","If you're a sports fan, it is really cool when you see the best-on-best for hockey at the Olympics.","I know when you're in the business of cover sports, you look for 60-minute games and a result. It's never that simple.","The Steelers run a great organization.","When you look at the team that Jimmy Rutherford has put together and the players that he has, this is just a great story of excellent in professional sports.","What our fans want, what our fans believe, what our fans are interested in is why we are what we are. But, nevertheless, ultimately we have to do the things that we believe are essential for the long-term health of the game, of the league, and of all of our franchises.","The fact is, I view part of what I do is, if necessary, on difficult issues, be the lightning rod.","If you're thin-skinned, you don't belong doing what I do for a living.","There are always going to be critics... and I have always had a rule: no matter how good the commentary is, or how bad the commentary is, it's more important that you do what you think is right.","In '94, we made the deal during collective bargaining that wasn't the right deal, just to save the season. Allowing the 'in the crease' rule, the foot-in-the-crease rule, we should have not done.","We're not anti-Olympics, we're anti-disruption to the season."],"Gary Burghoff":["The 'M*A*S*H' cast loves each other with unconditional love; our domestic animals love us with unconditional love.","I've discovered that the standard all-American dream of fame and fortune is not success for me. Success for me is simply the joy of working - doing good work - and then bringing that joy home to my family. But if what I do in my work doesn't enrich my life with my family, I'm doing the wrong thing.","The best compliment we ever got about the show was from a Korean veteran who was unable to talk about his war experience with his wife until 'M*A*S*H.' While watching the show, he was able to lean over to his wife and say, 'See, honey, that's the way it was.'","I'm just a Connecticut country boy. The people I've known, the changes of season, the call of the blue jay - when I'm away, all of them haunt me.","I don't vote for the guy I trust. I vote for the guy who trusts me the most.","I was just a kid, but I was a rotten kid.","My son gave me the permission to accept my success.","I am offered work all the time but not for TV series.","It's awfully nice when people thank you for the pleasure and laughter you've brought to their lives.","There is no such thing as going on to something bigger and better than 'M*A*S*H' because there is nothing bigger and better. I have done the best I can do, and been in the best I could be in on television - with the best people.","The richest people are those who have life arranged so they have food for the family and the rent or mortgage paid. After that, at least in my case, it can become a pretty boring existence if wealth is the only objective."],"Gary Burton":["I think I always have been someone who likes to push at the edges of things, looking for something different.","It keeps me in touch with younger musicians who are constantly saying, 'Have you heard this new artist, or this new guitar player?' It keeps you reaching.","I felt like I was a teacher. But nowadays, I am as much a student of his. He writes a lot of what we play.","Certainly one of the more common experiences in the jazz field is discovering someone new. Improvising musicians are capable of being musical travelers, voyagers. We want to join in on whatever we hear. There is a freedom to wander the musical landscape.","I've made more than 50 records with a wide range of music. I've often veered to check something out.","It hasn't been hard getting nominated, but winning it is another thing. The competition is tough.","I grew up in a farm town in Indiana. In the early years I played by myself, because there were no other musicians around.","I was surprised when I finally moved to Boston and the East Coast, to discover that there weren't that many vibraphone players around. And I was the only one playing with four mallets.","I was a big fan of Jim Hall as well. I liked his comping style, his accompanying. And that he played, generally, four note chords, the top four strings of the guitar.","But if you listen to great piano players, both classical and jazz, there's a huge range of dynamics and colors and emotional expression that's possible with the instrument.","I know of musicians who have played together for decades who hate each other. The Modern Jazz Quartet for one.","There are a few things that I will hopefully be credited for as a pioneer. One is my four-mallet playing. Another one is the starting what was first called jazz rock in 1967 when I started my first band, later became jazz fusion by the 1970s.","I've discovered all kinds of music and done all kinds of music over the past 40 years, from playing tango with Piazzolla to all the different bands I've had.","Most people learn to improvise on their own, listening to records, endless hours of noodling on their instrument in the bedroom with all their spare time. That's traditionally how people learn."],"Gary Busey":["My dark side, my shadow, my lower companion is now in the back room blowing up balloons for kids' parties.","If you take shortcuts, you get cut short.","I've been told by doctors and surgeons that I have the energy of ten men who have normal jobs.","Imagine the peace symbol. The peace symbol has three pieces in it. One piece is emotion, that's your body. Another piece has spirit in it, that's your fuel. Another piece has intellect in it and that's your steering wheel. You can never overdo the fuel that goes into the body, which is the emotions and the steering wheel to drive it.","I'm not jealous, and I'm not possessive, and I'm not controlling.","There has got to be more to life than being a really, really, ridiculously good actor.","I love love, and I love life. I love. I just love. It's just great. It's the most enduring element we have is love.","Nothing changes like changes, because nothing changes but the changes.","It's a very strange silence that I'm living in right now. It's a silence that has a lot of activity and noise in it from a zone that I don't live in on this earth.","You know what 'FAILING' stands for? It stands for 'Finding An Important Lesson, Inviting Needed Growth.'","Never dip lower than you can dip.","Fear is the dark room where the Devil develops his negatives.","Amen is not the end of a prayer, it just gets us ready to go to the next level.","It's good for everyone to understand that they are to love their enemies, simply because your enemies show you things about yourself you need to change. So in actuality enemies are friends in reverse.","You know what 'DOUBT' stands for? It stands for 'Debate On Understanding Bewildersome Thoughts.'","Have a mind that's open to everything, get attached to nothing.","I'm interested in all things that Donald Trump does. I've known him since 1980. He's a good man.","I'll tell you this: You have to remember to chase and catch your dreams, because if you don't, your imagination will live in empty spaces, and that's nowhere land.","I consider myself a Texan. I grew up in Texas and Oklahoma.","Winners do what losers don't want to do.","I don't know where I come from but I'm here now so deal with it.","I don't know how I got involved in 'Celebrity Wife Swap.' It came from my agent Hugh. He got the opportunity for me."],"Gary Calamar":["The big difference between the radio show and the TV work is that I don't have to work by committee on the radio show. I'm the DJ; I can play what I want and suffer or get praised by that. With a TV show, it's much more of a collaboration, and the song that I might think is perfect may get shot down and vice versa.","I love iTunes as much as anybody. It's very convenient and very easy. But there is nothing like the vibe that you get when you walk into a record store. And I think a lot of people are still thrilled to spend a half hour there and go through the bins and make some purchases.","I definitely love record stores. And worked in many over the years. Having said that, it's not necessarily that I love vinyl per se. I mean, I'm happy to use CDs and MP3s: to me, it's the music that's top priority. I do have a good collection of vinyl, but I rarely actually pull it out.","Whenever I go to a new city, whether visiting or vacationing, I would always make that a point to get to the record store early on, just to get my bearings and see what was going on around town.","I worked in Licorice Pizza when John Lennon was killed. I had the day off, but I came in anyway because people needed a place to mourn.","Iggy Pop, or should I say Iggy's people, had reached out to me saying he was a True Blood fan, and if any opportunities come up, to please keep Iggy in mind. We sent Iggy the demo of 'LB&R'. He loved it and said, 'Sign me up.'","It's a great meeting place, community center, art gallery, singles bar, music venue. The record store really covers a lot of ground.","Certainly, R.E.M. grew out of the Wuxtry record store in Athens, where Peter Buck was working and Michael Stipe came in to visit. And even their later manager, Bertis Downs, they all met and congregated at that record store. So I'm sure we wouldn't see those without the record store.","The first purchase I made with my own money was a single by The Kinks, \"All Day and All of the Night\" and still one of my all time favorites."],"Gary Carr":["I studied the lives of jazz singers who would tour Europe, and... what I learned was life was big ride for them. They'd seen the dark side of humanity... but touring the world playing jazz, it was a truly carefree way of living. A great escapism, if you like.","I love the States and their attitudes about entertainment.","It's always nice when people say nice things or are complimentary.","I love accents. It's a great way to separate yourself when playing a role.","Michael Kitchen was a great person to work with. So attentive and just great at what he does and supportive, also."],"Gary Carter":["I got that nickname my first spring training camp with the Expos in 1974. Tim Foli, Ken Singleton and Mike Jorgensen started calling me 'Kid' because I was trying to win every sprint. I was trying to hit every pitch out of the park.","I like mellow music. I like some jazz. But I'm not a big hard rock guy.","To be 49 years old now and still be called The Kid, that's kind of special.","It's kind of a tradition that you get a rookie, put him in the middle, wrap your arms and legs around him, then douse him with everything you can get a hold of - shaving cream, ketchup, mustard, everything. It's kind of like a pie in the face after a guy is successful.","That's what every young kid thinks about when they first put on a uniform - is to play in the Major League and then, ultimately, play in a World Series. To me, that was the ultimate, winning in '86.","There's a place in my heart for every team I played on.","I remember many a time, going into someplace like Wrigley Field - where you could cut the humidity with a knife - and playing a doubleheader. I loved to play the game. It didn't matter if it was a doubleheader, or a single game, or a day game after a night game. I wanted to play.","There were probably a few games I played where I should not have played, because of some nagging injuries or something. I used to always talk the managers into playing me, because I wanted to play so badly.","I tried the broadcasting thing, the coaching thing, but I'll never replace the competitive feeling of being out on the field when we were players.","I would love to get back to the big leagues as a coach, possibly a manager. I would love that opportunity.","My desires are simply I love to teach, I love to be in uniform, I love to throw batting practice, I love to be with the kids."],"Gary Chapman":["I think people desperately want to feel love.","I think that in today's world, by nature, we are all self-centered. And that often leads to selfishness.","I have been doing marriage counseling for about 15 years and I realized that what makes one person feel loved, doesn't make another person feel loved.","Love is reaching out to try to get to the other person."],"Gary Cherone":["When people don't get enough information, they make it up.","There is no substitute for jamming and getting to know each other on the road.","In my writing with Extreme, there are heavy themes. The cover photo has me with a gun to my neck. I am not advocating suicide. I am taking the philosophy that man is the measure of his own fate.","You have Extreme and Van Halen and the history that I have with other people I played with. There are some effects that will hopefully break that stereotype.","The voices on the record, that was trying to treat my voice like guitar players treat guitar tones.","If people get to the end of the record, then that is a treat.","I was growing up listening to Queen. Freddie Mercury threw those incredible melodies into his songs.","When I was in Van Halen I was hitting notes that were out of my range. I never went for those registers before until Eddie pulled it out of me.","Whether I sound like Sammy or not is purely coincidence. You have got to hand it to him, he sings his ass off. There is no moss on that stone.","Michael Anthony is the Diplomat of Rock N Roll. He is the regular guy.","It was fun while it lasted, but it never seemed real to me. I could not believe I was in Van Halen.","If I had had a chance to tour with Van Halen before the record, I think it would have been a different record.","You can tell the difference between songs that were created in a garage and songs that were created in the studio.","They hated Sammy Hagar for 12 years and they hate him to this day.","When 5150 came out rock was king. Post Nirvana and Pearl Jam 1996 is a different story.","Dave thought he was bigger than Van Halen the band. So there was this catfight going on for 10 years.","There is nothing like singing a song that 20,000 people know and are singing back to you.","I have a little history. I met Stone Temple Pilots, and their guitar player was a huge Extreme fan. Somewhere down the road, Extreme made its statement.","I am a big Pink Floyd fan. That is where a lot of the concept lyrics come from.","I don't know if I have enough guts to do a whole standard jazz record.","I did some research and tried to pull out some old, classic Van Halen that they had not played in 10 or 15 years. I think that was Sammy's mistake. I he didn't want to do the Dave stuff.","When I was singing Jamie's Cryin', people were going out of their mind because it was the first time they got to see Eddie, Michael and Alex play those songs. That was a thrill.","My favorite Extreme records were the last two. I can't listen to the first one.","We didn't gel with Poison and the Bon Jovi. Bon Jovi was the best of the pop metal bands, but we never fit in with the hair metal stuff. We were never as hip as the Chili Peppers. We were in the middle.","We weren't One Hit Wonders. We had a few hits.","I have had success throughout the years. Some of the hard rock bands today don't have the history that I have.","I sing in a higher register, and you haven't heard that on the radio in years.","Spitfire asked me if I had a problem talking about Van Halen or Extreme. I really don't. There are people who are just going to want to know what it was like to play with Eddie."],"Gary Clark, Jr.":["For a black male, the sound of the blues is pre-Civil Rights. It's oppression.","I failed public speaking in grade school, 'cause I was so nervous and scared.","The blues is the foundation for a lot of things. Things have branched off. It's cool how music grows, but the foundation is always there. It's not going anywhere. The blues is always going to be relevant.","There's so much music in Austin, and it's all so different.","I never expected to be approached for an ad campaign.","I know that I'm capable of moving around on the guitar. I can express myself the way I want to and feel good about it. But as far as technical chops, I'm not a learned musician.","My mom always told me I should have a Plan B. I said that if I'm not going to play guitar I'm going to play drums. And if I'm not going to play drums, I'm going to play bass. I always just wanted to play music. I was completely obsessed.","When I got my first guitar, I played along with everything I heard that had guitar in it, like the Ramones, Nirvana and Sublime, as well as whatever hip-hop and R&B stuff was on the radio.","I've been called 'musically schizophrenic,' and some people think that's a cool thing.","You could say I'm a laid-back kind of guy.","I'm somewhat of a hoarder. I keep everything.","The guys in my band buy instruments and sell and trade them. But if I have something I hang onto it. Everything is sentimental to me.","You know, I've never done karaoke, ever. It makes me nervous - I think it's the lack of the guitar and just a microphone.","Most of my songs start out as being very aggressive and guitar-driven.","I'm obsessed with fuzz pedals.","There's nothing like a music festival. People are ready to have a good time. I don't think anyone comes to a festival going, 'I'm gonna be a complete bummer today.'","When I was growing up, I would go hang out with older guys at night in blues clubs.","I don't think anything can touch the expressive range of the guitar.","I am the type of artist where you can't tell me anything. I have always been that way. I am right. I don't need any input."],"Gary Cohn":["Keep yourself motivated. You've got to be motivated, you've got to wake up every day and understand what that day is about; you've got to have personal goals - short term goals, intermediate goals, and long term goals. Be flexible in getting to those goals, but if you do not have goals, you will not achieve them.","Every time you get into a new job, new location, you have an amazing opportunity in front of you. You get to play dumb for as long as people will allow you to play dumb. You get to ask all the dumb questions, you get to ask multiple people the dumb questions, and you get to make mistakes. That's how you stand out in the crowd.","Upon graduation, believe it or not, I had no job. I had no interviews. I had no prospects. I had no worries. What I did have, I had passion. I had enormous passion. I had passion for financial markets. I had fallen in love with financial markets.","Have a goal. Know where you want to end up. Knowing where you want to end up is a lot easier than figuring out how to start and how to get there. You will figure out how to get there. Do not chart your career. Trust me; you do not want to chart your career.","Citizens standing up for equality and freedom can never be equated with white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and the KKK.","China is the big economic engine in Asia, so what happens is, as China growth expands, these countries in the periphery of China, whether it be Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, they end up growing with China because they become big exporters.","I don't think it's good for anyone to be in the public light - for negative reasons.","There is a finite group of major financial players... and overall, the best thing for all of us is to be in an industry that's well respected, well regarded, and well thought of.","I don't drink hot beverages.","I would like to get the tax rate as low as possible so that businesses want to create jobs here.","We want to keep a preferred rate for capital gains - we think it is important to encourage investment.","As a patriotic American, I am reluctant to leave my post as director of the National Economic Council because I feel a duty to fulfil my commitment to work on behalf of the American people.","Investment in America does not just benefit the United States - it benefits the world.","When our economy grows, it is good for the world. When the world economy grows, it is good for the United States.","Our belief in free markets and a level playing field are values that make the world more free, fair, and prosperous.","Gary Cohn doesn't care about the estate tax, I can guarantee you. I can guarantee you.","Many people are smart enough to know how to manage themselves out of the estate tax.","We do not believe that death should be a taxable event.","On the estate tax, if you look at the couple of groups who are the biggest advocates for repealing the estate tax, it really is the pass-through business, and it's the farmers.","When I look at myself, I have been - really - a lucky American to end up where I am.","I did get introduced to the financial markets while I was in college. And I think I learned also how to sort of filter out all of the nonrational, or nonsensible, noise and sort of concentrate on what matters, and that's really what markets are about.","If someone's getting a tax cut, I'm not upset that they're getting a tax cut. I'm really not upset.","The one trait in a lot of dyslexic people I know is that by the time we got out of college, our ability to deal with failure was very highly developed. And so we look at most situations and see much more of the upside than the downside.","I've thought about it many times, I really have, because it defined who I am. I wouldn't be where I am today without my dyslexia.","If we get a tax system that is competitive, we will hire people. When you hire people, you have to compete for labor. When you compete for labor, you drive wages.","We need to get a business tax system that makes us competitive to the rest of the world.","We spend millions of hours doing taxes and spend so much money doing our taxes. It should be very simple.","We want to go back to a tax system where Americans sit down at their kitchen table, and they do their taxes on a single sheet of paper. That's what we should have in this America.","The one thing you realize if you're going to be successful - no matter where you grew up, no matter what your educational level is - A. You can succeed, but B. The only way you're going to succeed is by outworking everyone else.","I was a horrible student.","I know from my experiences in life that educators had an enormous impact and influence on me. And fortunately or unfortunately, I had a lot of experience with different educators.","Going to school is not really education. It's really who's in front of the classrooms and who's endearing themselves to the kids and who's making the kids want to learn and who's inspiring them to be curious about any topic in the world.","Education is important. And the difference of the zip code you grow up in or the zip code you are born in and how you turn out really isn't fair to the kids of our world."],"Gary Cole":["I miss everything about Chicago, except January and February.","I love going to concerts, so that whole environment is something that intrigues me anyway.","When you make a movie, it's up to so many things and so many people.","You always know when something works it's a result of everything firing on all cylinders.","You can go out in a good movie and look bad as well.","I don't think anyone sets out to do something bad, it's just that it's very difficult.","Being able to fantasize for a couple of days at being a rock singer surpassed most things I've done on stage.","I think it had something to do with my love of music, especially rock music.","I still like to listen to the people that I came of age on.","I am also a drummer of sorts. I've got an electronic set sitting in my bedroom.","I messed around in high school, but I pretty much put it away until I did a television show in San Francisco.","I just don't eat too much. That's never been my problem.","Karl Malden was quite a mentor. He taught me things he had learned from being in front of a camera so long.","A lot of actors in my age bracket look at being still standing as pretty good.","You need someone to tell you how to do things like hitting your marks, or driving a car so it looks right or getting out of a car so it doesn't take a million years of screen time.","I will confess I did none of my own singing. I did all my own costume and makeup, though.","I like the fact that this kind of family has been seen in a movie a million times: teenage kids, the family is a bit strained and they don't have enough money, but in the background the guy used to be a Gene Simmons type.","If someone comes up to me, 90 percent of the time it's about Office Space.","I was a little nervous coming in mostly because my first scene was with Martin Sheen, who I'm a huge fan of.","I grew up with Apocalypse Now and Badlands, so I had a real awe thing going.","I was initially a leading man, but only on television.","Then, at some point, you get identified with certain things.","There is no handbook about how a career is going to go.","Yes, I've already done a couple of guest voices."],"Gary Coleman":["You can involve yourself in electronics, computers, puzzles... there's a lot of creativity and brain working. There's a lot to model trains that people don't realize.","I can see through almost any scam, especially one perpetrated by the federal government. I can see through it... they can't pull the wool over my eyes, it's absolutely freakin' impossible to pull the wool over my eyes about the government.","My slogan is I'm the least qualified guy for the job, but I'd probably do the best job.","I try to understand people who aren't as smart as me and not be hateful.","I don't have any friends and don't have any intention of making any. People will stab you in the back, mistreat you, talk about me behind your back, steal from you. And they're not really your friends. They're only there because you're a celebrity or because they want to get something from you.","I don't hurt or want for visibility, but people seem to forget pretty easily.","George W. Bush bought the election - period. End of story. There is no argument. You can try to come up with any argument you can, but there is none.","I can't sit back and swallow stuff. I live in a time and place, and in a country on earth where you're not supposed to swallow it. People just gave up.","I parody myself every chance I get. I try to make fun of myself and let people know that I'm a human being, and these things that have happened to me are real. I'm not just some cartoon who exists and suddenly doesn't exist.","I read Popular Mechanics, Popular Science, Reader's Digest... I read some responsible journalism, and from that, I form my own opinions. I also happen to be intelligent, and I question everything.","I still have the desire to do the job of acting. It's just a matter of whether I'll be allowed to do the job of acting that remains to be seen. There are only so many brick walls that I'm willing to beat my head on.","I have lifestyle requirements. Photos, meetings, lunches, dinners, facial care, tooth care. It requires an exorbitant amount of money.","I never got the opportunity to be romantic or feel romantic with anyone.","I would not give my first 15 years to my worst enemy.","I liked 'Diff'rent Strokes' up until about the last three or four years. I was bored.","I knew what normalcy was, and I wasn't having it.","I like to work.","I suffer a little bit from Napoleonism, if you will.","Politics is never about the people. It's about money. And wars. And how many heads you can step on and bodies you can step over. And I'm just not that kind of person.","I know the difference between true love and the love of my fans.","Television is fun, but it's hard, and if it gets too crazy I may just do it as a part-time thing.","I may like L.A., but I want to know when the seasons are.","Star Wars was magnificent, but you could tell Darth Vader's ships were glued together.","I have four strikes against me. I'm black, I'm short, I'm intelligent, and I have a medical condition."],"Gary Cooper":["In Westerns you were permitted to kiss your horse but never your girl.","The only achievement I am really proud of is the friends I have made in this community.","I looked it at like this way. To get folks to like you, as a screen player I mean, I figured you had to sort of be their ideal. I don't mean a handsome knight riding a white horse, but a fella who answered the description of a right guy.","The general consensus seems to be that I don't act at all."],"Gary David Goldberg":["It takes a lot of people to make a winning team. Everybody's contribution is important.","A good team, like a good show, comes into being when the separate individuals working together create, in essence, another separate higher entity - the team - the show - which is better than any of those individuals can ever be on their own.","I like to write scenes in the middle of the night. We could change every word of 'Family Ties' between Monday and Friday.","A lot of money eliminates a category of worry. If your car breaks down, you're still going to get through the day. But it doesn't make you a happy person if you weren't a happy person before.","You could put all of Rev. Jeremiah Wright's angry sermons on to one loop. You could put that loop up on the big screen at Radio City Music Hall and let it play there 24 hours a day, seven days a week and Barack Obama will still emerge as the next president of the United States.","'Family Ties' was a very successful situation comedy. And, in almost every respect, it functioned on a day to day basis like a well-run, well conditioned basketball team. The show was performed live each week in front of a studio audience on Friday night.","In 1998, I received treatment for my knee by an Israeli therapist. We spoke about Israel and I mentioned 'Scooterman' and he just froze. It was like he had met Elvis. I thought he was kidding me and then he called his brother, they yelled to each other over the phone, and then I believed him.","It was Nate Monaster who encouraged me to be a writer.","I was a guy who showed up for work and took the chance for finding out whether I could do it or not... I'd like to think I made my success not at the expense of anyone. Success was accidental.","Television is what it's always been. The best of times and the worst of times at the same time.","I think to the extent you die with money in the bank, you've miscalculated.","I don't sleep at night at all. Making movies is a marathon. I'm a good 100-yard-dash guy.","My father worked in the Post Office. A lot of double shifts. All his friends were in the same situation - truck drivers, taxi cab drivers, grocery clerks. Blue collar guys punching the clock and working long, hard hours. The thought that sustained them was the one at the center of the American dream.","At the end of the seven years, 'Family Ties' voluntarily went off the air. And, we went off as the #1 show on TV that week. We cut down the nets on stage 24 and moved on with the rest of our lives. Always to carry with us the blessing of what we had gone through together."],"Gary Dourdan":["I've never liked categories; I've never liked boxes; I've always tried to be unconventional as much as I possibly could.","I have to protect myself because people think that because you come into 25 million homes every week, they know you. I walk the line between being gracious and being rude.","When I did 'Alien: Resurrection', a lot of the guys worked on planned production, and one of them was really into comic books and would draw all sorts of characters, and I was impressed with his sketches."],"Gary Frank":["We've all read, I'm sure, a Superman book where we didn't really feel like we knew the character. Where the writer, often with the best of intentions, has tried put a personal stamp on the character, whether it be to try and make him more current, or cool, or have a broader appeal, etc.","I don't think anyone who has been to Africa comes away untouched by the place. You see a lot of beauty and optimism, but you also come away with an awareness of the huge gulf between what most of us have and what most of them have to make do with. Then, every now and then, a famine or a war makes everything a hundred times worse.","Christopher Reeve so completely inhabited the character Superman when he was in that costume, and that had such a huge effect on me as a child, watching those films back in the '70s. There was so much of that character that was, for me, Superman.","We can't do a modern Batman continually beating up thugs in zoot suits with tommy guns in violin cases. The game has to move on. It has to feel relevant.","For some reason, Superman seems to be held to higher standards on the subject of secret/super identities than other superheroes. No one ever says, 'Peter Parker was a nerdy kid. He can't possibly be Spider-Man, attract a good-looking gal, work in a newspaper, etc.' And no one gets hung up on whether his nerdiness is a disguise.","I think it's a mistake to try to pin down one particular reason for a person's personality. Don't we all, for many reasons, act differently in different circumstances and with different people?","The fact is that Superman isn't around because he is the oldest superhero. He's still around because he is a great superhero. He's the guy that spawned the entire genre, and that didn't happen because it was a mediocre idea.","When Captain America is in a room full of Marvel superheroes, he is always Top Dog, even though his powers are pretty modest. He could be stood next to Thor, Iron Man, whoever. He is the one that everyone looks up to. To me, that is Superman, too. Even de-powered in the Legion arc, he was still Superman. Still Top Dog."],"Gary Glitter":["I have an incomplete album that I want to finish. I have been thinking about the plan during my days in jail, I have sung rock n' roll for forty years. After jail, I will continue to rock n' roll.","I have done my time living on the run. I'm British and I want to come home."],"Gary Goetzman":["The problem with some stars is that they lose perspective about correct adult behavior. People laugh at everything they say and do. Nobody says, 'Chill out, man. That's out of line.'","Word of mouth is everything.","When you work with somebody, either the puzzle piece fits, or it doesn't.","We like to crystallize something in the audience's brain that makes them say, 'Hey I really want to watch that. I'm really interested in it.'","Is it ever too late for a sequel?","It's always hard to break an independent picture from the pack.","To think that guys who grew up in the '60s would make a miniseries supporting the idea that Oswald acted alone is something I certainly wouldn't have predicted. But time and evidence can change the way we view things.","In entertainment, there's a theory that you should be lunching and dinnering and going to some kind of power breakfast.","When dealing with HBO, you actually are dealing with real filmmakers.","No Afghans, as far as we know, have been involved in terrorist acts against our country. We shouldn't be swatting at hornets' nests we know nothing about."],"Gary Gygax":["Random chance plays a huge part in everybody's life.","There's a call to adventure. It's something in the inner psyche of humanity, particularly males.","There is no winning or losing, but rather the value is in the experience of imagining yourself as a character in whatever genre you're involved in, whether it's a fantasy game, the Wild West, secret agents or whatever else. You get to sort of vicariously experience those things.","The essence of a role-playing game is that it is a group, cooperative experience.","The secret we should never let the gamemasters know is that they don't need any rules.","Of course as children, we all, in all cultures and societies, learn behavior from observation, imitation, and encouragement of various kinds. So by the suggestion made, we all 'pretend' most of the time.","Somebody said they threw their copy of Dungeons and Dragons into the fire, and it screamed. It's a game! The magic spells in it are as real as the gold. Try retiring on that stuff.","I'm just a risk taker. I have gut instincts.","I foresee online gaming changing when there are good audio-visual links connecting the participants, thus approximating play in a face-to-face group.","When AI approximates Machine Intelligence, then many online and computer-run RPGs will move towards actual RPG activity. Nonetheless, that will not replace the experience of 'being there,' any more than seeing a theatrical motion picture can replace the stage play.","I wasn't popular in the home office because I wasn't chicken. I'm just a risk taker. I have gut instincts.","I hated school, didn't like the discipline.","Role-playing isn't storytelling. If the dungeon master is directing it, it's not a game.","Gaming in general is a male thing. It isn't that gaming is designed to exclude women. Everybody who's tried to design a game to interest a large female audience has failed. And I think that has to do with the different thinking processes of men and women.","Outside of the mindless sitcoms that the networks thrive on, people able to think generally consider most entertainment is escape in one form or another."],"Gary Hamel":["A noble purpose inspires sacrifice, stimulates innovation and encourages perseverance.","Trust is not simply a matter of truthfulness, or even constancy. It is also a matter of amity and goodwill. We trust those who have our best interests at heart, and mistrust those who seem deaf to our concerns.","Today, no leader can afford to be indifferent to the challenge of engaging employees in the work of creating the future. Engagement may have been optional in the past, but it's pretty much the whole game today.","Management innovation is going to be the most enduring source of competitive advantage. There will be lots of rewards for firms in the vanguard.","I live a half mile from the San Andreas fault - a fact that bubbles up into my consciousness every time some other part of the world experiences an earthquake. I sometimes wonder whether this subterranean sense of impending disaster is at least partly responsible for Silicon Valley's feverish, get-it-done-yesterday work norms.","In most organizations, change comes in only two flavors: trivial and traumatic. Review the history of the average organization and you'll discover long periods of incremental fiddling punctuated by occasional bouts of frantic, crisis-driven change.","You can't build an adaptable organization without adaptable people - and individuals change only when they have to, or when they want to.","As human beings, we are the only organisms that create for the sheer stupid pleasure of doing so. Whether it's laying out a garden, composing a new tune on the piano, writing a bit of poetry, manipulating a digital photo, redecorating a room, or inventing a new chili recipe - we are happiest when we are creating.","To escape the curse of commoditization, a company has to be a game-changer, and that requires employees who are proactive, inventive and zealous.","An adaptable company is one that captures more than its fair share of new opportunities. It's always redefining its 'core business' in ways that open up new avenues for growth.","Most of us understand that innovation is enormously important. It's the only insurance against irrelevance. It's the only guarantee of long-term customer loyalty. It's the only strategy for out-performing a dismal economy.","As the great grandchildren of the industrial revolution, we have learned, at last, that the heedless pursuit of more is unsustainable and, ultimately, unfulfilling. Our planet, our security, our sense of equanimity and our very souls demand something better, something different.","A titled leader relies heavily on positional power to get things done; a natural leader is able to mobilize others without the whip of formal authority.","In a well-functioning democracy, citizens have the option of voting their political masters out of office. Not so in most companies.","It doesn't matter much where your company sits in its industry ecosystem, nor how vertically or horizontally integrated it is - what matters is its relative 'share of customer value' in the final product or solution, and its cost of producing that value.","Power has long been regarded as morally corrosive, and we often suspect the intentions of those who seek it.","Fact is, inventing an innovative business model is often mostly a matter of serendipity.","An uplifting sense of purpose is more than an impetus for individual accomplishment, it is also a necessary insurance policy against expediency and impropriety.","To create an organization that's adaptable and innovative, people need the freedom to challenge precedent, to 'waste' time, to go outside of channels, to experiment, to take risks and to follow their passions.","The real damper on employee engagement is the soggy, cold blanket of centralized authority. In most companies, power cascades downwards from the CEO. Not only are employees disenfranchised from most policy decisions, they lack even the power to rebel against egocentric and tyrannical supervisors.","While one should never underestimate the ability of risk-besotted financiers to wreak havoc, the real threat to capitalism isn't unfettered financial cunning. It is, instead, the unwillingness of executives to confront the changing expectations of their stakeholders.","Like a child star whose fame fades as the years advance, many once-innovative companies become less so as they mature.","All too often, legacy management practices reflexively perpetuate the past - by over-weighting the views of long-tenured executives, by valuing conformance more highly than creativity and by turning tired industry nostrums into sacred truths.","I was frustrated for a long time with my colleagues in the business school world and with so many management authors who didn't really see themselves as innovators. They were glorified journalists.","You have to train people how to be business innovators. If you don't train them, the quality of the ideas that you get in an innovation marketplace is not likely to be high.","At the pinnacle of great design are products so gorgeous and lust-worthy that you want to lick them: a Porsche 911, Samsung's Luxia TV, an Eames lounge chair or anything by Loro Piana.","An enterprise that is constantly exploring new horizons is likely to have a competitive advantage in attracting and retaining talent.","The biggest barriers to strategic renewal are almost always top management's unexamined beliefs.","An employee who's one of hundreds, rather than one of a few, is unlikely to feel personally responsible for helping the organization adapt and change.","I'm a capitalist by conviction and profession. I believe the best economic system is one that rewards entrepreneurship and risk-taking, maximizes customer choice, uses markets to allocate scarce resources and minimizes the regulatory burden on business.","I am an ardent supporter of capitalism - but I also understand that while individuals have inalienable, God-given rights, corporations do not.","Most companies don't have the luxury of focusing exclusively on innovation. They have to innovate while stamping out zillions of widgets or processing billions of transactions.","During the ten years I lived in the U.K., I frequently attended an Anglican church just outside of London. I enjoyed the energetic singing and the thoughtful homilies. And yet, I found it easy to be a pew warmer, a consumer, a back row critic.","Truth be told, there are lots of companies that provide exemplary phone support. DirecTV, Virgin America and Apple are a few that regularly exceed my expectations.","Building human-centered organizations doesn't imply a return to the paternalistic, corporate welfare practices of the 19th century. Most of us don't want to be nannied.","When a politician bends the truth or a CEO breaks a promise, trust takes a beating.","It's not just that individuals have lost faith in the integrity of their leaders, it's that they no longer believe society's most powerful institutions are acting in their interests.","Remarkable contributions are typically spawned by a passionate commitment to transcendent values such as beauty, truth, wisdom, justice, charity, fidelity, joy, courage and honor.","If corporate leaders and their acolytes are not slaves to some meritorious social purpose, they run the risk of being enslaved by their own ignoble appetites.","In a world of commoditized knowledge, the returns go to the companies who can produce non-standard knowledge.","It's important to remember that innovators in business don't always get a platform.","A well-conceived product excels at what it does. It's close to being functionally flawless - like a Ziploc bag, a radio from Tivoli Audio, a Philips Sonicare toothbrush, a Nespresso coffee maker or Google's home page.","I don't know whether the universe contains any evidence of intelligent design, but I can assure you that thousands of everyday products do not.","Businesses fail when they over-invest in what is at the expense of what could be.","It's not unusual for a would-be entrepreneur to get turned down half a dozen times before finding a willing investor - yet in most companies, it takes only one 'nyet' to kill a project stone dead.","I'm not one of those professors whose office is encased floor-to-ceiling with books. By the way, I think academics do this to intimidate their visitors.","If organized religion has become less relevant, it's not because churches have held fast to their creedal beliefs - it's because they've held fast to their conventional structures, programs, roles and routines.","What's true for churches is true for other institutions: the older and more organized they get, the less adaptable they become. That's why the most resilient things in our world - biological life, stock markets, the Internet - are loosely organized.","Large organizations don't worship shareholders or customers, they worship the past. If it were otherwise, it wouldn't take a crisis to set a company on a new path.","Obviously, you don't have to be religious to be moral, and beastly people are sometimes religious.","At the heart of every faith system is a bargain: on one side there is the comfort that comes from a narrative that suggests human life has cosmic significance, and on the other a duty to yield to moral commands that can, in the moment, seem rather inconvenient.","The fact is, society is made more hospitable by every individual who acts as if 'do unto others' really was a rule.","Over the centuries, religion has become institutionalized, and in the process encrusted with elaborate hierarchies, top-heavy bureaucracies, highly specialized roles and reflexive routines.","In a democracy, you don't need anyone's permission to form a new political party, publish a politically charged article, or organize a 'tea party.' And in open markets, individuals are free to buy and invest as they see fit.","In most languages, 'control' is the first synonym for the word 'manage.' Control is about spotting and correcting deviations from pre-defined standards; thus to control, one must first constrain.","Over time, a successful company will acquire much in the way of resources and momentum, and these things often insulate it from reality once it has stopped being successful.","We owe our existence to innovation. Our species exists thanks to four billion years of genetic innovation.","As human beings, we are the genetic elite, the sentient, contemplating and innovating sum of countless genetic accidents and transcription errors.","Most of us do more than subsist. From the vantage point of our ancestors, we live lives of almost unimaginable ease. Here again, we have innovation to thank.","Online hierarchies are inherently dynamic. The moment someone stops adding value to the community, his influence starts to wane.","Top-down authority structures turn employees into bootlickers, breed pointless struggles for political advantage, and discourage dissent.","In most companies, the formal hierarchy is a matter of public record - it's easy to discover who's in charge of what. By contrast, natural leaders don't appear on any organization chart.","In an ideal world, an individual's institutional power would be correlated perfectly with his or her value-add. In practice, this is seldom the case."],"Gary Hart":["I think there is one higher office than president and I would call that patriot.","The attractive lady whom I had only recently been introduced to dropped into my lap... I chose not to dump her off.","This is one Hart that you will not leave in San Francisco.","You can get awful famous in this country in seven days.","Follow me around. I don't care. If anybody wants to put a tail on me, go ahead. They'd be very bored.","If you want the government off your back, get your hands out of its pockets."],"Gary Herbert":["While technology and assessment can help complement the important work of our teachers, I worry that we are spending too much of our time testing.","I believe in collaboration and cooperation.","Too often, campaigns are all flash and no substance.","One person's rights do not have to come at the expense of another's. If we can find common ground on religious freedom and LGBT issues in Utah - one of the nation's most religious and conservative states - we can do it anywhere in the country.","Don't spend more than you take in. Control your debt. Empower the private sector. We have 50 states out there that are laboratories of democracy. Why are we not empowering the states to find solutions to our problems, particularly health care, as opposed to looking to a one-size-fits-all solution from Washington, D.C.? That puzzles even me.","From Enve Composites to Bluehouse Skis, Utah companies are making breakthrough products for biking, winter sports, water sports and more.","Once the federal dust settles, whether there is little to spend or a lot, education must continue to be our top priority. We can afford nothing less.","Utah's economy stays strong by adhering to conservative fundamental principles: low and consistent tax rates, smaller and more efficient government, sensible regulation, and empowering the private sector to create jobs.","Utah has benefited from setting smart tax policy. That said, public finding is dynamic enough that we cannot just set the tax policy and presume that it does not require continual review and adjustment.","Strong families are vital to strong societies.","The value of a loving family cannot be understated.","In 2014, Utah cities Salt Lake City and Provo both surpassed Silicon Valley in per-deal venture capital averages. From large, multi-campus companies to promising start-ups, Silicon Slopes offers a promising climate for businesses. The entire tech industry has its eyes on Utah.","In 2009, during my inaugural address, I expressed the importance of unprecedented partnerships. Since then, Utah's government, business, and education leaders in communities statewide have worked together more frequently and with better results than ever before.","When I entered into office mid-recession, my No. 1 focus was Utah's economy. We set bold goals, and we've built one of the best-performing economies in the nation.","That's a large part of the job as governor: to create and maintain the optimal balance.","My priority will continue to be that we maintain the optimal balance to be able to invest in education and infrastructure while encouraging business growth.","I don't believe we have defined health care reform very well in this country.","The Bush tax cuts, they ought to be made permanent in my mind so there is certainty out there.","There's no reason why fiscal responsibility is a Democrat or a Republican point of view. It ought to be all of our points of view.","Making people's lives better is not a partisan issue.","When it comes down to hardball, we have a veto pen, and I've used it in the past, and I expect we will have opportunity to use it in the future. That's the nature of the business.","Utah is America's best place for business because Utahns make it their business to succeed - and we have the track record to prove it.","In Utah, one word sums up our business prowess: investment. Simply put, we know we can't have long-term economic growth and maintain Utah's enviable quality of life without making some critical investments.","It's not enough for just us to invest in Utah; more and more, we are encouraging businesses around the world to follow suit. We want them to invest in and become part of Utah's future and to allow Utah to invest and become part of theirs.","Utah is one of the nation's leaders in rebounding from the Great Recession.","As governor, I enjoy the opportunity to talk about Utah's measurable business success.","My message to business leaders is clear: If you are looking to expand your business and boost the bottom line, there is no better place than Utah to do it.","I do believe that the states have the right to make the definition of marriage, and each state can define it as they so choose through their elected representatives.","Utah is no longer considered a flyover state.","Utahns deserve well thought out policy and plans.","I am confident that, as elected officials, we can work together with religious, business and civic leaders, as well as the LGBT community, to develop policies that treat all people with dignity and respect.","As we continue to step up our investment in education, we must not sidestep our commitment to the principle of local control.","Our World War II generation met the challenges of their time.","Education is the largest and most important investment Utah makes.","Sometimes, promoting economic development means accepting the Herculean task of moving and modernizing a prison.","Hope is the poor man's bread.","I wish I was a wealthy person. I wish I could self-fund.","I believe that our teachers need more freedom to be creative in the classroom in order to maximize the time students spend learning, not the time they spend taking tests.","Congress seems to be very good at doing nothing.","Partisanship is not necessarily a bad thing. It leads to new leadership and new opportunities.","Rob Neill has a deep appreciation for the law and the role it can play in the lives of families. Rob's sincere desire to serve and his impressive experience will make him the kind of judge who will change lives and impact families in a positive way."],"Gary Hume":["Small paintings can be fantastic. But you can't often get a narrative out of a small painting. In any case, museums are huge places, and you want to take up some space.","I want to paint something that's gorgeous, something that's perfect. So that it's full of sadness.","The disenfranchised should be going to art school - not the franchised.","The surface is all you get of me.","A painting should be tough; it should have muscle, but I have to find some tenderness in it, too. There has to be that dynamic.","I don't make political work. I don't make work that criticises the state. I make as human work as I can.","All art becomes history as soon as it is made, so it is inevitably part of a tradition. It doesn't matter a toss if it is in paint or in film; it is all art.","One drawing demands to become a painting, so I start to work on that, and then the painting might demand something else. Then the painting might say, 'I want a companion, and the companion should be like this,' so I have to find that, either by drawing it myself or locating the image.","People constantly describe me as a formalist or even a minimalist, but I'm not really bothered with the rules of painting or the history of painting. My approach is that everything is mine. I take what I can use from wherever, and then I forget where I've taken it from. But there is no point me making anything that looks like anyone else's.","My desire to be an artist really came out of being broke and unemployed and incapable of holding a job down. That's what it was driven by for sure.","I do think you get lonelier and lonelier being an artist as you get older.","I'm probably creative for half an hour a day. The rest of the time, I'm just doing what's necessary to make that creativity visible.","I don't vote. I voted Labour once, in that moment of euphoria. I know that if people only made a voice for change, then change will happen, but I'm not that person. I'm painting pictures.","I lived on nothing for years - squatted where I lived and where I worked, stole electricity, made things from stuff I found in skips, used paper that had been discarded - you do everything you can do to keep going and not have to get a job.","It's not part of my ambition to become fabulously rich. My plan was always to make my pictures, and hopefully people would buy them, and then I'd buy a studio, buy a house, help friends out, do bits and bobs - but I've no idea after that.","I love to see a wood full of bluebells. Growing up in the Kent countryside, I have special memories of this brief annual spectacle.","I found that gloss paint suited me entirely, and its qualities still intrigue me. It's viscous and fluid and feels like a pool. It's highly reflective, which means there are layers of looking. You look at the picture, and you look at the surface, then you look at the reflection in the surface behind you, then you look at yourself.","I'd like to give people leaden boots in galleries, so they'd be a bit slower in front of my paintings. And that's because I spend so much time looking at them. I can look at them a long, long time without getting bored. I disappear.","My mum always liked poetry, and she had pictures on the wall, so there was this visual stuff around.","Now, I love painting. I love looking. I love the fact that they don't move. They constantly change with the light. They are sort of patient.","I think Picasso is more feminine than Matisse.","I'm probably not going to develop to a final state as an artist. Like, become better and better, more and more refined. Become 'pure.' I don't think that's going to happen to me, because I don't really see that as something I want to explore.","I have to take it as a given that I have got a certain ability to do something. I can be an artist, which is take something and transform it into another thing. I can just see something, and I can see my painting.","I like things that are just about to go. Everything's leaving. Death is never far away from me. When you make something, death can't help but be in it.","If I'm feeling desperate, I'll go out image-hunting. I'll go to news agents and stand at the rack flicking through magazines or go to second-hand bookshops. And then, bit by bit, like concrete poetry, I start to realise that I am drawn to particular things, and then I start wondering why that is.","I got a job as an assistant film editor, which lasted for a few years, but I found writing incredibly difficult, and I thought, 'How am I going to make a film if I can't write?' I didn't really comprehend that someone else would do that bit.","I'm more and more fascinated in my own work. I work from 10 A.M. until about 9 P.M., but it's not an obsession, it's a pleasure. There's never enough time.","Over the years, my 'Door' paintings have become somewhat mythologized.","Sometimes I can see the whole painting from the outset in my mind's eye. But more often than not, that idea doesn't last the duration of the painting. Sometimes it comes out easy, just as I had envisaged. But that is reasonably rare.","I have to go with what the painting says to me. The painting is always informing me. I'm its servant; it's not mine. I'm doing what it wants."],"Gary Jennings":["I could list hundreds of words I've come up against in the course of my work that did not exist in the era of which I was writing and for which I never could find a suitably old-time, archaic or obsolete substitute.","To get into Afghanistan, I bribed my way into a camel caravan of smugglers.","I learned to interpret the ancient pictograph codices and read Nahuatl, the Aztec language.","When I got back to Madison Avenue, I realized that copywriters made more than artists, so I switched.","I starved and slept on park benches. I wrapped myself in the pages of my manuscript to keep warm. For two and a half years I took odd jobs; nothing was going to deter me.","I write novels, mostly historical ones, and I try hard to keep them accurate as to historical facts, milieu and flavor.","I contend, most seriously, that there is a real need for a good, thick, complete-as-possible dictionary of 'What People Used to Call Things.'","When I was living in Mexico and writing a book called 'Aztec,' I had to make a deliberate effort to ignore a lot of the 'typically Mexican landscape' around me - banana and citrus groves, roses and carnations, burros and toros - because they did not exist in Mexico in the 15th century, the time of my book.","When I was in Thailand, I went into the up-country because Marco Polo didn't get down into the flesh pots of Bangkok because they didn't exist in those days.","Everybody has done something about Marco Polo. It's the tiredest, most trite and worked-over subject in the world, and that was why it appealed to me, because I wanted to do something really new and different about something that had been worked over all these centuries, and I think I did.","In the 20th century alone, there have been 1,600 books about the circus. My adding one more would be superfluous unless I do something totally new and different."],"Gary Johnson":["We have the highest incarceration rate of any country in the world. 'America, land of liberty and freedom?' You know, that's baloney. More than 2 million Americans are behind bars now. Communist China has four times the population and they have 1.5 million people behind bars.","Regardless of who wins, an election should be a time for optimism and fresh approaches.","I leave abortion to the woman. I just fundamentally end there. I absolutely support a woman's right to choose.","I was opposed to the government mandating that restaurants not allow people to smoke, believing it becomes the customer's choice whether they go in or not. But then, I thought, 'What about the employees? Aren't they hostage to a smoking environment, even if they don't smoke?'","Most Americans are fiscally conservative and socially liberal. I'm advocating a balanced budget. But along with that, look, there should be gay marriage equality. A woman should have the right to choose. Let's not build a fence across the border.","That's the first sign you know you're a Libertarian. You see the red light. You stop. You realize that there's not a car in sight. And you put your foot on the gas.","Do I favor the death penalty? Theoretically, I do, but when you realize that there's a 4 percent error rate, you end up putting guilty people to death.","Immigration is a good thing. We should make that as easy as possible.","I don't want to put one innocent person to death to put 99 that are guilty to death. So philosophically I'm a tooth-for-tooth guy, but the reality is the death penalty as public policy is flawed.","It kind of scares me, the notion that we're going to be injecting ourselves into other countries' affairs when they're not posing a threat to our security. I wouldn't be telling Israel what to do.","I don't smoke marijuana anymore. I don't drink. Marijuana is a handicap. So is alcohol. Alcohol is a terrible handicap. But in spite of being a handicap, it shouldn't be criminal.","At the earliest age, when I saw a 'wet paint' sign, I had to touch the paint to see if it was wet. When I get stopped at the stoplight in the middle of the night, and there's just no cars coming, and the light is red, I go. I don't think I'm putting anyone in harm's way, and I'll just take the consequences. Because I'm a Libertarian.","We live in America. We live in a free society where we are able to make choices. It's about giving individuals freedoms and holding them accountable.","If there were no government-guaranteed student loans, college tuition would be much lower.","My vision of the border with Mexico is that a truck from the United States going into Mexico and a truck coming from Mexico into the United States will pass each other at the border going 60 miles an hour. Yes, we should have open borders.","Imagine a libertarian president ending impediments to free markets.","My issue with campaign finance is 100 percent disclosure. Wear a suit with patches from your big contributors. Depending on the size of the contribution, that's how big the patch should be.","We should be open to a discussion on keeping guns out of the hands of the mentally ill. I don't know how that manifests itself, but I'm looking to get elected president of the United States. I just want to let people know I have an open mind about how we might - how government might - interject itself in a lot of the problems we have.","I climbed Mount Everest. I don't quit.","I don't think you can climb Mount Everest with a broken leg, but I did break my leg prior to going to Mount Everest, so I was really climbing with a healing broken leg. I had the good fortune of climbing the highest mountain on each of the seven continents. That was a goal that I had.","The current prohibition laws are forcing drug disputes to be played out with guns in our streets. We need to put a stop to this criminal drug element in our country.","Having been governor of New Mexico, I know that legislation gets passed to benefit those who have money and influence. Then they buy more money and influence. That's one reason why, as governor, I vetoed more than 750 bills and thousands of line items. I did it to keep crony capitalism away from government.","This country would be a better place to live in if all the resources we currently put toward criminalizing marijuana were instead spent by law enforcement on protection from real crime, as opposed to victimless crime.","Tonight was a great opportunity to take on the political status quo that has given us trillion dollar deficits and put millions out of work. Our objective was to inject some common sense into the conversation among Republicans at a time when business-as-usual simply won't work.","It is clear from the reaction to our campaign so far that our message is resonating. I look forward to continuing to take this message to all Americans, and showing them that I can be as successful running the country as I was running the state of New Mexico.","We're on the verge of a financial collapse unless we balance the budget, and that means some really, really tough decisions.","As I told the students every time I visited a campus, you are the director of your own movie, and if you aren't enjoying what you are doing, change it.","Where in the Constitution does it say that because we don't like a foreign country's leader, we should go in and topple the dictator?","Every time you pass a law, it is a little bite out of freedom.","Politics is a herd mentality. Politicians don't really lead. Politicians reflect what they think is consensus opinion.","All I suggest is to make K-12 like higher education. Higher education in the United States is the best in the world because these institutions compete with each other for your tuition dollar. Let's just bring competition to public education.","I'm outraged that we're building roads, schools, and hospitals in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that we're doing it with borrowed money from China that we're paying interest on. I'm outraged.","I reject the insurance model. I think we should have a free-market approach to healthcare.","If China wants to spend $10 producing a product and sell it for a buck, who benefits from that? I think we do. I'm the free market guy. I think free markets work.","We need to understand the difference between freedom of religion - which is absolutely guaranteed and I would fervently defend. Sharia law is politics; it's not religion. If you say that a woman is voluntarily going to be of lesser value than a man, which is in sharia law, can we allow that?","I'm not a stone-thrower when it comes to Hillary Clinton and her emails and her server. I don't think there has been criminal intent on Hillary Clinton's part. I don't see an indictment.","America is big enough to accommodate differences of opinion and practice on religious and social beliefs. As a nation and as a society, we must reject discrimination, forcefully and without asterisks. Most importantly, as president, I will zealously defend the Constitution of the United States and all of its amendments.","It costs more money to put a person on death row than it does to lock them up for the rest of their lives because of attorney fees.","As governor of New Mexico, I would have - I signed a bill banning late term abortion. I've always favored parental notification. I've always favored counseling. I've always favored the notion of no public funds used for abortion.","One of the biggest concerns that many voters have with both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, but particularly with Ms. Clinton, is the sense that she uses government power to advance her personal and political interests. She is the very status quo. Americans want that changed.","Given the divisiveness and pain that have accompanied several state religious freedom laws, I approach attempts at legislating religious exceptions to anti-discrimination laws with great sensitivity and care.","I believe we can, and must, strike a balance between our shared American values of religious liberty and freedom from discrimination. My concerns lie with the possible consequences of politically-driven legislation which claims to promote religious liberty but instead rolls back the legal protections held by LGBT Americans.","The voice of the Republican party is up for grabs. It's a contest right now.","The excitement right now is coming from the Liberty movement. And the Republicans want a piece of it.","I'm finding myself really angry over spending and the deficit. I'm finding myself really angry over what's happening in the Middle East, the decision to stay in Afghanistan indefinitely. I'm angry about cap and trade. And I've been on record for a long time on the failed war on drugs.","I had a 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' experience as governor.","I'm absolutely a Ron Paul fan.","It's not 2038 that Social Security is bankrupt. It's now.","Regardless of my legislation, spending has to be stopped.","My next-door neighbor's two dogs have created more shovel-ready jobs than this current administration.","Balance the federal budget now, not 15 years from now, not 20 years from now, but now. And throw out the entire federal tax system, replace it with a fair tax, a consumption tax, that by all measurements is just that. It's fair.","I hope that people will see that we don't have to sit by the sidelines and watch as the two major parties limit their choices to slightly different flavors of the status quo. It is, in fact, possible to join the fray, stand up for principles and offer a real alternative.","I think libertarians need somebody who can articulate getting from A to Z. But you know, if G is achievable, how about it? Let's get there!","I never, ever, when I entered this process of running for president of the United States, thought I would be excluded from the debate table. Ever. What does two terms as governor get you?","I love Costco.","I am actually one of those who took President Obama at his word when he first ran - that he would get us out of ill-advised wars, that he would do something about health care costs, and that he would protect civil liberties. Like many Americans, I was disappointed.","We should make it as easy as possible to be able to get a legal work visa - not citizenship, not a green card. Just a work visa, with a background check and a Social Security card so that applicable taxes would get paid.","Everyone else is parsing it in terms of lowering the corporate income tax. Eliminate it. It's not that big of a generator of income, and it's a double tax. Get rid of it, and you would have an explosion of hiring.","I ran two campaigns for governor in a state that's 2-1 Democrat where I did not mention my opponent in print, radio, or television. I don't know if any other politician at a gubernatorial, congressional, or a senatorial level can make the claim.","People are clamoring to hear good ideas as opposed to the lesser of two evils... Either the Democrats are going to win or the Republicans are going to win, but the losers are all of us out here as citizens that really do want meaningful change, and none of it's happening. There's no dialogue regarding meaningful change.","Marriage equality - I think that it's a constitutionally guaranteed right. Let's end the drug wars. Let's balance the federal budget, and that means reforming the entitlements - Medicaid, Medicare.","Using a broad brushstroke, I think Libertarian - most of America are socially accepting and fiscally responsible. I'm in that category. I think, broadly speaking, that's a Libertarian. A Libertarian is going to be somebody who's really strong on civil liberties.","I'm going to make the claim that I'm stronger than Obama when it comes to civil liberties, and I'm going to make the claim that I'm stronger than Romney when it comes to dollars and cents.","If there's a clear genocide somewhere, don't we really want to positively impact that kind of a situation? Isn't that what we're all about? Isn't that what we've always been about?","I don't personally have a sense that life starts at conception. I don't personally have that sense.","I think the government should be out of the marriage business and leave marriage to the churches.","I think I view the system the same way that Ayn Rand views the system - that it really oppresses those that create, if you will, and tries to take away from those that produce and give to the non-producers.","I just feel abandoned. And I feel, I don't feel represented by the Republican Party. I have always had to defend the social side of the Republican Party by saying that it's not the majority, that it's not their focus, when everything suggests just the opposite.","I see the demographics increasing, and by that I mean the notion of social acceptance is growing, not decreasing; I think the notion of fiscal responsibility is growing, not decreasing. And Republicans seem to be moving further away from those two categories than closer.","This is something that I witnessed out on the campaign trail for three years, which is that there is a total disconnect between the rhetoric regarding immigration and the reality. And I'm speaking as a border state.","There was a big difference between Ron Paul and me when it came to the 'no.' His 'no' was philosophical. It was reasoned. It was right. My 'no' actually put a stop to legislation. It cut spending. Mine carried further than just no.","Let's abolish the IRS, let's eliminate income tax, let's eliminate corporate tax, let's balance the federal budget, and if we need a tax, it can be one federal consumption tax.","In a zero corporate tax rate environment, if the private sector doesn't create tens of millions of jobs, then I don't know what it takes to create tens of millions of jobs.","I would have never signed the Patriot Act. I would have never signed the National Defense Authorization Act allowing for arrests and detainment of you and me as U.S. citizens without being charged.","I'll be the first one to admit that if I have conclusions based on faulty premises, then let me know about that, and I'll be the first one to change it.","There's an unintended consequence when it comes to drone attacks in Yemen. Yeah, you take out the al-Qaida stronghold, but you also wipe out the other half of the block. That makes Yemenis against the United States for the rest of their lives and all their descendants.","I don't want to close the door that if any of us were president of the United States that we would sit idly by and watch something like the Holocaust go down. I don't want to close the door on the United States involving themselves and putting a stop to that. Can we spend money on that? Yeah, I think so.","Am I not correct in saying that Iran has never voiced that they are developing a nuclear weapon, nor do they have any intention of using a nuclear weapon against the United States? That's never actually been voiced. I don't know where that has come from, but it hasn't been from Iran.","I was your C student. I paid attention in the classes that were about how to get elected.","We do live in an environment of crony capitalism, and the main reason we do is that loopholes are for sale, and both parties have their hands out through those loopholes.","I've always considered myself a Libertarian. While I was running for governor of New Mexico, the Republicans were totally inclusive of me; the party was open-armed, but they never thought I'd win. I delivered in a really big way; I exceeded their expectations and think I'm still highly regarded by the GOP in New Mexico.","My supporters are people who believe in being fiscally responsible and socially accepting. I think most people are in that category. Speaking with a broad brushstroke, those are my supporters.","I would say that a wasted vote is voting for anybody you don't believe in. If you believe in the third party, that's the guy you need to voice for. That's how you change things.","I don't think you'll ever hear me invoking God in anything I do.","I have not watched Glenn Beck. I don't watch him.","Any movement at all that reduces disease, that reduces overdoses, that reduces property crime, that reduces violent crime, is good.","I think that the best that government can do for you and I as individuals is to empower you and I to make decisions that only you and I should make.","I support gay unions. I think the government should get out of the marriage business completely - leave marriages to the churches. And grant civil unions to gay couples, grant civil unions to a man and woman.","Part of being out there, campaigning, talking to people, is being able to read body language.","I just think everything we do has an unintended consequence. We take out Saddam Hussein in Iraq, and Iraq was the check against Iran.","Involvement in Afghanistan, I thought, was totally warranted. We were attacked, we attacked back, but after six months of being in Afghanistan, I thought we had pretty well effectively wiped out al Qaeda.","I think the world looks down on Republicans for their socially conservative views, which includes religion in government.","I'd like to think I would have signed the Civil Rights bill and wouldn't have had any issues with it.","The retirement age needs to be raised. A portion of Social Security ought to be privatized, if not all. And there probably needs to be some means testing. It's a Ponzi scheme that's not sustainable.","I was raised a Christian. I'd like to think I have Christian values. I don't attend church.","If I was a state, I would like to see education left to the schools themselves, but I don't want the federal government involved in education. I think that it ends up setting standards that cost you time and money and don't make any difference in education. I want to stop that.","Getting elected Governor of New Mexico, I really did enjoy that job. I thought I made a really big difference, and I think the same running for president of the United States - that I could make a really big, positive difference.","Every single figure on Mount Rushmore was a third party at one time or another, so third parties become major parties, and I think that the Libertarian Party may become my major party.","I'm one of those who believe the bumper sticker: If you outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns. The first people who are going to be in line to turn in their guns are law-abiding citizens. Criminals are going to be left with guns.","Politicians shouldn't spend most of their time in office trying to get reelected.","I'm ready for a different America.","Unlike President Obama, I am not afraid to state, without a wink or a nod, that the government has no right to tell us who we can marry or not marry.","I don't believe there should be any restrictions when it comes to firearms. None.","At the base of Ron Paul support, in my opinion, are people with brains.","Would the world be a better place if all drugs were legalized tomorrow? Absolutely. But pragmatically speaking, you're not going to go from the criminalization of all drugs to the legalization of drugs overnight.","I don't seek the counsel of God. God doesn't speak to me on what I should or shouldn't do.","New Mexico is 2-to-1 Democrat. I got elected as a Republican. I think I did a great job of showing people that government doesn't have to spend money to make you happy, that government really needs to be providing a level playing field.","Would this country be better off if no one drank? Yes, it would be, but we tried that; it doesn't work. I don't want to tell anybody that they can't have as many drinks as they want every single night of the week as long as they don't get behind the wheel of a car.","By bringing about a rational drug policy, we'd be freeing up a lot of resources for real crime. Drug disputes would get played out with courts rather than with guns. So it would make this country a much better place overnight.","I believe in a strong national defense. But it's my belief that neither Iraq nor Afghanistan poses a threat to national security, and we shouldn't be involved in either area.","My fear is that people associate Rand Paul's social conservatism with libertarianism, when it's not.","I agree that the two-party system stomps on any kind of competition. A great first step is to open the presidential debates to all qualified candidates, including the Libertarians. If that happens, the Libertarian party will experience unprecedented growth.","One of the things government should be around for is to deal with catastrophes. It should do that well. To me, that's a government function, and we shouldn't be playing political games with it.","I think we should balance the federal budget tomorrow. I'm optimistic. I think Americans are optimistic. We went to the moon; we can balance the federal budget.","If I could wave a magic wand, we would eliminate income tax; we would eliminate corporate tax. We would abolish the IRS, and we could replace all of it with one federal consumption tax.","If we had zero corporate tax in this country, tens of millions of jobs would get created in this country for no other reason.","I hear that Donald Trump is watching the Olympics tonight. He's seeing how high the Mexican pole vaulters go.","If Clinton is elected or if Trump is going to get elected, I think the polarization in Congress will be greater than ever. Nothing is going to get done. It is going to be so ugly, so partisan, so back-biting. Well what if you elect a couple of Libertarians?","I just see religious freedom, as a category, as just being a black hole.","I think there are plenty of Libertarians that are socially conservative.","It is long overdue that we have a woman as a legitimate contender for the White House. But Hillary Clinton is the definition of the establishment so many are determined to reject.","I have had the good fortune to be able to climb the highest mountain on each of the seven continents. I have enjoyed the freedom I had gained from building a successful business from scratch, making some money, and creating the lifestyle I wanted.","I had my freedom, and I had my comfortable life, but I couldn't accept the fact that the politicians were making it increasingly difficult for my kids and millions of others to achieve their dreams as I had achieved mine. So, in 2012, I ran for president.","Millennials - who will soon be a full one-third of American adults - may be especially ready to become engaged in politics with a candidate who wants to give them a government that will leave them alone and get its finances in order so that they don't inherit an economic collapse.","My opinion, having done this now for two cycles, is I think the national media really likes me and likes what I have to say. But, at the end of the day, 'He's a Libertarian,' and that denotes some loose screws, maybe.","In New Mexico... I may have vetoed more legislation as governor of New Mexico than all the other governors in the country combined.","On Hillary's side, I don't think it gets more establishment than Hillary Clinton. If I had one word to describe Hillary, it would be 'beholden.' Nothing's gonna really change. Government's gonna have the answer to everything, and that's gonna mean taxes are gonna go up.","I think Hillary is going to be more hawkish perhaps than Obama. Perhaps more hawkish than Trump. Trump, though, is really a windshield wiper. He says one thing that makes sense and then says something that doesn't make sense.","I'm one of the people that, when I hear Republicans talk about repealing Obamacare, I just want to roll my eyes. Republicans talk about reform to the healthcare, and they talk about selling insurance across state lines, and that's their solution?","I was the Republican governor of the heavily Democratic state of New Mexico. I focused on good government, and I got it done - just like my running mate, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld. The people of New Mexico reelected me by a comfortable margin. Ditto for Weld.","Our government should not be spying on the electronic communications of American citizens. Nor should our iPhones or Android devices be subject to unreasonable searches and seizures.","Hillary - at the end of the day, isn't that going to be about bigger government? Isn't that going to be about more taxes?","With regard to Trump, he's saying some things that I just think are ridiculous and would disqualify any other candidate.","There's no way that a third party wins without being in the presidential debates. I think the vast majority of Americans are Libertarian; they just don't know it.","I am totally a fringe candidate, and so is Bill Weld: you know, two Republican governors serving in heavily blue states, outspoken, small government guys, outspoken on the social liberal side. We're fringe, totally. We're fringe.","At the end of the day, Democrats go out and appeal to 30 percent of the far left; Republicans go out and appeal to 30 percent of the far right. Hey, there's a big middle ground here that's not represented. I think that, Bill Weld and myself, I think the Libertarian Party really occupies that ground.","We are a nation of immigrants, and if the truth be known, don't we need a whole lot of immigrants to be buying homes and to drive our economy and to take jobs that U.S. citizens don't want?","I majored in political science and English, but starting from the age of 17, I've paid for everything that I've had in my life. It was a personal choice. My parents would have helped me in any way whatsoever, but for me, you know what? I can make my own way.","I would abolish the federal Department of Education and very quickly. People don't realize that the federal Department of Education gives each state 11 cents out of every school dollar that every state spends. But it comes with 15 cents worth of strings attached.","Religious beliefs have played a vital role in forming America's character as well as my own. I was raised as a Lutheran, and I believe in God and consider my faith and involvement with organized religion to be an important part of who I am.","New Mexico is the second Hollywood. No, it is, it is. They built all sorts of film studios.","I'm a plodder, one foot in front of the other. Life is all about understanding that anything that can go wrong, will go wrong. And it's your ability with how you deal with that adversity that ultimately affects your success.","Imagine a libertarian president challenging Congress to repeal the PATRIOT Act.","Imagine a libertarian president challenging Congress for meaningful immigration reform.","I think a great starting point for a debate and discussion over a national consumption tax is, let's start with the Fair Tax, legislation that has been written up and, I think, signed up on by 80 congressmen and women.","Medicaid and Medicare both need to be devolved to the states."],"Gary Kemp":["My brother Martin is two years younger than me. There has never been any competition between us - clearly he was the good-looking one; he was also very sporty, and I am not a football player.","I'm an atheist. I don't 'believe' at all.","I am a metrosexual and into male grooming - I moisturise, I exfoliate.","Maybe I've got to admit that what I did here was enough. I can make some more films. Maybe I'll direct a film. Maybe I'll have my musical put on stage. But nothing, really, to be absolutely honest, competes with making a very successful pop band for 10 years of my life.","For 24 hours a day, for 10 years, all I thought about was being in a band. That's all I did. I had no other social life. I don't want my life to be like that now. I've spent the past 10 years having a real life as well. But Spandau Ballet is such a difficult shadow to outrun.","We were on the cover of Women's Wear Daily, which was hardly rock 'n' roll, but it pleased me.","Your life is the same wherever you go.","Pop music should be about young people.","It's a shame because we experienced probably the greatest thing - in art, in pop - we'll ever do. And it would be good to sit around and talk about it.","I've always thought that actors wanted to be pop musicians and pop musicians wanted to be actors.","I've been through Hell with some of the members of my old band, and Hell is highly stressful.","I detest that saying 'Everything happens for a reason'; it's nonsense.","I think my younger self would be more amazed to know I was doing an interview for 'The Spectator.'","My father had inklings of my cultural aspirations. He would take me to the library, things like that. But he wasn't one of those dads who had read George Orwell and was a member of the Communist party. We had no books at home.","I certainly wasn't a fan of Thatcher's politics. People liked to label us as children of Thatcher. What nonsense. The real children of Thatcher came in the 1990s, and had no interest in politics. The Oasis, Britpop scene.","It's always an honour doing anything for your country.","I think I tried to control situations within my first marriage and I wasn't the easiest person to live with.","My instinct is to be very controlling.","I think sometimes my controlling instincts came out of a fear of other people.","In the '80s the band was 24/7. You were only as good as what you were producing at any given moment. Now my family is more important. I also think having the shock of your mum and dad dying humbles you slightly.","I love England. I don't really like places when they're too hot. It's my Celtic blood.","I have a terrible fear of travel. Just before we go, I start to panic and tell my wife I don't want to go. It's ridiculous. But actually it's only when it's somewhere I've not been to before.","I keep my house tidy, because then I can think clearly. I feel the same about myself. Presenting yourself well is a working-class thing - my dad was a printer, but he wore a tie most days. The ungroomed look belongs more to the middle classes.","I am a person who holds the aesthetic high. I have suits made in Savile Row.","Don't see the point in reading ghost-written autobiographies, even though some of these published lives may fascinate me. The 'ghost' is always present, manipulating an interview into first-person singular text, and it feels like I'm reading a lie.","We never had books at home, but my dad, seeing how keen I was to read, took me to Islington Library when I was about eight and we pulled out two - a Biggles and a science fiction novel. I never got the ace fighter pilot but fell in love with all things to do with the future and space. Isaac Asimov soon became my guiding star.","Punk was sort of an angry stance against things that had happened just before, against the pop of glam rock, against progressive rock. Music had become very staid and it was about the playing and people obsessed. Eric Clapton was God and we needed an enema within the art form, and punk did do that.","Kevin Costner told me that 'True' was his and his wife's song. I'm not sure if that's a good thing because they split up soon after.","Songwriting helps me sort out my personal problems. With acting, you're just a tool for someone's ideas.","The thought of going on tour with people like Toyah Wilcox is just appalling. I'm certainly not tempted."],"Gary Kovacs":["Privacy is not an option, and it shouldn't be the price we accept for just getting on the Internet.","Flash content is the most prolific content on the web today; it is the way people express themselves on the Internet.","The long-term value proposition for cellphone companies isn't just voice conversation - it's transfer of data.","The stream in my hometown Calgary is the oil and gas industry - that's the talk you hear on the street.","You have to have in mind what you want when you go public. It's not just an end in and of itself. Suddenly, you have investors to satisfy. Investors who want - who demand - a return.","I don't know why, but I'm continually amazed to think that two and a half billion of us around the world are connected to each other through the Internet and that at any point in time more than 30 percent of the world's population can go online to learn, to create and to share.","When I know the data that's being shared and I'm asked explicitly for my consent, I want some sites to understand my habits. It helps them suggest books for me to read or movies for my family to watch or friends for us to connect with."],"Gary Krist":["Many critics, when trying to praise a short-story collection, will say that it has the heft and scope of a good novel. But for me, one of the highest compliments you can pay a novel is to say that it has the rich texture and eloquent detail of a good story collection.","Let's start at the very end: The postscript of Stephen King's 'On Writing' contains some of the most harrowing pages he has ever written. It's here that King describes the traffic accident that nearly killed him in June 1999.","Lionel Essrog, the twitching, barking, gabbling narrator of Jonathan Lethem's new novel, 'Motherless Brooklyn,' is no movie-of-the-week novelty grafted onto a noir mystery. Maybe his Tourette's is a gimmick, but it's a gimmick with depth, with soul.","The Illinois Constitution was written before they realized they'd have a city the size of Chicago in the state. The constitution had severe limits on the ability of any city to raise monies through taxes and bonds. When Chicago grew explosively, they had to come up with ways of getting more money to do more things.","Future historians trying to determine what it was like to be alive in fin de millennium America should read the last two decades of O. Henry and Best American short-story collections.","Something often neglected in popular accounts of the Wild West is the extent to which its dramas were colored by the politics and personal resentments left by the Civil War.","When it comes to jump-starting the intricate machinery of recollection, there's nothing more effective than the scent of approaching death."],"Gary L. Francione":["Just as we reject racism, sexism, ageism, and heterosexism, we reject speciesism. The species of a sentient being is no more reason to deny the protection of this basic right than race, sex, age, or sexual orientation is a reason to deny membership in the human moral community to other humans.","We eat animals because they taste good. And if that's O.K., what's wrong with wearing fur? We need as a society to think seriously about our institutionalized animal use.","Michael Vick may enjoy watching dogs fight. Someone else may find that repulsive but see nothing wrong with eating an animal who has had a life as full of pain and suffering as the lives of the fighting dogs. It's strange that we regard the latter as morally different from, and superior to, the former.","Most of the time, those who use animals in experiments justify that use by pointing to alleged benefits to human and animal health and the supposed necessity of using animals to obtain those benefits.","Because animals are property, we consider as 'humane treatment' that we would regard as torture if it were inflicted on humans.","We do not need to eat animals, wear animals, or use animals for entertainment purposes, and our only defense of these uses is our pleasure, amusement, and convenience.","The proposition that humans have mental characteristics wholly absent in non-humans is inconsistent with the theory of evolution.","There is no moral distinction between fur and other materials made from animals, such as leather, which also is the result of the suffering and death of sentient beings.","We do not think clearly about our moral obligations to animals.","There is no 'need' for us to eat meat, dairy or eggs. Indeed, these foods are increasingly linked to various human diseases and animal agriculture is an environmental disaster for the planet.","There is increasing social concern about our use of nonhumans for experiments, food, clothing and entertainment. This concern about animals reflects both our own moral development as a civilization and our recognition that the differences between humans and animals are, for the most part, differences of degree and not of kind."],"Gary Larson":["Great moments in science: Einstein discovers that time is actually money.","A long time ago, I became aware that many of us have a tendency to lump nature into simplistic categories, such as what we consider beautiful or ugly, important or unimportant. As human a thing as that is to do, I think it often leads us to misunderstand the respective roles of life forms and their interconnectedness.","The Bluebird of Happiness long absent from his life, Ned is visited by the Chicken of Depression.","You should always leave the party 10 minutes before you actually do.","I've always considered music stores to be the graveyards of musicians.","You know those little snow globes that you shake up? I always thought my brain was sort of like that. You know, where you just give it a shake and watch what comes out and shake it again. It's like that.","The message is not so much that the worms will inherit the Earth, but that all things play a role in nature, even the lowly worm.","On Career Day in high school, you don't walk around looking for the cartoon guy.","I think I'm maintaining the quality, but internally I'm paying for it.","Humans have changed ecosystems more rapidly and extensively than in any comparable period of time in human history, largely to meet rapidly growing demands for food, fresh water, timber, fiber and fuel. This has resulted in a substantial and largely irreversible loss in the diversity of life on Earth.","The daily calendar seemed, to me, like a kind of cartoon black hole, and you didn't have to be a rocket scientist to know that that couldn't be sustained indefinitely. That's why I pulled the plug on that one after the '02 edition. Kind of a preemptive strike.","Every week when my batch of weekly cartoons would go to FedEx, it felt like a small miracle. Then in a few days, it's 'Here we go again.'","I just get silly inside my head and I start to think about something and in my head I start twisting it around, contorting it and envisioning it in different ways.","This was more than just a cow - this was an entire career I was looking at.","I actually find a lot of parallels in jazz and cartooning.","People try to look for deep meanings in my work. I want to say, 'They're just cartoons, folks. You laugh or you don't.' Gee, I sound shallow. But I don't react to current events or other stimuli. I don't read or watch TV to get ideas. My work is basically sitting down at the drawing table and getting silly.","I keep thinking someone's gonna show up and say, 'There's been a big mistake. The guy next door is supposed to be drawing the cartoon. Here's your shovel.'","I think one thing that's important to maintain is a sense of fear, always doubting yourself... a good dose of insecurity helps your work in some ways.","My future plans are hazy, and I've yet to experience how much cartooning is in my blood and therefore how much I'll miss it. But I have some other interests, especially in music, and I will probably take the opportunity to delve into those things more deeply.","Cartooning was a good fit for me. And yet now, years later, I almost never think about it."],"Gary Lineker":["Football is a simple game. Twenty-two men chase a ball for 90 minutes and at the end, the Germans always win.","What you learn is that you can't please everyone all the time.","Not many players would turn down a chance to play for Real Madrid and Barcelona, as they're right at the top the tree in terms of football.","Ferrari or Lamborghini. Never fancied one of those - too flash for me. I don't really like seeking too much attention.","It's true: a lot of sportspeople really struggle to find something to do when they finish. It tips them into all sorts of strange things. With ex-footballers, it's really scary. I think 70% of them get divorced within five years. It's hard. You go from being really famous to not that famous. Your salary drops through the floor.","I've only got a Saturday job so my weekdays are generally pretty free.","Playing football and presenting TV are totally different things, but there are similarities: it's exciting, it can go well, it can go badly... the difference is when presenting goes badly, it doesn't really affect anyone's life, whereas when you have a bad day on the pitch, it affects people's moods for a whole week.","It would be a great adventure for Leicester to be in the Champions League.","It would be more weird if people didn't stare at me or shout at me.","People are fed up with the way things are. There is a lot of bitterness out there, a lot of anger about a lack of jobs and concerns for the next generation.","The treatment by some towards these young refugees is hideously racist and utterly heartless. What's happening to our country?","I'm not that moody. I don't have big ups and downs.","Some players are quite homely, and they don't see themselves going abroad; others would relish the challenge. I can only speak personally, but I always wanted the challenge, and to go and live in a place like Barcelona was great.","On TV, if you fluff your lines, nobody gives a toss. But if you fluff a penalty in the World Cup, well - we all know how much that matters.","You cannot get involved in debate on 'MOTD'. You can do it on Sky because they've got hours and hours. We've got a couple of minutes. It's a very disciplined show. Our primary purpose is to show the action, and the analysis is very secondary. We have lots of people who would prefer no analysis. We have lots of people who would prefer more analysis.","This is ludicrous. Seven- and eight-year-olds valiantly trying to cover the same acreage as those grown-up chaps in the Premier League is absurd. To add to the lunacy, a little goalkeeper, barely out of nappies, has to stand between posts that are eight strides apart - adult strides - and under a crossbar more than twice his height.","We have got too many kids around the house to have a romantic meal at home. But Danielle is a fantastic cook. She does a brilliant lasagne, great roasts and a great chilli dish. She knows the way to my heart.","I just think to be a manager you've got to live and breathe and have this incredible enthusiasm for football, the whole thing. And while I love the game, and it's been a large part of my life, it's not the only thing in my life.","The World Cup is every four years, so it's going to be a perennial problem.","In terms of aesthetics, I probably look better than I did when I played.","In all sports, people get competitive; things happen that shouldn't happen.","The truth is I don't feel too bad for my age. I actually have a better shape now than I used to.","I was only interested in scoring goals. I wasn't interested in anything else.","If somebody in the crowd spits at you, you've got to swallow it.","When I see old photos of me on the beach I don't look too bad... but it's hard trying to breathe in for such a long time when I spot the photographers!","Ooh, it's too embarrassing to share my innermost romantic secrets - although I have written Danielle the odd poem. If anything they are more comedic than romantic. They used to be well-received but that was before she started studying Shakespeare at drama college. Now I feel so inept.","We are in the entertainment business and we all know if you are top of the tree you get the big money. Those of us who have been in it are the fortunate ones but we understand that we probably don't deserve it as much as the nurses or teachers.","I know I could never be in a pop band. I honestly have an appalling voice.","I know I am extraordinarily lucky to be doing what I am doing. I have worked hard along the way and I have been blessed too. I have had a great life.","My eldest son George had acute myeloid leukaemia when he was a tiny baby, he is now 20 and doing very well. He is a mini-miracle in many ways.","The whole kiss-and-tell thing is a negative approach that often happens in a World Cup. We will see negative stories about the players and it can affect their confidence and the overall performance of the national team on the pitch, let alone the bid to actually stage the competition.","The train's always full of football fans going up to see matches. Oh, they make sure I hear their points of view all right. They all want to have their say about their team, and make their opinions known.","I'm disappearing from twitter for a while. Need a break from the bile. Local prejudice just seems to bring out the worst in some people.","I am not leaving twitter. If the mindless few defeat the thoughtful majority we are all doomed.","When you're winning games, everyone thinks everything the manager says and does is fantastic. Then it goes the other way, and those earlier criticisms of players can backfire.","The best, most successful managers in the modern era are those who can keep a player happy even if he is not in the team. Given the size of the squads and the use of rotation nowadays, that's tougher than it's ever been.","That's one of the magical things about the Olympics, Team GB will have someone challenging in a sport that we've never watched and all of a sudden it'll be the biggest thing ever.","My wife Danielle and I love travelling, different cultures and good weather.","I try to avoid saying 'fantastic' too often and 'obviously' is a dangerous word for all broadcasters.","My fiancee's brother-in-law was recently paralysed in an accident and it really brought home the fact that thousands of young people live with spinal injuries. It's an issue I wish had more coverage.","I was quite good at football once, although other than that my speciality would be maths. I'm great at sudokus and find all the spin-off games pretty easy too.","You've got no chance of reaching the top if you're just playing for money.","I wouldn't want to go out six nights a week and watch somebody's reserves playing to check out a footballer to see if we're going to buy him.","I don't feel that I'm particularly political. I'm interested in politics; I'll express my view if I feel strongly about something, but humanitarian issues, I think, are slightly different.","I can't understand why someone wouldn't have a degree of sympathy for people that had to flee their country, travel to try and find their home somewhere, and nobody wants them. How could you not be a little bit sympathetic?","It's only a matter of time before the English clubs become a lot more competitive in Europe, if not dominant, because our league is, by far, the richest league in the world.","In terms of politics, I just look at people's policies, and sometimes I agree with something, sometimes I won't.","The Leicester story is great for the game in England. It's great for the appreciation of the Premier League.","I've had hundreds of requests from journalists all over the world asking me to speak about Leicester, which is astonishing. It's captured the imagination.","People are possibly not spelling 'Leicester' correctly everywhere round the globe, but they are at least saying it correctly now.","People make mistakes. They say stupid things.","I've heard things said on football pitches that players clearly don't mean, whether it's racism or just an abusive comment in the heat of the moment.","Fundamentally, footballers don't look around a dressing room and think, 'He's a black player... he's Japanese.' They don't think like that. They think, 'He's a good player; he can help. He's not very good.' I'm not trying to defend anyone's actions, but there are going to be isolated incidents because it's an emotive, passionate sport.","I think if I'd ever had any skeletons in the closet, they'd have been out a long time ago.","I'm more of a 5 Live man. But I might listen to a bit of Coldplay or The Smiths.","I try very hard to be bad, but people never take me seriously.","Being called Gary. It's a crap name. I wish I'd been called by my middle name, Winston.","Our games are not always the best, but they are exciting, which is what people love to see.","Twitter has been a godsend for travelling.","The way children are taught football doesn't encourage skill; the focus is on other areas.","People have no idea how hard football is, absolutely no idea. It's all about pace. You can say, 'Yeah, you've got speed of thought' - but you've got to have a little bit of a zip.","I think I'm expected to behave in a certain manner.","I think people come and go, 'I'm going to find the real Gary. What is it... the real Gary? I've got to find it.' But the thing is, it's pretty much what you see is what you get. I'm just like this. There's no hidden viciousness.","In my day, I wasn't the best footballer, but I was the best goalscorer for two or three years.","Football matters so much to people, and they get very defensive - or angry.","We almost need a revolution in the culture of our thinking about football.","If you are at the top in entertainment, you earn money that you can never justify to ordinary people doing proper jobs. You can't.","It's really hard for kids nowadays: you can get a decent education, but there are no jobs out there. You worry about how they are ever going to afford to live anywhere.","Twitter is an amazing thing; it brings footballers closer to the fans because so many of them are on there. I was cynical about it to begin with, but I have been converted.","Are people like Tom Cruise in touch with their public? I doubt it. Footballers are more like the rock stars of yester-year: they are box office.","Diving is a really, really difficult one because a player is the only one who genuinely knows whether they have dived. You can look at it at 40 different angles and not know. And you can just fall over, too.","I remember Nayim at Tottenham dived all over the place, and we used to say to him, 'What are you doing?' You do talk about it.","In any other corporation, if there was so many things that were found to be corrupt, then the man at the top would go - but that doesn't seem to be the case with FIFA.","Must say though, I'm rather chuffed to have been called a 'luvvie'.","Feel ashamed of my generation. We've let down our children and their children.","I've quite often written tweets that I think are across that line, but I just delete them.","In this country, since footballs made from pigs' bladders were whacked into goals without nets, we've played on full-size pitches. Whatever our age.","The only way to get to the other end of the pitch is to belt it and then belt it again.","The competitive nature of most mums and dads is astounding. The fear they instil in our promising but sensitive Johnny is utterly depressing. We need a parental cultural revolution.","In the time I spent with him, Jurgen Klopp was enigmatic, larger than life, and extremely quick-witted. He is quite unique as a football manager in many ways, and that is what makes him so entertaining.","I'm in good shape.","Basically, Walkers are putting real produce into their flavours, so the cheese and onion flavour is actually cheese and onion rather than just flavourings.","I hear it all the time in the street: 'It's the crisp bloke.'","I think the important thing we have to remember about football in this country is that it is very vibrant, and it's very good to watch, not only in the flesh but also on TV, because our stadiums are full.","We do not want to alienate supporters.","In terms of the pricing of football tickets, there's no need - given the massive amount of money that's coming in now from television rights, there's no need for them to be greedy. Look after the supporters; make sure they can still afford to go and watch football.","You never know how long a player has left, especially with strikers. Once you turn 30, as a striker, you are usually on the way down, and playing from the age of 16, at such a high level, has to take its toll.","Personal records are not what football is all about, but as goalscorers, we live and die by figures and numbers because, ultimately, that's how people will judge you.","The E.U. has its weaknesses, but it's been pretty good for us, and it's been pretty good for Europe, and it's kept peace.","As footballers, you just grow up with people from different backgrounds and different colors of skin.","I sort of fall apart in terms of stamina after about 25 minutes!","Presenting football is something that I love to do. I'm very fortunate being able to do one of the BBC's flagship shows.","We're all concerned about sports rights being so expensive. Obviously, we are funded by the licence fee payers, so it's not always easy to compete with those who can get greater revenue.","I think medically, football is generally well looked after. There are always checks made. Anything which can be done to make footballers or sportsmen of any area safer has to be encouraged.","I don't think there was a definite day, but it would have been around my mid-20s. I was always interested in the media side of things. When we travelled with England away, or to World Cups, I used to sit with journos while they wrote their copy.","When Bob Wilson left the BBC for ITV, I got the 'Football Focus' job, and it went from there. It came completely out of the blue, but the fact I had a high profile certainly helped.","World Cups can be career-defining.","Looking at the way the game is played, I'm envious of the conditions. We played on some ropey World Cup surfaces. I genuinely never look back and wish I earned the money they do today, but I do think of that element.","That's what being a footballer is, really: you train at this time, you finish at that time, then you do that, then you go home, then you're not allowed out, then you do this... there comes a point in your career - about thirty, thirty-one - when you get a bit sick of being screamed at.","If I hadn't have been good enough at football, I'd have been a sports journalist - which is what I do now anyway. Or a cricketer. I might have been a cricketer.","I watched Leicester City lose in the 1969 FA Cup final with my dad and granddad when I was eight and cried all the way home. I have seen them get promoted and relegated. I played for them for eight years. I even got a group of like-minded fans and friends to stump up a few quid to salvage the club when they went into liquidation.","I generally have a brand of brief on every day.","There is Twitter outrage at everything. Be it a pair of trousers or a short skirt, somebody, somewhere, will not like it.","I've got about 5 million followers on Twitter, and if I tweet anything, there will be faux outrage."],"Gary Locke":["Ethnic diversity adds richness to a society.","We've come a long way since Nixon's first visit to China, or Carter's reestablishment of diplomatic relations.","China's history is marked by thousands of years of world-changing innovations: from the compass and gunpowder to acupuncture and the printing press. No one should be surprised that China has re-emerged as an economic superpower.","Americans are very easygoing people. If the added attention and great visibility that I have been able to generate can help open doors and expose more Chinese to American values and the American way of life, that is great.","Diversity of thought and culture and religion and ideas has been the strength of America.","For generations, people have come to U.S. shores to seek opportunity. It's what my grandfather did a century ago, when he came to Seattle, and worked as a houseboy just one mile from the Washington State governor's mansion that I was privileged to inhabit for eight years.","I've been through WTO riots in Seattle, massive earthquakes, major floods... forest fires. I just try to be as even-keeled and calm as possible.","On top of my to-do list in preparing for Beijing is 'On China' by Henry Kissinger, who has had firsthand experience with every top Chinese leader since Mao, so his insights are valuable and his access is perhaps unrivaled.","I'm so proud of my Chinese ancestry, but I was born and raised in America, and I really believe in American values, our American system, our freedom, our liberties.","If the Chinese can't buy U.S. products, they'll buy them from European countries and then develop stronger economic ties with France and Germany and perhaps side more with those countries when international issues flare up.","The U.S. tries to provide immigrants who grow up here with a world-class education and imbue them with the can-do attitude that has long defined American innovation.","The explosive growth in places like Shanghai has helped lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and into a thriving new middle class. What China has done is nothing short of an economic transformation, and the citizens of this country have every right to be proud.","If we expose the Chinese to our freedoms, it may create a greater hunger for democracy, reform and liberties in China.","I'm somewhat overwhelmed by the microblogging that takes place in China, and the smartphones and all the people that want to take pictures of myself and my family.","In rural parts of China, it's like stepping back into the era of my grandfather or great-grandfather - not much has changed.","One of the last books I read was 'Game Change: Obama and the Clintons, McCain and Palin, and the Race of a Lifetime' by John Heilemann and Mark Halperin. It gives a really good behind-the-scenes look at the campaigns. I didn't ask the president how accurate it was. I wouldn't ask him that.","I confess to loving a good murder mystery - anything by Scott Turow or John Grisham. Maybe it's a holdover from my days as a criminal prosecutor in Seattle.","I consider myself a D.I.Y. home improvement guy. In a prior life, I completely gutted a house - redid the plumbing, wiring, moved sewage pipes, knocked down walls, everything.","I think that people always just assumed that I was a liberal because I came from Southeast Seattle.","China is a country, still, of great contrast. While hundreds of millions of people are part of the middle class and yearn for things made in America - American brands, movies, music - there are other hundreds of millions of people throughout China who are living on the equivalent of one U.S. dollar a day.","I think that there is a concern, a question mark, by people all around the world and governments all around the world, as to what China's intentions are.","As President Obama clearly said just a few months ago, China must play by the international rules, the international trading system from which they've benefited so much.","The human rights record within China seems to rise and fall over time, but it's very clear that in the run up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics and since then, there's been a greater intolerance of dissent and the human rights record of China has been going in the wrong direction.","The constant influx of new cultures, new ideas and new ways of looking at old problems is a big part of the reason why America has been the most dynamic economy in the world for well over a century.","Every year, some 65,000 high school students - many of them star students and leaders in their communities - are unable to go to college or get a good job because they have no legal status.","I understand that in these difficult economic times, the potential for any additional expense is not welcomed by American businesses. But in the long run, the health insurance reform law promises to cut health-care costs for U.S. businesses, not expand them.","We want to promote people-to-people exchanges so that China and the United States can really join together, not just to solve the problems of China or the United States, but some of the big problems facing the entire world. From climate change to famine to even terrorism.","My dad, of course, like a lot of Asian parents, wanted me to be an engineer or doctor and never could understand why I would want to be a lawyer. And then, when I first said I wanted to run for office, he thought that was absolutely insane.","The growth model China has relied on for the last 30 years - one predicated on low-cost exports to the rest of the world and investment in resource intensive heavy manufacturing - is unlikely to serve it well in the next 30 years.","China's own recent history proves that when it opens itself, there is nothing its people cannot accomplish. A more open China will lead to a more prosperous and stable China. That's good for China, the United States and, indeed, the entire world.","All the states are required, either by constitution or by statute, to have balanced budgets - they're not able to print money. So they have to focus on establishing priorities.","We need the private sector to succeed, because if the private sector succeeds, America succeeds. Because it's not the government that produces jobs, it's the private sector.","We welcome Chinese investment in the United States with open arms."],"Gary Lockwood":["I don't watch television. I'm not a TV guy.","I finally bought a gun because I said if I'm going to get it, I'm taking somebody with me.","I'm a typical California boy.","Star Trek wouldn't die. There were a whole lot of young people who were touched by the thought process of science fiction. If you watched a cop show, there wasn't anything that was going to stimulate your mind."],"Gary Lucas":["The ability and desire to transform the mundane materials at hand that we both bring into the collaboration well beyond the sum total of the parts - to birth a new baby neither of us could claim single parentage of.","I actually spend very little time listening to any new music.","I don't think so, in so far as I always aspired to play the way I do now but just couldn't get the sounds out always due to technical limitations - now I can pretty much play what I hear in realtime.","I have no doubt that there are great people about though... the thing of it is, nothing to this day moves me like classical music (Debussy, Vaughn Williams).","I have to plead basic ignorance of most new jazz artists here.","Maybe its a case of one guitar feeling a certain way to the hands that makes one subsequently move differently over the strings, but my intent is always to wring the maximum emotional resonance out of the object in hand.","To make the bloody thing talk the way I do when I'm on a verbal roll, in my idioms and rhythms.","While I shared many of the same emotions Bill describes, in no way did my experience ever degenerate into the grimness I find in his book - I didn't have to live with Don, and I think that made a big big difference."],"Gary McCord":["I've forgotten more about bad putting than all the lousy putters in the firmament combined. My mind has been twisted into an incurable, disturbing venue of bad speed and inadequate line. I just want to go out and not feel like I'm putting a Rubik's Cube with a flimsy piece of rope.","He hits the ball a long way and he knows how to win.","He's got an overall flair for the game. It looks to me like he really loves what he does and he can't wait to get up in the morning, go hit some balls and go play.","I made nothing happen very slowly.","He's a threat to win until his brain turns to tapioca.","The first time I played a PGA Tour event at Tucson was 1975. I came off the course on Sunday feeling very good about myself. I'd finished at even par, and I knew I could play even better if I worked at it.","In Valdosta, Ga., during a mini-tour event, a player named James Black bet me $20 he could put five golf balls in his mouth and then close his mouth all the way. I tried it but could get only two in there.","Many years ago, in the throes of my struggles on the PGA Tour, I had difficulty even getting into pro-ams. I needed money, so I put together a 45-minute magic show I'd perform at corporate events surrounding the tournament.","My interest in magic was kindled by Steve Martin, the comedian I'd gone to high school with.","I hate to repeat lines, to say the same damned thing. I try to rewrite cliches and make what I say sound fresh.","Golfers don't scream. Golfers just adjust the pleats in their pants and go from there. That's about as antagonistic as we get.","I'm nearsighted in my right eye, have glaucoma in my left, and the nerves in my hands are on Medicare. Basically, I'm on the wrong end of a short sale.","If you are going to make a change, don't go halfway. Make it with conviction and stick with your new idea. Ignore the scoffers. Remember, it is a law of nature that if something is different you're going to be taunted, jeered, and told the world is flat. Let the doubters fall off the edge.","I don't putt face-on exclusively, but in the back on my mind I'm haunted by the notion that I'm sure it's the best way to putt."],"Gary Miller":["I became a general contractor in my early 20s. I have been in the business for over 35 years.","Today, currently, business owners can go out and find out if the person they are hiring is eligible to work here or if they are not. We need to think about how we are impacting workers.","Today more than 20,000 communities participate in the National Flood Insurance Program. More than 90 insurance companies sell and service flood service insurance. There are more than four million policies covering the total of $800 billion.","The United States' gasoline industry, as Hurricanes Katrina and Rita demonstrated, is remarkably fragile. And the process of how oil is pumped from the ground, turned into gasoline and distributed to consumers is complicated.","Rather than waiting to restore fiscal responsibility after we pass legislation, we must work to ensure we remain committed to it as we draft legislation.","Many talk about a guest worker program. I think most reasonable people believe that a guest worker program in the farming industry, perhaps in the gardening and landscape industries, is reasonable.","In the United States, oil demand is projected to grow by 340,000 barrels per day this year and gasoline demand is projected to grow nearly two percent, averaging 9.3 million barrels per day for the summer.","In 2001, America 's hospitals provided nearly $21 billion in uncompensated health care services.","In 1973, America imported 30 percent of its crude oil needs. Today, that number has doubled to more than 60 percent. Gas prices are as high as they are now in part because we've had no comprehensive national energy policy for the past few decades.","The price of crude oil accounts for 55 percent of the price of a gallon of gasoline, driven by global supply and demand. The United States depends on foreign sources of oil for 62 percent of our nation's supply. By 2010, this is projected to jump to 75 percent.","The National Flood Insurance Program is a valuable tool in addressing the losses incurred throughout this country due to floods. It assures that businesses and families have access to affordable flood insurance that would not be available on the open market.","The Asian nation's oil demand is expected to grow this year by 800,000 barrels per day and represents more than one-third of the total growth in global demand, according to the Energy Information Agency.","Hospitals must provide emergency treatment to all who walk through the door, regardless of their citizenship status or ability to pay.","Global crude oil demand is increasing, particularly in places like China.","Energy companies, such as Chevron and Shell, and oil producing countries, such as Kuwait and Venezuela, pump crude oil from their vast land holdings and sell it on the world market.","Emergency health care for illegal aliens along the southwestern border is already costing area hospitals $200 million a year, with perhaps another $100 million in extended care costs.","California has the highest number of illegal immigrants residing in its borders. The estimated number of illegal alien residents in California was about 2.2 million, or nearly 32 percent of the total number of illegal immigrants in the United States.","An estimated 7 million illegal immigrants were residing in the United States in January 2000. This is double the size of the illegal immigrant population in January 1990 and constitutes 2.5 percent of the total U.S. population of just over 281 million.","An American worker should not expect his pay to be cut because somebody comes to this country illegally and is willing to work for less than he or she should be paid.","A variety of factors contribute to the price of gasoline in the United States. These factors include worldwide supply, demand and competition for crude oil, taxes, regional differences in access to gasoline supplies and environmental regulations."],"Gary Neville":["I developed a mechanism so that whatever mistakes I made, I would bounce straight back. Whatever was happening off the pitch, I could put it to one side and maintain my form. Call it mental resilience or a strong mind, but that is what we mean when we talk about experience in a football team.","With good coaching, proper motivation and the right club structure with organic growth, you can achieve an awful lot in football.","A coach once told me there are four factors that determine a players' performance: his tactical awareness, his physical condition, his technical ability and his mental strength.","It is one of my pet hates when I see players who have agents who do everything for them. They don't know how to set up their own bank accounts, they don't know what they are spending their money on and they can't make their own decisions.","For sportsmen or women who want to be champions, the mind can be as important, if not more important, than any other part of the body.","When I was a child, the FA Cup was one of the crown jewels of the sporting year, along with the Grand National, Wimbledon and The Open. But with every announcement it seems to lose another piece of its identity. First it was sponsors added to the name, followed by the semi-finals at Wembley.","We have to win that game. But we have to win every game, that's the way it's always been.","A collection of strong-minded individuals who have learned how to dismiss mistakes, disappointments and problems in their personal life make up a strong team. If the majority of the team have that then, as a unit, you are almost impossible to beat.","One year's poor form remains a blip but if it happens next year, you can say it's a trend.","It will be a difficult couple of days. It's difficult now and it will be difficult tomorrow.","I have been a Manchester United fan all my life and fulfilled every dream I've ever had. I am disappointed that my playing days are at an end. However, it comes to us all and it's knowing when that time is and for me that time is now.","There have been times when I've reflected on my international career and just thought: 'Well that was a massive waste of time.' Sorry for sounding sour, but my best mate, David Beckham, got butchered after the World Cup in 1998, then my brother, Phil, after Euro 2000.","Playing for England was one long roller-coaster: some ups and downs, but also quite a few moments when you're not really sure if you're enjoying the ride.","The best managers out there at the moment are Pep Guardiola and Jose Mourinho but they are at other clubs - Real Madrid and Barcelona.","Ryan Giggs will go down as the most successful British footballer of all time and I cannot see anyone ever overtaking him. He's on the brink of his 13th league title, after all.","As football gets more globalised, it's probably more important than ever to have one or two players in your team who have grown up in the same streets or been to the same schools as the hard-core fans.","There are lots of concerns facing English football but for me the major one is the way in which football clubs are run by owners, whether they are growing organically and sustainably and how that is being policed by the football authorities.","I would have been about seven years old when the formative years of my competitive football education began. I was playing in the local leagues around Manchester, playing against lads from tough areas who had been taught they had to fight for everything.","We live in a multi-cultural society far more open to international ideas. If you'd told me 20 years ago I'd drive through Bury and see someone sitting outside a cafe drinking a latte, I'd have laughed. In fact, I wouldn't have even known what a latte was.","In my 20 years in football, I was fortunate enough never to have experienced relegation. And while there is the pressure of expectations at the top of the league, at the bottom it comes in fear and trepidation, which is almost worse.","Something interesting has happened over the last 10 years in the Premier League. Players who once would have been discarded as expensive and too old have become important parts of title-winning squads.","Nothing improves your confidence and brings a team together more than winning a cup.","There are some agents who do a good job looking after players but there are others who stifle and mollycoddle them."],"Gary North":["Socialism is simply Communism for people without the testosterone to man the barricades.","What the ten commandments set forth is a strategy. This strategy is a strategy for dominion.","This is God's world, not Satan's. Christians are the lawful heirs, not non-Christians.","Nevertheless, this one fact should be apparent: turning the other cheek is a bribe. It is a valid form of action for only so long as the Christian is impotent politically or militarily.","Do you really believe that the Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, plans to be a loser in history?","Satan cannot win. Why not? Because he has denied God's sovereignty and disobeyed God's law. But Moses was told explicitly, God's blessings come only from obedience. Satan will not win because he has abandoned God's tool of dominion, biblical law.","Jesus was not denying the legitimacy of biblical law. On the contrary, He was affirming biblical law. We love God first; God commands us to keep His word; therefore, we must enforce the law on ourselves.","Jesus Christ is our supreme commander, but He operates only through His word, which is unquestionably a training manual. However, He has many interpreters, and few people see the Bible as a true training manual."],"Gary Numan":["I'm hopeless at small talk and have a problem making eye contact.","I think if you are creative then it's an unstoppable thing. It just keeps coming throughout your entire life.","I honestly don't know what criteria makes someone right-wing or left-wing anymore. The boundaries of those definitions seem to be in a state of flux. I'm not socialist, I know that.","I'm very intolerant and I get fed up with people easily.","I collect fantasy swords, replicas from films, and have them displayed on the wall as you go up the stairs.","Album sales have collapsed, with few artists making money from albums; touring is more lucrative. But I'm 53 now and won't be able to tour forever, so a logical step is to get into writing film scores. Trouble is, you need to be somewhere which has a big film industry - another reason why I'm thinking about living in California.","I never call myself a singer, ever. I never will. I've always been really embarrassed about my voice. I've never been confident about it. I think it's a little bit better now than when I first started. There are people I admire who are genuinely brilliant singers and I know the difference between what they can do and what I can do.","I have always been far more interested in sound than technique, and how sounds work together, how they can be layered. I think electronic music, in its infancy anyway, allowed us to create music in a way that hadn't really been possible before. It created a new kind of musician.","If I thought that any of this was pre ordained, then it takes away any kind of incentive to struggle, or to put up with things, to reach for those impossible dreams, all those dramatic things.","There's no point in lying saying I am doing really, really well because I'm not; I'm cult level.","The industrial thing came about mainly through giving up trying to write pop songs in the early '90s. I don't think I was ever very good at pop music and as soon as I stopped trying, and started to write more the things I loved, it became much heavier and more aggressive.","I've got Asperger's syndrome and I'm not a very good people person, so I've always been more comfortable around machinery. Not in a weird way - I don't want to marry my car or anything stupid like that!","I have a condition called Aspergers Syndrome, which is like a mild form of autism It means I don't interact properly in certain social situations.","When you decide to do this kind of music then you just accept the facts.","I genuinely don't know how many albums I'm going to sell when the new album comes out, because I honestly don't know how many fans I've actually got at the moment.","And I used to go the punk clubs such as a gay club in Poland Street that everyone would go to because it was the only place you could go to looking like that without getting beaten senseless.","I'd been a Bowie fan before punk and used to get no end of trouble. I was always getting knocked about and having to run up the street, getting chased by people. It was horrible.","I don't believe in sharing my money. If I go out and work my nuts off and make some money, I don't feel that I should have to share it with my community.","Being a display pilot is probably the thing I've been most proud of in my life. Don't really fly anymore now though. I have three small children and as most of my friends were killed in different accidents, I realised that it was probably just a matter of time before I went that way.","I think any song should sound good just played on a solitary instrument with the vocal. If you have those basics you have all you need. The production then just polishes that idea into the finished thing.","I much prefer touring to anything else. Studio work is great, and can be hugely satisfying, but live work has the excitement and the lifestyle that I love.","I want to start my own airplane business. I'm going to buy two Dakotas, paint them up in war colours and do, er, nostalgia trips to Arnhem - you know, where the old paratroopers used to go - and charge them about 20 quid a time.","I got involved in music because I love everything about it, but now I'm in it you see the other side and it isn't much fun. Not as glamorous and enjoyable as you imagine.","I've always considered myself to be fiercely patriotic. I love Britain - its history and the down-to-earth attitude people have.","I've spent a lot of time in the United States and I'm not under any illusions that it's a crime-free nirvana. I'm well aware it has plenty of problems, though they seem to be associated with particular areas.","I became famous so quickly and so young - it was daunting. I was immature and I used to say some really stupid things in interviews. I never smiled on stage so I looked really serious, but it was because I hated my teeth and was incredibly nervous.","I would never take part in one of those Eighties nostalgia tours, although I've been asked many times, because it's like admitting you have nothing new to offer. As long as I can keep making music I'm happy with, and people want to come to my gigs to hear it, I'll carry on.","My dad was a baggage handler at Heathrow and careful with money. He worked hard and had three jobs when I was young. I wish I'd inherited his care for money. Sadly, I've grown up to be rather scatty when it comes to finances.","Before breaking into music, I had various jobs: forklift driver, driving a courier. But I was forced into working rather than doing it off my own bat because that was my dad's way: you got a job and paid your way.","Fame came quickly. I was only 19 when I secured my initial recording contract and my first two hit records - 'Are 'Friends' Electric?' and 'Cars' - were number ones.","I always say it took me 10 minutes to write 'Cars,' but if I am honest it could have been even less than that - and it has been a really successful song over the years. It is still massively used, in advertising, in films, and people do cover versions of it a lot.","When I was a kid it was big news when someone flew around the world in a little aeroplane, but nobody cared when I did it. Then, to rub salt into my wounds, the customs people ripped my aeroplane to pieces, looking for stuff.","I am very old-fashioned about marriage. It is for life and I mean it. I always knew that when I met the right girl, the life I had before - being single, in a band, girls everywhere - would be over.","'Are 'Friends' Electric?' was two songs: the verse part and the talking part. Two different songs I couldn't finish. One day I was playing the main verse part of 'Are 'Friends' Electric?' and after a few minutes I got frustrated, as normal, then started to play the other song, and realized they went together.","I'm very into science-fantasy, that kind of swordfights and magic and technology thing.","I did an album a long time ago called 'Replicas,' which was entirely science-fiction driven, or science-fantasy. Since then it's been a song here, a song there. It's not really a constant theme. I've written far more about my problems with religion, with God and all that.","I'm not good at happy, lightweight kind of music. I'm not really good at pop music. 'Cars' is probably the only true pop song I ever wrote. I wish I could write more, but I'm not very good at it.","Ultravox were the blueprint for what I wanted to do, but I stumbled across them by accident.","When I went to record my first album, which should have been a punk album, there was a synthesiser in the control room. I'd never seen one before but they let me have a go on it and I loved it to bits.","When I was 11 I became a massive fan of The Monkees. We had a so-called 'band' of kids on my street and we'd go along to people's houses and mime to Monkees records.","Strangely enough, when the Sugababes' 'Freak Like Me' went to number 1, which was built around my 'Are 'Friends' Electric' song, I had another song called 'Rip' go to number 1 in the Kerrang TV chart, so I was pulling new people in from very different areas of musical interest. That was quite an amazing week.","I just didn't make music that you could sing with a big grin, still don't.","I was a loner as a child and happiest at home, launching toy rockets and aeroplanes. When I started causing trouble in my third year at grammar school, Mum was really surprised. My parents sent me to a child psychologist, who suggested I might have Asperger's syndrome.","I have one brother, John, an airline pilot, who is seven years younger. He's adopted, though we're still blood related - he's my cousin. My parents couldn't have any more children after me, so when Dad's brother died, they adopted John, then just a baby.","I met Gemma, my wife, when she was 12. She had a schoolgirl crush on me and her dad had arranged for her to meet me. Later, she started coming to my concerts, but I only got to know her well after her mother died. I rang to see how she was, and that's how it started.","In the mid-1980s to the early 1990s I was writing songs not because I particularly liked what I was doing, but because I was desperately trying to get back into the charts. I really didn't enjoy it. I didn't like the music I was making, I wasn't proud of it, like I have been before or since.","Any time anyone says anything nice about me, whether it's Lady Gaga or your neighbor, it's a nice feeling, I'm very grateful for it. It's very helpful for your career. Every time someone says something complimentary it introduces you to their audience. It gives you credibility.","Song-writing is therapy for me. I'm a very moody person, very difficult to live with. There's a lot going on and a lot of contradictions. My life is always one step away from disaster.","I'd see an old person on the street and start crying. I couldn't understand how people could cope, knowing they only had so long left. It would be like dominoes and then the last one fell and I'm a little heap on the floor. Doctors put me on anti-depressants for a couple of years.","I wouldn't say I'm vain - I'm just in a job where the way you look is important. Well, at least the facelift wasn't vanity, but the hair was.","It seems no matter what you say and how politically correctly and carefully you say it, you offend someone. Or at least I always do.","I was always a bit different. I had a very happy childhood, but I could never hang on to mates.","I sometimes wonder if I might be a bit of a disappointment to people, because they are expecting all these '80s hits and what they get is a dark industrial wall of noise.","Maybe I over-do the 'not-80s' thing. It should be a part of my life that I've got some sort of pride in, but I've got this huge chip on my shoulder about '80s nostalgia - and it annoys fans sometimes.","There does seem to be a kind of split. There are those people who are more entrenched in the early electronic years, and new people who have come to it because of people like Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson.","If you've been massive and it's all slid away, you tend to get written off. It's quite difficult to overcome that, which is why I've got this problem with nostalgia.","The idea of collaborating with anyone else was quite daunting. If Battles had any trepidation in asking me, I can assure you I had more after agreeing to do it.","I'm very lucky in the sense that I've got a voice that's distinctive. Not good, but distinctive. That's a very useful thing to have in this business. I'm glad on the one hand that I've got it, but I wish it was more powerful. I wish I had a greater range. I wish it was more accurate at times.","I became an air display pilot. I used to teach it. I was an examiner for a few years as well. It was great fun. I would still be doing it now if pretty much everyone I knew who was doing it hadn't died. In the first team I joined there were six people in it. By the time I stopped, there was only me and one other left - everyone else had died."],"Gary Oldman":["People who know me, they know I have a sense of humor, I'm a bit of a joker, a bit of a clown really, and I would love someone to exploit that side of me and send me a romantic comedy.","You choose your friends by their character and your socks by their color.","There's no handbook for parenting. So you walk a very fine line as a parent because you are civilizing these raw things. They will tip the coffee over and finger-paint on the table. At some point, you have to say, 'We're gonna have to clean that up because you don't paint with coffee on a table.'","Wanting to be a good actor is not good enough. You must want to be a great actor. You just have to have that.","The thing a drama school can't give you is instinct. It can sharpen instinct but that can't be taught, and you have to have intuition. It's an essential ingredient.","Political correctness has become a straightjacket.","I drank for about 25 years getting over the loss of my father and I took the anger out on myself. I did a good job at beating myself up at sometimes. I don't drink anymore but my alcoholic head occasionally says different. 'Nil By Mouth' was a love letter to my father because I needed to resolve some issues in order to be able to forgive him.","And of course I've got kids of my own now, and they love me being in the Harry Potter films. I'm now part of a phenomenon. You become incredibly cool to your kids, and you get a young fan base. So you became the cool dad at school. You're suddenly hip.","I was quiet, a loner. I was one of those children where, if you put me in a room and gave me some crayons and a pencils, you wouldn't hear from me for nine straight hours. And I was always drawing racing cars and rockets and spaceships and planes, things that were very fast that would take me away.","Reality TV to me is the museum of social decay.","Interesting things come your way but as you get older, your lifestyle changes. I don't want to travel; I don't want to be in a hotel room away from my family.","My passion and energy get mistaken for anger.","What other people think of me is none of my business.","Getting sober was one of the three pivotal events in my life, along with becoming an actor and having a child. Of the three, finding my sobriety was the hardest thing.","I don't go to premieres. I don't go to parties. I don't covet the Oscar. I don't want any of that. I don't go out. I just have dinner at home every night with my kids. Being famous, that's a whole other career. And I haven't got any energy for it.","Rather like Batman, I embody the themes of the movie which are the values of family, courage and compassion and a sense of right and wrong, good and bad and justice.","I like a cheese and pickle. Nice cheese and pickle on a real old-fashioned bread. Ploughman's lunch.","I know what it means to do a job... I worked in a factory. I respect people in the service industry. What irritates me more is when people aren't respectful. There's a lot of nonsense behavior, especially in a place like Hollywood. The money, the power, they create little monsters.","What's fascinating is that when you write a script, it's almost a stream of consciousness. You have an idea that it means something, but you're not always sure what. Then when you get on the set, the actors teach you.","Well, I needed the work - that's the honest answer. I haven't worked for a while, a couple of years. So I thought it would be nice to get back to work and earn some money.","I wanted to play Dracula because I wanted to say: 'I've crossed oceans of time to find you.' It was worth playing the role just to say that line.","My favorite meal would have to be good old-fashioned eggs, over easy, with bacon. Many others, but you can't beat that on a Sunday morning, especially with a cup of tea.","Your own barometer is all you have to go by, and often what makes a good director is knowing when not to say something. On occasions you can find yourself on a film set where the person who is wearing the director's hat is only trying to justify his position.","I did have a knack for playing weirdos. There's still sort of this perception of me out there as being this crazy guy.","And costume is so important for an actor. It absolutely helps to get into character; it's the closest thing to you, it touches you. Some actors like to go into make-up and then put their clothes on, but I like to dress first; that's my routine.","I had a guitar when I was 6 or 7, a plastic guitar with the Beatles' faces on it. It would be a collector's item now. It would fetch a hefty sum, I imagine.","It's always hard when you're playing someone for a lot of people out there who are going to see the movie after reading the books. There's a communion between a reader and the writer, so people will have an idea who Sirius Black is and I might not be everyone's idea of that.","People have an idea that one is in control of a career, a lot more than you really are. You can engineer things to an extent. But you are at the mercy of what comes in across the desk.","On set I keep myself to myself; I'd rather the director speak up. I'm not gonna direct a younger actor. I think the power of example works best, actually.","It's a shame about California, and particularly about L.A., where they've demolished so many landmarks. It's a bit of a disease there, where if anything is over 30 years old, they sort of knock it down and replace it. It's a strange town, it's this sprawling suburb, and then there's a city, the old town.","That's what sets apart one actor from another, and that you can't teach. You can't give someone that. When you're working, putting a character together, or in a scene, that's where things will happen that you have to have the intuition to notice them, and to register them.","I like celluloid, I like film, I like the way that when a movie is projected it sort of breathes a little in the gate. That's the magic of it to me.","I just think political correctness is crap.","At the Oscars, if you didn't vote for '12 Years a Slave,' you were a racist. You have to be very careful about what you say. I do have particular views and opinions that most of this town doesn't share, but it's not like I'm a fascist or a racist. There's nothing like that in my history.","When I decided that I might want to do acting for a living - I don't know where it really came from, since there was no school play or any of that - my mom gave me her blessing. I had to get a scholarship - that was the only way I could have gone to drama school.","Being an actor is a good way to earn a living. And to meet fabulous people. It's great to live very comfortably. I've been lucky, I've had a lot of fun with great roles, but it is true that if I were extremely rich, I would stop and I would go to play football on a beach in the Caribbean with my children.","I got obsessed with classical music, I got obsessed with Chopin, with playing the piano.","People imagine that actors are being offered everything and you are not. So things come in and sometimes there are things that I want and can't get a meeting on, or go to a different actors.","Speaking very generally, I find that women are spiritually, emotionally, and often physically stronger than men.","But you see, I have played more good guys than I have played villains.","Growing up in a particular neighborhood, growing up in a working-class family, not having much money, all of those things fire you and can give you an edge, can give you an anger.","How many movies do you see when you can say this director really knew what film he wanted to make? I can count them on the fingers of one hand.","I applaud anything that can take a kid away from a PlayStation or a Gameboy. That is a miracle in itself.","I hadn't worked for a couple of years so I thought it would be nice to earn some money and pay the bills.","I have three kids who like Harry Potter so I was sort of aware of it. You can't really move from it: it's on buses, in stores, it's everywhere. One of my kids has read the books; the other two are too small but they like the movies.","I never told my father I loved him before he died, and I have a lot of issues about that. They're all swimming around in my head, in my heart, unresolved, and in a way it felt fitting to dedicate the film to him.","I was brought up by my mother and my two sisters, although they're older than me and fled the nest very young, so I was technically raised as an only child, but I was very much loved.","I wasn't ever a huge fan of comics. Just not one of those kids, you know?","I'm not the best audience for that because I'm not a great science-fiction fan. I just never got off on space ships and space costumes, things like that.","If one could have a wish, or an alternative life, I would've liked to have been John Lennon.","It's becoming increasingly harder and harder; there's no such thing as independent film anymore. There aren't any, they don't exist. In the old days you could go and get a certain amount of the budget with foreign sales, now everybody wants a marketable angle.","My big love was the Beatles. I was more into music.","Shakespeare doesn't really write subtext, you play the subtext.","So Harry Potter came in and it is nice that I have kids of the right age. I took them to London and they walked around the set and met Harry Potter and that is thrilling.","I want my weekends off and I want to put my kids to bed. Those are good reasons to want to be in 'Batman 2'.","There will always be spies. We have to have them. Without them we wouldn't have got Osama bin Laden - it took us years, but it happened.","'Nil By Mouth' was a bit autobiographical, but as I always pointed out at the time, that's not my dad.","We lived in a flat that you could pretty much fit in my current kitchen. No wonder people drink! I can't understand why they don't throw themselves off the balconies.","I didn't do drugs. It wasn't my thing. But the drink was terrible. Today when I look back, it's like I was another person. You could call it a coping mechanism, but that would be an excuse. I just drank too much.","I had what AA calls 'a convincer' - which made me realize that I couldn't do it any more. I went out drinking for about 70 hours here in London. At the end I knew I was done.","I'm still a member of the Empire! Although I sometimes feel like an American with a British accent - you get contaminated after so long.","At 23 it was all about acting. Today it's getting my kids to school, making sure that they've done their homework. I'm in my fifties, and I'm turning into a square.","I don't think Hollywood knows what to do with me. I would imagine that when it comes to romantic comedies, my name would be pretty low down on the list.","Change is vital to any actor. If you keep playing lead after lead, you're really gonna dry up. Because all those vehicles wean you away from the truths of human behaviour.","I enjoy playing characters where the silence is loud.","I'm almost incapable of lying. I'd be a terrible spy.","I was never really that interested in the punk movement. I was a blues guy: I liked Motown, James Brown.","I grew up in Deptford in south London, and at that time I used to wear toppers, loon pants and tonic suits from shops like Take 6 and Topman. I was a bit of a soul boy, but I had a very eclectic taste in music - I was into James Brown and Bowie; and I was the only kid in the neighbourhood who would also be listening to Chopin.","As a drama student I got into Thirties and Forties suits.","It's funny: I'm a lifelong musician, but because I principally play the piano it's been a solitary thing.","I'm rarely asked to play the smartest man in the room.","I still don't have a publicist. If I'm in a film, you have an obligation to promote it, I'll do as much as I can.","Overall I enjoy a certain anonymity. I live a very normal, very ordinary life.","I took a bit of a back seat, I had kids and I wanted to focus on them. There's that period in the late '90s, the early 2000s, where I didn't do a great deal.","I tend to read non-fiction.","The building of America has had its fair share of mistakes, but it's a constitution that's the jewel of democracy, the envy of many, and it's the most generous nation in the world.","Over the years, I have been asked to play these sort of scary frenetic characters that express their emotions physically.","You can play older than yourself. You can play younger than yourself up to a point, and then that just becomes impossible because you carry a weight with you that you can't shift, unless you have very boyish looks.","You take what you know, and you put it through your own prism. If I play characters that break down or cry, it's Gary Oldman crying; it's not the character crying.","Culturally, politically, everywhere you look... Read the newspaper. Go online. Our world has gone to hell.","I'm probably a Libertarian, if I had to put myself in any category. But you don't come out and talk about these things, for obvious reasons.","A lazy man works twice as hard. My mother told that to me, and now I say it to my kids. If you're writing an essay, keep it in the lines and in the margins so you don't have to do it over.","I love the simple poetry of theater, where you can stand in a spotlight on a stage and wrap a coat around you, and say, 'It was 1860 and it was winter...'","I can't imagine childhood without 'Planet of the Apes.' I was nine or ten when the first one came out."],"Gary Owen":["I just want a big HBO special or a network or somebody willing to get behind my work and promote it. The most frustrating thing for me is to have this successful act that resonates across the country, and the network guys just don't get it. Everyone sees it except them. I want to leave a mark.","I always wonder if my kids will say they're mixed or black.","There's still people who think me being married to a sista is an act. What, you think I'd make that up for a persona?","Even if it's a white crowd, I tell my jokes for the four black people in the room, not the 100 whites.","There's no white comic that sells tickets to black people like me. They're going to get their hair done, get a new outfit, and come out to see a white dude.","Everything I do, I go to black people. If I have a problem at the airport, I'll go to the black ticket agent. I hope they notice me because I'll get better service. If I'm at a restaurant, I look for the black waiter. Rent-a-Car, give you the upgrade."],"Gary Owens":["Like I always tell people, I don't pander to any audience, but you have to play to your audience.","Then, when I got in the military, I used to host - even in high school - I hosted the talent shows, and when I was in the military I would host all of our base Christmas parties and stuff.","I'm not a mean comic, I don't want to turn anybody off - I just want to give a point of view or my take on things that everyone can laugh at.","My comedy isn't going to solve problems; I'm not that deep."],"Gary Paulsen":["I'm a teller of stories. I put bloody skins on my back and dance around the fire, and I say what the hunt was like. It's not erudite; it's not intellectual. I sail, run dogs, ride horses, play professional poker, and tell stories about the stuff I've been through. And I'm still a romantic; I still want Bambi to make it out of the fire.","In our family, we've always been owned by border collies, or dogs of one kind or another, and have rescued many dogs. We've lived in the woods and sometimes have had as many as 70 sled dogs. Or had six or seven dogs living in the house. Dogs have saved my life on more than one occasion - and I mean that literally.","You're never the same after you run the Iditarod, and I still lust to go out and run with dogs, even though I know that I shouldn't. But I'd give just about anything to be able to do it again. To see the horizon again from the back of a dog team would be wonderful.","Humans are the big thing that cause damage in life - in war or whatever - and if I can get away from that and into a wilderness situation, I'm OK. You can more or less live on your own merit.","I sail, run dogs, ride horses, play professional poker and tell stories about the stuff I've been through. And I'm still a romantic; I still want Bambi to make it out of the fire.","Yes, I've been in an igloo. They're surprisingly cozy and warm - small, though, you can't really stand up in some.","Name the book that made the biggest impression on you. I bet you read it before you hit puberty. In the time I've got left, I intend to write artistic books - for kids - because they're still open to new ideas.","Look at Inuit clothing. Their stuff still works better than Cabela's. I've made my own parkas, mukluks, footgear, and it is good to 60 degrees below zero. All I did was copy the patterns that came down from the Inuits.","Years ago, when I was writing westerns, other writers who were friends of mine wanted me to collaborate with them. And it just didn't work.","School didn't work for me. I hated it.","Adults are locked into car payments and divorces and work. They haven't got time to think fresh.","I ran the Iditarod twice. I finished once. I came in 42nd or 43rd place out of 70 plus teams the first time, and I scratched 80 miles from Nome the second time. You can read about my experience in the race in my books 'Woodsong' and 'Winterdance.'","I have a pickup truck. And I prefer to be with dogs or on my sailboat than in a car - actually, more than any other place on Earth.","My folks were drunks, and I had a rough childhood - really rough - in fact, rougher than I thought about.","The maximum expression of running dogs is the Iditarod. You enter a state of primitive exaltation, and you never return. You're never normal again.","A border collie saved me once when I was pinned under a horse in Colorado. And once when I went through the ice, one of my sled dogs saw me go under, and she got the rest of the team, and they pulled me out of 12 feet of water. I think that dogs offer the only form of unconditional love that's available to humans.","I was raised on farms by people who didn't have Wal-Mart. They had to make their own sleds, harnesses, clothing, etc.","I think that what computers have done is just disastrous to the language.","I don't have a favorite author; I have favorite books. 'Moby Dick' is a favorite book, but Melville was a drunk who beat his wife. 'Moveable Feast' by Hemingway, but I would not like him personally. He was a stupid macho person who believed in shooting animals for fun, but that book was incredible!","In sailing, I single-hand, and I want to do the Horn. The Horn is the maximum expression of sailing, the way the Iditarod is the maximum expression of running dogs. It's not to write about it; it's to experience the maximum thing.","My parents were brutal to each other, so I slept in the basement by an old coal-fired furnace. I became a street kid. Occasionally, I'd live with aunts or uncles, then I'd run away to live in the woods, trapping and hunting game to survive. The wilderness pulled at me; still does."],"Gary Peters":["I've always believed that the things middle class families struggle with around their kitchen tables should define my work in Washington.","Set politics and party aside: If it's not right for Michigan's small businesses and middle class, it's never been right with me.","People want someone focused on getting the job done, not political talking points but rather solving problems.","I take very seriously the notion that you have to get out in your community; you have to talk to people, but, more importantly, you have to listen to people."],"Gary Player":["The harder you work, the luckier you get.","Golf is a puzzle without an answer. I've played the game for 40 years and I still haven't the slightest idea how to play.","If there's a golf course in heaven, I hope it's like Augusta National. I just don't want an early tee time.","You must work very hard to become a natural golfer.","As we all know... golf is a puzzle without an answer.","I've traveled more than any human being who's ever lived.","We create success or failure on the course primarily by our thoughts."],"Gary Ross":["I mean, what is racism? Racism is a projection of our own fears onto another person. What is sexism? It's our own vulnerability about our potency and masculinity projected as our need to subjugate another person, you know? Fascism, the same thing: People are trying to untidy our state, so I legislate as a way of controlling my environment.","Really, each era has its own false nostalgia. We all put a picket fence up around something. For my generation it was the '50s, and for other generations it will be something else. Change is scary for everyone, as is complexity, contradiction, and an uncertain future.","As time goes by the memories of sitting on the edge of a bed and reading aloud with your kid are going to be very meaningful in your own mental scrapbook.","I wasn't going to make a slick, glossy over-produced piece of entertainment because then I would be doing what the Capitol did. Then I'm actually putting on the Hunger Games and not making a movie of the 'Hunger Games.'","Ultimately, so much Dr. Seuss is about empowerment. He invites us to disappear into our imagination and then blows the doors off what that can mean.","There's something so wonderful about writing in rhyme where it isn't just the meaning of the words, it's the music to the words and the shape and the sound.","There's nothing I'd rather do than sort of, you know, sit at my computer and rhyme.","History is full of examples of people who clamp down after they began to enjoy too much freedom. Freedom can lead to instability, anarchy, and confusion. So there can be a moral counter-revolution.","In a complex and troubling world, who wouldn't want to simplify? Everybody does. Everybody wants to simplify and put up a picket fence.","There are not many people on Team Gary. Actually, it's two people. My kids.","I think the CG is an instrument to create reality. I don't think it's an instrument to create a heightened reality.","Now, I just made an animated movie a few years ago, 'The Tale of Desperaux', and that had twelve hundred shots in it. Twelve hundred CG shots is a pretty big plan.","You have to listen to the movie while you're making it. I think that's important.","'Dr. Strangelove' was and is one of my favorite movies ever, and I just can't believe they actually blew up the world after that.","It's interesting - in 'Fail Safe,' as well, they didn't back off. We were raised with kind of this spectrum of that Armageddon and lived under it, so those were probably the films. 'Fail Safe' sort of haunted me.","Family entertainment is really very necessary in our culture. Look how profitable they are. It's almost not discretionary. You need to take your family to the movies.","Despite recent speculation in the media, and after difficult but sincere consideration, I have decided not to direct 'Catching Fire.' As a writer and a director, I simply don't have the time I need to write and prep the movie I would have wanted to make, because of the fixed and tight production schedule.","I loved making 'The Hunger Games' - it was the happiest experience of my professional life. Lionsgate was supportive of me in a manner that few directors ever experience in a franchise: they empowered me to make the film I wanted to make and backed the movie in a way that requires no explanation beyond the remarkable results.","Why is every great children's story about a journey? Maybe that's because we are always on one.","'Harry Potter' created a generation of readers in an era when kids could have disappeared into the depths of the Internet. That's no small feat. Every book series owes J.K. Rowling a debt of gratitude.","Most modern science fiction went to school on 'Dune.' Even 'Harry Potter' with its 'boy protagonist who has not yet grown into his destiny' shares a common theme. When I read it for the first time, I felt like I had learned another language, mastered a new culture, adopted a new religion.","I mean, the wonderful thing about writing a book is that you're getting a finished product at the end of the day. You're communicating directly with the reader.","I mean, in 'Big' and 'Pleasantville,' it's a journey that the characters go on where I think they come to kind of meet themselves at the end and who they actually are and give full voice to who they actually are. And that, you know, obviously fascinates me for some reason. Maybe I didn't adequately grow up.","I think movies do play a valuable role in turning people on to the act of reading. I think that phenomenon just creates readers. At first they're going to love 'Harry Potter,' or they may love 'The Hunger Games,' but after that, they're going to love the act of reading and wonder, 'What else can I read?'","You can't tell your kids to read if you're just watching television. They have to see you read. And in that respect, I think it's important to walk the walk. It's a wonderful shared time.","If there's a 13- or 14-year old kid who is yearning for something beyond the social forces in his own world, in his own neighborhood, the library is the only place where he can go to find that. It was exciting and thrilling to me all the time I worked in the library. It's such a force for social good and it can do so much.","People who want to be a star get their teeth capped. People who want to be an actor get to work.","I love 'Chaplin'; I mean I really love 'Chaplin.' I just think there's a grace and an elegance that's almost never been matched.","Obviously I love 'The Godfather' movies. I think they're phenomenal.","Any director, if you really ask them, will tell you that the toughest thing to do is like a dinner table or a dialogue scene, because you need to keep that electricity maintained throughout the course of the film.","If you look at the opening of 'Private Ryan,' you are so in the point of view of those guys and there is a whole world swirling all around them. You are learning that geography as they are learning it.","The great seats of power tend to be wide and open, not vertical and soaring. Red Square, Tiananmen Square, the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin - all massive but with large open spaces that project an image of might.","We repress the things we're scared of, but if we just look at and embrace the things we're scared of, it's a much fuller, richer life that's also not as scary.","I don't understand people who dream in black and white. I just don't get it. My dreams have always been vivid color.","You can drain the life and nuances and complexity out of things by homogenizing them to make everything harmoniously dull, flat, conflict-free, strife-free.","My '50s were different than other people's '50s. The myth didn't permeate our world, 'Donna Reed' and all that. I longed for that, I wanted to be like other normal families on TV.","'Pleasantville' seems tonally ambitious, but it can handle a wide breadth of tone because it's so fanciful.","I tend to love actors. I was trained as an actor first so I'm drawn to actors.","The dynamic range of a digital camera is not that much greater than film, particularly if you push the ASA a little bit.","I love design-based stuff. I dug it in 'Pleasantville' and dug it in 'Seabiscuit.'","Horseracing already has the highest mortality rate of any sport in the world per capita to the people who do it. If you crash in Nascar you still have a roll bar, and a cage, and a lot of protection. It's built to crash, but if you fall off a racehorse we all know what can happen, so it's tremendously dangerous.","What works about fairy tales is that they endure, and the great thing about fairy tales is that you can explore big, epic things that you can't really explore in other situations."],"Gary Rossington":["I've always heard that the reason you fall is to get back up and keep going. So when that happens, or life throws you bad breaks or curves or deals you the wrong hand, all I've ever known is to keep going.","We wore blue jeans and T-shirts. Our music was our gimmick.","Our redneck reputation back then was originally just because we had long hair. Back in the '60s and the early '70s, in the South that was kind of a no-no. At all the Army and Navy bases we'd play, we would get into fights with the soldiers over our hair. But I think our music overshadowed everything else.","I could write a dozen different songs with the same three or four chords, but they'd all be entirely different.","The only reason we used the Confederate flag was just because we were from the South, and we were proud of that.","You have to learn to live with the hard things in life and go on.","We want to challenge Marilyn Manson and the rap people with the bad lyrics to write some positive songs.","If Marilyn Manson would write a song that says, 'Do your damn homework,' it would make the world a better place, and it wouldn't hurt him at all. And if he doesn't like it, to hell with him. He can come fight us - by the bicycle racks.","Through the years, people like the KKK and skinheads kinda kidnapped the Dixie or Southern flag from its tradition and the heritage of the soldiers.","Keith Moon was the funniest guy around. The stuff he did was insane. He was like somebody straight out of the movies.","Buffalo Springfield had three guitar players, and we thought they were so cool. So we started doing the three-guitar thing, and people started calling us the 'guitar army' and all this stuff.","Sometimes music isn't the way to talk politics, you know?","I've always used the Peavey Mace equipment. I've got a few of them. They're kind of like Marshalls. You know, we used to use Marshalls, but Peaveys just seem to last longer and push the sound better.","I've got two lives. Weekends, I go out and play rock star. Weekdays, I play granddad. You can't beat that.","I think that 'God & Guns' turned out a little more 'country' than we wanted it to be.","As long as the fans keep wanting to hear new records from us every few years, we'll keep making them.","We wanted to be America's Rolling Stones, to be the biggest band over here.","We were kinda rebels. From the wrong side of the tracks. Down where we were raised, it was a tough town.","I sound like an old bullfrog when I sing.","With life and grandkids and the whole thing, every day is busy, but I'm so thankful to God that I'm still here.","I'm feeling real good and trying to take care of myself and living healthy. As good as I can feel.","It's really weird when we're out of the country, whether we're in Brazil or Greece or some crazy place like France or Germany. When you hear your song on the radio or in a store, and you're in a different country, it's really freaky and surreal.","We didn't have much money when I was younger, so I had to collect Coke bottles and cash them in and get a paper route to afford a guitar. That guitar from Sears came with a case and an amp and everything all in one. It was really cool.","I love Eric Clapton and what he did with Cream; 'Spoonful' and 'Crossroads,' those are probably the coolest solos.","Jimi Hendrix's 'Electric Ladyland' and 'All Along the Watchtower,' those solos are just so cool.","I did get in a car wreck, but we got a good song out of it.","I've had some heart problems, and I'm on the straight and narrow.","All we lived for was playing and being out on the road. That was our dream, and it came true.","I don't know if anybody will ever be as good as Hendrix again.","Everybody's got a right to their own opinion, you know?","We're a rock n' roll band. We're more music and rock n' roll than politics.","For one reason or another, the good God has left me on this planet; surely, I will not sit around and not do what I do naturally.","Man, I love Limp Bizkit, Johnny Lange, many people.","'Freebird' is an anthem, and 'Simple Man' is a very nice song.","If we do not play 'Alabama,' our fans would kill us.","We know what the Dixie flag represents and its heritage; the Civil War was fought over States rights.","There's only seven chords, so you got to use the same ones over and over. It's all in what you do with them.","The more wild experiences you have, the better songs you can write.","We used to travel through Alabama a lot and get onto back roads and just marvel at how pretty it was and how nice the people were.","In Lynyrd Skynyrd, we always got our recognition.","I think people who really want to do something do it. No matter what. And they won't quit until they do it.","Our parents helped us, or we wouldn't be here. Lacy Van Zant and my mother used to sign for amps or loan us money to get to the gig or take us in their car. It's just like little sports guys - Little League and football players - whose parents help them. That's why they get good.","The first time we ever used the Dixie flag for our backdrop was actually when we went over to Europe in 1970. It looked good, so we all liked it. We never meant any racial things by it.","Nothing in the past is as important as the future.","I just take every day on faith.","You go through stuff, and you keep going.","We're not preachers, but we say, 'Let's try and change things.'","To see fans singing our songs and loving them and dancing or crying to some of them, it feels like the first time you ever played it. It really gets to you, like day one.","Jacksonville back in the 1960s was kind of a redneck town. There were only two or three places where you could play our kind of hard rock - or 'hippie music' as it was called back then. You had to go to Georgia or some place else.","We keep our music simple, no big gimmicks. We tell stories people can relate to, not hard to understand.","I think we're a working man's band.","God blessed us with talent.","Old-school rock bands, and blues bands, too, are kind of a dying breed.","We're not really for anything but a better America, a stronger country. And we do support our soldiers.","If you can write a song that makes people have emotions and show their feelings, that's a powerful thing and a beautiful thing.","We loved Neil Young and all the music he's given the world.","I love being Southern because of the people and the fans we have. People down here are more friendly - really warm people.","We travel all over the world, and it seems like the South is the place where the people are nicest and they think of the fellow man more.","We started playing 'Free Bird' in clubs, and initially, it was just a slow ballad."],"Gary Ryan Blair":["Self-discipline is an act of cultivation. It requires you to connect today's actions to tomorrow's results. There's a season for sowing a season for reaping. Self-discipline helps you know which is which.","You cannot afford to wait for perfect conditions. Goal setting is often a matter of balancing timing against available resources. Opportunities are easily lost while waiting for perfect conditions.","Do more than is required. What is the distance between someone who achieves their goals consistently and those who spend their lives and careers merely following? The extra mile.","We only live once, but once is enough if we do it right. Live your life with class, dignity, and style so that an exclamation, rather than a question mark signifies it!","Discipline is based on pride, on meticulous attention to details, and on mutual respect and confidence. Discipline must be a habit so ingrained that it is stronger than the excitement of the goal or the fear of failure.","Thoughtless risks are destructive, of course, but perhaps even more wasteful is thoughtless caution which prompts inaction and promotes failure to seize opportunity.","Your future takes precedence over your past. Focus on your future, rather than on the past.","Your mind, while blessed with permanent memory, is cursed with lousy recall. Written goals provide clarity. By documenting your dreams, you must think about the process of achieving them.","Advancement only comes with habitually doing more than you are asked.","Creative risk taking is essential to success in any goal where the stakes are high. Thoughtless risks are destructive, of course, but perhaps even more wasteful is thoughtless caution which prompts inaction and promotes failure to seize opportunity.","Money is always on its way somewhere. What you do with it while it is in your keeping and the direction you send it in say much about you. Your treatment of and respect for money, how you make it, and how you spend it, reflect your character."],"Gary Sheffield":["If I'm coming in at 4:00 in the morning and my kids have been in bed since 8:00, 9:00, that's not setting a good example. The responsibility that I have kids inside my household has made me realize now that I have to be an example.","My dad's a bodybuilder. My whole life I've been taught to train the hard way. I believe in earning strength, not buying it. My grandfather raised me old school: In baseball, you work for whatever you get.","The owners have the right to pay you whatever they want to. They don't have to pay you if they don't want to.","Well, everybody is trying to make this a money thing. If you send me to another team, let's see what I ask for. I won't ask for nothing. I'll play under the same terms. So it is not Gary wants more money. Gary has money. What else do I need?","I trust no one totally.","I wanted to retire after I played for the Mets. My family said wait one year, that there was no need to rush it. I gave it a year and now it's time to say goodbye.","I am sure it will be mentioned and debated but from my standpoint I know who is in the Hall of Fame. A lot of them don't belong in the Hall of Fame. If someone wants to debate me, check the stats.","I thought I knew there was a God. I always acknowledged that, but at the same time, I didn't live by those laws.","This is what people don't understand. When they might see me do something that's not 'God-like,' then they say, 'Well, I thought you were saved?' I am saved. I'm not perfect. I have emotions still. My name's still Gary. These things here are not all cleaned up. I'm showing you my path.","Regardless of what you're searching, you ain't gonna find it until you include God. Because, if you have a problem with women, drugs, or whatever the case may be, the only person that can fix that problem is God.","Black players had an issue with Joe Torre. They weren't treated like everybody else. Even I got called out in a couple of meetings that I thought was unfair.","If you're equally good as this Latin player, guess who's going to get sent home? I know a lot of players that are home now can outplay a lot of these guys.","Derek Jeter used to come to me and try to tell you what Joe Torre is all about, he's a good man, he's this, he's that, but like I tell Derek Jeter, that's you. It's one thing that they treat you a certain way; you don't feel what other people feel.","I tell myself every offseason I'm not going to say anything crazy. I'm just going to have a peaceful season... Can't do it. I'm cut from a different cloth.","Most people figured I'd be in jail. I've been proving people wrong my whole life.","When you see Major League Baseball putting academies in other countries, obviously that throws up a red flag. You wonder why they ain't going up in our neighborhood. Bottom line, what I see, I talk about... I see it over and over. If anybody can show me I'm wrong, then show me.","I've played for teams that were family-oriented organizations. They made you feel like family. The Yankees are strictly a business. Baseball is your life and everything else is secondary.","When you challenge me, I like my chances in a fistfight. On the field, I use the same approach. I'm going to win. And I'll do it by any means necessary. If you're not willing to go that route, don't come my way.","The rage was in me, and if it wasn't for the rage, then I wouldn't know how to be calm. They feed off of each other. Just like when Malcolm X fed off Martin Luther King. They needed each other.","I've been the best player on every team that I played on, so if I can't be the poster child of your team, then what else is it? It's got to be a black-white issue. Every white player I know who's the best player on their team is the poster child of that team.","I had no interest in steroids. I didn't need them, and I didn't want them. I never wanted them. From the get-go, I've frequently mouthed off about their negative impact on the game.","When McGwire started the home run mania, attendance came back. The owners understood that the sudden spike in homers wasn't accidental. All baseball knew it. But baseball is run on money, and home runs meant money. Baseball turned a blind eye.","In L.A., wives can fly on the plane; with the Yankees, they can't. With other teams, the wives always have functions to bring them together. Not here. You don't know what half the wives look like.","I don't trust that many people. Just my mother and my wife and a couple of friends. When I trust people, it doesn't end well.","I'm not one of those people who have to try and remember what they told people, because I always tell the truth. That should count for something, right?"],"Gary Sherman":["I grew up in Albany Park in Chicago and then went to Lake View High School.","I have this data bank garbage can in the back of my head that is an emotional collection of events that have occurred in my life.","I was an outsider as a kid, and I grew up around a lot of violence.","I know what it is like to fear violence. I understand the adrenalin rush that comes before violent confrontations. I write my scripts from an emotional point of view and direct so the audience can experience this adrenalin rush.","One of the great things going on in Chicago is the educational facilities here. And the largest film school in the world is right here in Chicago: Columbia College.","Having been subjected to the pigeonholing of Hollywood myself, I realized that once you become a studio-approved director, your chances of ever making your own film again are zero. You make the films that the studio wants you to make.","The whole idea of 'Death Line' was to kind of highlight class distinctions in England more than to make a scary movie, and I just kind of wrapped my political treatise of the class distinctions in England in this movie.","The gruesomeness of 'Death Line' was an absolute necessity for me to bring up the political content of the film. I wanted to show how devastating class distinction could be.","'Vice Squad' needed to be real if it was going to have the impact that I wanted it to have.","I think that we, as a civilization, need to sit down and figure out how to solve political problems over a table, not over a battlefield.","I'm very much against war; I'm very much against terrorism of any kind. I find terrorism to be one of the most appalling things that can exist in society.","I am anything but a misogynist - I am quite far to the other side of that.","You get an audience to laugh and then show them something horrific, it's going to be even more horrific because they've had the release of the laugh before it.","Working with Jack Albertson was one of my great joys.","I love making movies, but a movie becomes your entire life for, like, two to two and a half years. There's no way around it; if you're really going to be serious about a movie, it has to be your life.","Television offered me the opportunity to do new things; I had written a lot of scripts other than scary movies. I had actually written some romantic comedies and stuff that I really wanted to try my hand at, and nobody would let me do that. Television allowed me to do anything I wanted.","In feature films, unless there was a body count, they weren't hiring me to direct it.","'Lisa' was a film that I am really proud of and is probably hopefully going to be remade."],"Gary Shteyngart":["The best thing about the iPhone is this that tells me where I am all the time. There's never a need to feel lost anymore.","When civilization takes a nose dive, how can you look away? You've got to be there. You've got to be at the bottom of the swimming pool taking notes.","Communications devices were always used to effect change, to effect revolution. Telephone, telegraph - these all seemed like very big enhancements at the time.","I think what will happen is that fiction will become more like poetry. As in, the only people who read it will write it.","I'd love to have a 19th Century Russian book club where all the members had to act like the pretentious minor noblemen they were reading about.","I write almost entirely in bed or on a couch with my feet up on the coffee table. I feel most creative when I'm looking out the window, and my bed and couch have nice views of the New York skyline.","I don't have many possessions, apart from my books.","In America, everyone writes but no one reads. Everyone's writing all day long - sending emails, tweets, text messages; they all think they're James Cameron's Avatar, performing in some video game for which they make up the script.","That's what I always liked about science fiction - you can make the world end. Humour is my multiple warhead delivery system.","If I still lived in Russia, I'd be dead... or a really effective oligarch.","I was very, very sick when I was growing up in Russia. The ambulance constantly came to our house. I had horrible asthma that is easily treated in America, but they didn't even have inhalers back in Russia.","I just want fiction to remain a vital force for entertainment and not just for contemplation. Both things can exist.","Without humor, I cannot go on and I doubt many of my readers would go on either. Humor is so important. I am here to have fun here with my work.","I always think that good writers should be growing up on the brink of death - it really lets them see mortality very clearly.","Silence has been destroyed, but also the idea that it's important to learn how another person thinks, to enter the mind of another person. The whole idea of empathy is gone. We are now part of this giant machine where every second we have to take out a device and contribute our thoughts and opinions.","American fiction is good. It would be nice if somebody read it.","I love things on the decline because that's really the natural progression of our lives. We're born, we're feisty for the first couple of years, and then the inevitable decline begins.","I took an acting class with Louise Lasser, Woody Allen's first wife and co-star in many movies. I've done some other indie films, if you look on the YouTube. I love acting - it's great.","I love Paul Giamatti - God, that man is like a walking Chekhov. His connection to humanity is unbelievable, and those feelings of low self-esteem - the way that all comes together on the screen? Delicious.","You want to read a book? That requires introspection. It requires time away from people and time away from the constant need to communicate and to connect.","A lot of the ways of advertising a book - the cover, whether somebody sees it on a subway or sees it in a bookstore - those things are going to rapidly diminish as we move to an electronic model.","I like the map feature on the iPhone that tells me where I am, because I travel a lot.","I read real books. On paper. You know, those printed books? I feel like this is the last thing I do to support my industry. I think they smell great, too.","In a strange way, I expected Russia to become more like America since the Soviet Union collapsed, but the reverse is true. America has become more like Russia: a kleptocratic society.","I have a love/hate relationship with just about everything, but certainly with America.","Good fiction makes me turn off all the other parts of my brain, so that I become quiet and submissive, entirely at the mercy of the work at hand."],"Gary Sinise":["I have a band that I started with a buddy of mine, a Vietnam veteran pal named Kimo Williams from Chicago.","I can honestly say that I've done everything I've wanted to do, always. Not without difficulty. But every time I wanted to do something, I just did it, from the age of 18 when I started my own theater with my friends. When I decided I wanted to act. I just bit the bullet.","You learn from things that don't go well, and you try to capitalize when they do. You build on those strengths and try to make your weaknesses stronger.","Careers, like rockets, don't always take off on time. The trick is to always keep the engine running.","I study to learn, to be an educated person.","My mission is to support our service members. They're volunteers, and if they're going to go to a hostile place like Afghanistan, I think we owe it to them to back them up and try to help them get through it.","It's always been my dream to do a dance scene with Anthony Hopkins.","I was always fascinated with rock 'n' roll, or girls, or something like that when I was a kid.","But I've got more to learn, too. I don't feel like I'm done or I know it all.","You've got to keep taking certain risks, because my priority is in acting, it's not in movie stardom.","Well, I've been to Iraq twice now. I was in Baghdad in June and then north of Baghdad in November.","I save money when I'm working so that I never have to take a role simply to pay the bills.","Sometimes you're in great demand. Then suddenly your career hits the breaks.","I'm not like one of those actors who's a frustrated director.","I've directed enough in the theatre and a couple of films to know that - to feel fairly secure that if I find a story that I really like I can probably get it done somewhat.","I've worked with a lot of really fine actors, both on stage and on screen. The level of their game lifts me up and brings the level of my game up to theirs. Always. It's like a constant upgrade.","Yeah, I volunteered to support the troops, and get out there and show them that we care about them.","I started a theater called Steppenwolf. We've been very supportive of the veterans there.","Wherever I go for the military, they always call me Lt. Dan. They just can't help it.","There's always the ongoing actor frustration of finding the great role to do next. I don't go to work a lot. I wait as long as I can until the money runs out or a great part comes along.","I have veterans in my family. But I didn't know anything about DAV, Disabled American Veterans.","I've never had to compromise myself for a job, ever.","The wonderful drama teacher at my high school, Barbara Patterson, saw me standing in the hall and told me I should audition for 'West Side Story.' I guess she thought I looked like a gang member.","Before discovering theater, I was sloughing off and didn't have any passion for school. Then I couldn't get enough. All of a sudden, I was getting good parts in all of these plays. I just loved it. I started getting A's in acting, directing and technical theater. I found something that clicked.","I do spend a lot of weekends on the road. I have to pace myself. It can be pretty busy, but I'm not out in the Afghan desert with 70 pounds on my back, away from my family for a year at a time. I keep a good perspective on it.","I think you're lucky if you discover what you really love at a young age. College wasn't something I was going to do. I wanted to keep acting, and I didn't want to go to New York or California and pound the pavement.","The University of Southern California has a wonderful social work department, and I was thrilled to find out that they have a whole veterans' initiative program there. They approached me, and I set up a scholarship that would go to a military-oriented person to learn techniques and skills to better help veterans.","My wife's a loving, funny, Irish-spirited person, and I'm still surprised at some of the things she says. She makes me laugh every day.","'The Stand' came out in May of '94 and was seen by 60 million people a night for four nights, and then two months later, 'Forrest Gump' opened. So within a very short time, I went from being depressed about not getting any work to being in two of the most popular shows of the year.","The chance to play a romantic character who kisses somebody onscreen was one of the elements that made me want to do 'The Stand.' The more you can do, the better, and I've been known as a character actor.","I started as an actor. I started directing because Steppenwolf needed another strong director.","I'm not registered to any party. I don't really play in the political world. I'm really more interested in getting things done.","I played a character in 'Ransom' who was as evil as they come.","I'm thrilled I can make a living doing something I enjoy.","Being able to act for a living is a blessing. I have a great theater company that's almost 40 years old.","I go into military communities and do fundraisers and that kind of thing with the band, because I know that the music can help do a lot of things. It can bring communities together, it can raise awareness... and it entertains.","If you're missing three or four limbs, you have special challenges going forward. And the last thing you want is to not be independent in your home.","Unless you have a long-running series, most actors just go job to job if you're lucky to keep working. You just do a movie or a play or a TV thing, and it's over at some point.","Have I done more business-related things to help my career grow? Yeah. I took the business end more seriously, hooked up with a manager, got some help, because at a certain point, you get frustrated when you go do auditions, and people say you did a great job, and then you don't get he part."],"Gary Snyder":["There are those who love to get dirty and fix things. They drink coffee at dawn, beer after work. And those who stay clean, just appreciate things. At breakfast they have milk and juice at night. There are those who do both, they drink tea.","Find your place on the planet. Dig in, and take responsibility from there."],"Gary Speed":["Everybody makes mistakes, but when goalkeepers make them, it is costly. That's the nature of being a goalkeeper.","If you've got aspirations to be a manager or coach, obviously coaching your country would be a great honour.","A lot of people still disregard something like yoga. I would have as a young player. I would have been too busy playing golf or something.","I think it's unfair to criticise someone for not being Welsh, but the smaller the nation, the more patriotic you seem to be.","I don't like the showy nationalism - a tattoo, wrapping yourself in a flag - that doesn't matter to me. The way to show your patriotism and commitment is to go and support or play for your team.","Everyone I know is fervently proud to be Welsh but you try not to be preachy about it. It's difficult at times. But when I go home to north Wales, or to somewhere I've never been in south Wales, I still feel at home because I'm in Wales. It's hard to explain.","You've got to believe you can get a result from the game.","I had a lot of times with Wales as well when we were getting beat - and beaten well - and you learn to deal with it. You learn that next time it happens, you roll your sleeves up and give everything for the team.","If I had my time again and was able to change one thing from my career then I wouldn't have retired. I would have played for Wales longer.","Goal scoring is a recurring theme. If you aren't scoring then you aren't going to win games. That's obvious.","I didn't want to leave Newcastle, but that's football.","Everyone tells me to play as long as you can. Sometimes, it goes in one ear and out the other.","What's important is Welsh football and that it progresses.","I have won 85 caps and have had a great career with Wales and have enjoyed every minute of it.","I love everything about playing for Newcastle, the club, the fans and the city."],"Gary Valentine":["The key in controlling my asthma is pretty simple: I have a good professional diagnosis, and I follow my doctor's instructions closely. You need to acknowledge both.","My dad passed on asthma to me. It's kind of ironic because he outgrew it at 13.","Asthma doesn't affect me, even though I have it. It can seem like it wants to act up a little if I'm nervous before going on stage, but that's natural to many performers. If I think it's going to be a problem, I just reach for my inhaler.","The reasons asthma doesn't affect my work or play is that I had accurate diagnostics and follow treatment regimens closely. It's when someone thinks they're fine and that they don't need help that they usually get in trouble."],"Gary Vaynerchuk":["The reason we love our parents is because they loved us first. Every single company should take this advice.","Social media requires that business leaders start thinking like small-town shop owners. This means taking the long view and avoiding short-term benchmarks to gauge progress. It means allowing the personality, heart and soul of the people who run all levels of the business to show.","Anyone working for a big company might be skeptical that a large business, or even a strictly online business, can form the same kind of friendly, loyal relationship with customers as a local retailer. I'm saying it's already been done because I lived it.","I attract a crowd, not because I'm an extrovert or I'm over the top or I'm oozing with charisma. It's because I care.","Brands mature over time, like a marriage. The bond you feel with your spouse is different than when you first met each other. Excitement and discovery are replaced by comfort and depth.","The chef that grew up with the grandma who cooks tends to always beat the chef that went to the culinary institute. It's in the blood.","People are chasing cash, not happiness. When you chase money, you're going to lose. You're just going to. Even if you get the money, you're not going to be happy.","I influence anybody who is able to get through the chaos of my first impression.","When the tech geeks talk, I pay close attention.","I am wired like a CEO and care a great deal about the bottom line, but I care about my customers even more than that. That's always been my competitive advantage.","People don't want to embrace culture shifts because it's not going to happen in the next 20 minutes.","Eighty-five per cent of the crowd is going to fall in love with me - they're going to feel it, wow. But fifteen per cent are going to think, 'This guy is obnoxious.' I spend enormous time with them - every negative review of 'Crush It!' on Amazon has a response from me - and I can probably bring back ten of the fifteen.","If I could drink only one wine, it would be Champagne.","My dad is like a cactus - introverted and tough. I'm a people person, like my mom, but I got my competitiveness from my dad. He came to this country from Belarus with nothing and built a real business. He's my hero for giving me that need to run a business and for having enormous confidence in me.","You have to understand your own personal DNA. Don't do things because I do them or Steve Jobs or Mark Cuban tried it. You need to know your personal brand and stay true to it.","I love people, and the hustle.","I think the acquisition of consumers might be on the verge of being mapped. The battlefield is going to be retention and lifetime value.","Storytelling is the game. It's what we all do. It's why Nike is Nike, it's why Apple is Apple, it's why Walt Disney built Disney World and it's why Vince McMahon makes a billion dollars.","When I hear people debate the ROI of social media? It makes me remember why so many business fail. Most businesses are not playing the marathon. They're playing the sprint. They're not worried about lifetime value and retention. They're worried about short-term goals.","Think of social media as the Internet. I can't think of anyone betting against the Internet in 2012.","I always say that the real success of Wine Library wasn't due to the videos I posted, but to the hours I spent talking to people online afterward, making connections and building relationships.","I want to sit with 80- and 90-year-old people more than anyone. They have played this game before. Not one of them has told me, 'I wish I had more money.'","Stop doing things that waste time. Don't replace time with your family or things that you need to do. I needed to put together two fantasy teams this weekend because that's something I enjoy, but I did stop playing Nintendo Wii for hours on end.","I am thinking about launching a wine website where there is a deal and the crowd can dictate how cheap it can get.","I have no interest in going to Egypt and seeing the pyramids. I'm just not that kind of dude.","You have to respect your parents. They are giving you an at-bat. If you're an entrepreneur and go into the family business, you want to grow fast. Patience is important. But respect the other party... My dad and I pulled it off because we really respect each other.","One of the things that I'm really proud of is that I have really good timing. It's very easy for me to see what's coming up and it's no coincidence that I went headfirst into wine and then headfirst into new media - none at all.","Be reactionary. React to what the market wants. And the market wants one-on-one real time engagement. Now that we have the tools to engage, I'm going to continue fighting for the end user.","Beaujolais is so underrated.","I think what's happening for me, it's fun to see other things besides Facebook and Twitter take hold. The maturity of Tumblr as a real player is exciting. I think Pinterest has proved to be a major player. It's fun to see Instagram become a major player. It's fun to watch things like SnapChat, and Vine, try to vie to be the next thing.","Here's how I work: It's 2013, and most marketers are operating like it's 2009. I'm always trying to market like it's 2015, but not like it's 2020. A lot of my contemporaries who understand where the world is going, go too far out, and aren't practical. I have always prided myself on being visionary, with a heavy practicality.","I'm an entrepreneur first and a wine critic second.","People who build family businesses are not classically trained. They have to deal with an enormous amount of politics. You think corporate politics are tough? Go work for your dad or your mom.","One of my biggest flaws is I don't take advice.","I am surprised by how not-adopted the video reply has been. What keeps other people from doing it, I think, is that they think a video comes across as 'I'm cool, look at how many e-mails I get.' That perception doesn't scare me, because I know who I am.","Too many companies think they want to do a video blog to sell merchandise, but if you turn your site into QVC, you lose. I have an audience that trusts me. It's about building a global brand - not selling four more bottles of Pinot Grigio.","Even though I'm a hype man myself, I like the practicality of it all. People who understand how to turn a profit. At the end of the day, this is still business so I'm looking for real practical knowledge of how to actually make money, not necessarily raise it.","We're living in what I like to call the 'Thank You Economy,' because only the companies that can figure out how to mind their manners in a very old-fashioned way - and do it authentically - are going to have a prayer of competing.","I want people to know their palate is a snowflake. We all like different things. Why should we all have the same taste in wines?","Really, truly, try to figure out what your palate is all about. If you've determined that you don't like dirty old stinky wine - old-world flavors - you probably like new-world fruit bombs. Stick to Shirazes and California Cabernets or Zinfandels.","Best wine if you're stranded on a deserted island? 1982 Salon Champagne.","I find it fascinating that a lot of business books that do well are from people who've never made any money in business.","The thing that I'm most passionate about, I'm writing a book called 'Jab Jab Jab Jab Jab Right Hook,' and it really focuses on how to story-tell in a noisy, ADD world.","The world has changed - through technology, through wine-making techniques, the quality of wine is greater than it's ever been. Whereas ten, fifteen years ago it was very easy to find lots of bad wine, it's kind of hard now. The technology, the science - it's like, are you kidding? We're in the golden years of wine!","I would argue heavily that the time that has been allocated to social used to come from television, and people are benefitting from it. People who are saying, 'Aw, you're spending all your time on Facebook, or all your time on Twitter,' I'd like to understand what the person used to do with that time.","A broad trend I'm completely obsessed with is mobile commerce. Like completely. I'm completely convinced that everybody's going to be buying from their mobile devices. Whoever can claim that space or be in that space, I'm very interested in.","I don't know how you can justify leaving any engagement behind in the social Web of 2011.","The reason I was able to grow my business was that every day, after producing 30 minutes of wine television, I spent 15 hours a day replying to every single person's e-mail and every single person's Twitter @ reply.","I don't want anybody to not recognize how appreciative I am of the volume of e-mails I get.","Nobody walks this earth thinking he's better than I think I am - I think I'm great. At the same time, it's so obvious to me that I'm nobody.","99.5 percent of the people that walk around and say they are a social media expert or guru are clowns. We are going to live through a devastating social media bubble.","From age 16, I lived and breathed wine. I read every magazine and book about wine.","I hate recording all the shows for the week in one day, because I want to be able to mention current events and pop culture. If Madonna punches Britney in the face today, I want to reference that on 'Wine Library TV' tomorrow. Monday's episode is always the best, because it's hot off the press.","I'm a storyteller. I love to tell stories about brands. I love to tell stories, period. I like painting pictures through the words, and that's what I do.","I'm concerned a little bit with the culture of celebrating the fundraise. My dad taught me that when you borrow money it's the worst day of your life.","Vince McMahon is one of the greatest storytellers of all time, but WWE's not striving for the kind of innovation it's capable of.","I went online with winelibrary.com in July of 1997; that was my first professional online play.","I definitely think there's some way to understand how people emotionally feel about somebody, but I don't think data collects it. They're not going to click your bit.ly link or click your TweetMeme retweet every time.","I'm a big fan of Mashable and TechCrunch and other outlets like that, but TechMeme obviously does an amazing job of aggregating.","My store, Wine Library, outsells big national chains. How do you think we do it? It started with hustle. I always say that our success wasn't due to my hundreds of online videos about wine that went viral, but to the hours I spent talking to people online afterward, making connections and building relationships.","You cannot underestimate people's ability to spot a soulless, bureaucratic tactic a million miles away. It's a big reason why so many companies that have dipped a toe in social media waters have failed miserably.","Winelibrary.tv was about building personal brand equity. It was a business move. Now, it was totally surrounded by a passion for wine, but I very much gave a lot of thought to doing a sports-video blog instead.","When I was 17 or 18 I wanted to become a wine expert, and my parents wouldn't let me drink. So I was devastated. All I could do was read, and I read and I read. And I'd read something like, you know, 'Subtle hints of cassis.'","People are more comfortable learning about wine because now they can just Google, you know, 'Soave,' and say, 'Oh, O.K., cool.'","When we launched the WineLibrary website in 1996, I didn't even own a computer yet. I just understood that there was an opportunity here to market in a different way.","2006, I started 'WineLibrary TV.' To build 'WineLibrary TV,' I started using Facebook, Tumblr, and Twitter in 2008.","The first thing I ever invested in was Twitter. Blaine Cook, former CTO, was leaving the company and asked me if I wanted to buy his stock.","Many people who I respected were disappointed when I started 'Wine Library TV.' They thought I was dumbing down wine, but I always knew I was one of the biggest producers of new wine drinkers in the world, and people are realizing it now.","My natural inclination to be improv rather than an educated character serves me well.","It's about stories. If I can tell the story to America, whether it's Riesling or a boxer from Harlem, it will sell. I know on my gravestone it's going to be, 'Storyteller.'","I know if I stopped hosting 'Wine Library TV,' we'd probably lose 75 percent of our audience, but the remaining 25 percent is still a big number.","Do you know how many companies have wanted me to do an energy drink for them because I named my book 'Crush It!'? It might be fun one day, but right now I think it would undermine the personal brand I've built.","I want to own the New York Jets, that's what I want. And I absolutely believe I am going to own the Jets.","I have Internet fame. Real fame is more intense.","The Loire Valley is grossly underestimated. The prices are fair, and the wines are real.","As much as I love crisp, clean whites, there's always a time for rich but balanced Chardonnays with oak, especially at Thanksgiving.","It's insane to me to ask anybody to be what they're not. Know what you know the best, love the most. That's always going to be the answer to the thing that you have the best shot at winning at.","If you talk about Cabernet and Merlot-based value between $10 and $25, I will tell you that Bordeaux is the best value in the world.","Bordeaux would be naive not to recognize that Robert Parker was driving the brand equity. If the next generation doesn't care about Chateau Pichon-Lalande, then you have a problem.","I'm not afraid to call a wine that tastes like Skittles or green peppers mixed with orange marmalade. I'll say, 'It tastes like chicken.' I mean, that's not what people think of when they think of wine, but that's what it tastes like to me and it hits home.","Okay, let's talk about cartoon labels for half a second - some people think anything with a dog or a car or a colorful alien is garbage, which is not true. Look at Big Moose Red. It's, like, a $6 wine with a cheesy label, and it's actually a solid wine.","I know I could be the host of 'SportsCenter' in two years if I changed my show today to sports.","There's always a wine bully. The one person who did read the 'Wine Spectator,' who tells you what to drink and why the '97 is better than the '98. I want to punch the wine bully in the face. I want to make sure this generation of wine drinkers isn't elitist and snotty. I want it to be about family and bringing people together.","IQ is a commodity, data is a commodity. I'm far more interested in watching people interact at a restaurant with their smartphone. We can all read 'Tech Crunch,' 'Ad Age.' I would rather be living in the trenches. I would rather be going to Whole Foods in Columbus Circle to watch people shop with their smartphones.","VaynerMedia filters the world how humans interact. This is how people are going to make buying decisions.","Word of mouth works now, much more than ever. @-reply every single person.","I'm pretty good at sticking to what I know. You don't see me social commentating on health-care or presidential debates. I talk about what I know because I'm petrified of being wrong.","I really chess-play culture shifts. I'm really good at understanding what worldwide cell-phone use means. That's what I do. I try to picture it three to four to five steps ahead.","If there's a problem, we at Wine Library never tell ourselves that once we handle this issue, we'll never have to deal with the person again. We talk to every single person as though we're going to wind up sitting next to that person at his or her mother's house that night for dinner.","I do not believe that people want to work hard enough and they want to find the quick Twitter, SEO. Anybody who's obsessed with SEO has lost already, period. I believe that firmly."],"Gary Webb":["After spending three years of my life looking into this, I am more convinced than ever that the U.S. government's responsibility for the drug problems in South Central Los Angeles and other inner cities is greater than I ever wrote in the newspaper.","You can't believe the government - on anything. And you especially can't believe them when they're talking about important stuff."],"Gary Weiss":["The heart of the 2008 financial crisis was a coterie of reckless financial executives, working for too-big-to-fail financial companies, who were handsomely compensated for taking risks that almost ruined the economy when they failed.","One problem with the focus on speculation is that it tends to promote the growth of the great intellectual cancer of our times: conspiracy theories.","When it comes to making laws that protect the public from the financial services industry, Congress has done a progressively worse job since the Pecora Commission hearings of the early 1930s, which led to Congress taking bold steps to regulate banking and securities firms in 1933 and 1934.","Kochi, formerly called Cochin, is a former European settlement with a large Christian population and a seafaring heritage. It is a town of enormous charm that reminds some visitors of the Caribbean more than India.","Humiliating events have a way of capturing the public's imagination. So it has been since antiquity, when gladiators were pitted against each other and the legions of Spartacus were crucified in endless rows on the way to Rome.","Excessive hype, bankruptcy, cash burning like autumn leaves - such is the stuff of short-selling.","Some hedge fund managers have made big bucks trading oil futures - George Soros is one.","The problem with the focus on speculators, as was demonstrated during the financial crisis, is that it tends to divert attention from the real villains. During the financial crisis, the villains were the actions of the banks, not the speculators betting on bank share prices.","Oil futures were originally created to give heating oil dealers, gas retailers, aviation companies and other businesses a method of hedging against adverse price changes. Instead, they've become just another Wall Street plaything.","The flip side of humiliation is pride.","If you think Wall Street has a short memory, you're dead wrong. No, the folks who work on Wall Street, regulate Wall Street - and, above all, invest in its wares, notably its hedge funds - don't have a bad memory. They don't have any memory at all.","MF Global used to be known as Man Financial, and it had a reasonably good reputation. It did a humdrum business placing commodities trades for fund managers as well as farmers, grain dealers and others whose livelihoods depend on the vagaries of commodity prices.","With such enormous bucks devoted to trading in oil and other commodities, the distortions that they cause have been exacerbated.","No other facet of American business is more corrupt, more intoxicated with illegality, more weakly regulated, and has a greater impact on poor and working people than debt collectors; not credit card companies or subprime mortgages, not even payday lenders.","Beefs against debt collectors are consistently among the top complaints received by both the FTC and state attorneys general.","People are told their rights when they're arrested. Consumers getting collection letters are entitled to the same courtesy.","Debt collectors should be required to disclose the applicable statute of limitations in the body of their collection letters, in bold type. While it's not illegal to dun a consumer for an old debt, it is illegal to sue for one.","Newt Gingrich is a boastful kind of guy. But when it comes to Wall Street, the former House speaker is surprisingly modest.","Insider trading by hedge funds has a long and distinguished history, dating to the days when people didn't know that there was such a thing as a hedge fund.","I'm not an ultra-libertarian who thinks there shouldn't be insider-trading laws at all.","Ordinarily, the feds piggyback on the S.E.C. in complicated financial cases, but history proves that breath-holding on that score is a dangerous endeavor.","I've met Dick Syron. I like the guy. He's a man's man kind of character, a real charmer, the kind of guy you'd want to have a beer with, as well as being an economist of considerable repute.","I found that options traders - the Amex was mainly an options exchange - routinely conspired to keep as wide as possible the spreads between the prices investors paid and the prices floor traders paid for the same securities.","For Randy Neugebauer, the Texas Republican who chairs the investigations subcommittee, the top sources of funding for his 2012 reelection campaign are from the insurance, banking, finance, securities and real estate industries.","Conspiracy theories feed on opacity, and that's a longtime problem with short selling. Large long positions must be reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission in public filings, but not large short positions.","Short-sellers perform a useful function in the market as conduits of negative information, and shorts often complain that they are discriminated against by regulators.","I'm rooting for Saudi Arabia getting a seat on the U.N. Human Rights Council.","Mutual funds dare to be average. In fact, they dare to be lousy. They have long since ceased striving for anything resembling perfection when it comes to managing your money.","There are a lot worse things you can do with all your bucks than giving them to even a mediocre mutual fund - such as, for example, giving them to a mediocre hedge fund. If supporting the lifestyle of a mediocre fund manager is your favorite charity, who am I to stop you?","In the U.S., diversity is a politically correct slogan. In India, it is a historical fact. Much as we in the West may resent it, India has a lot to teach us when it comes to religious tolerance.","India may be the only country in the world that has been free of anti-Semitic prejudice throughout its history.","Indians are sometimes accused of being condescending toward Westerners and of being excessively preachy in their attitude toward other nations. That accusation is sometimes correct.","Legitimate institutions historically have been defenseless in the face of outright fraud.","When Corporate America finds a Jayson Blair in its midst, the standard operating procedure is to circle the wagons and deny that any form of liability extends up the chain of command.","George Soros is one of the few characters from the world of finance who deserves to be called larger-than-life.","When the Securities & Exchange Commission settled securities-fraud charges against Richard Harriton, former chairman of the clearing subsidiary of Bear, Stearns & Co., there were smiles all around. The SEC was happy. Harriton was happy. Bear Stearns was happy.","In the struggle against sexual discrimination on Wall Street, Pamela K. Martens is a latter-day Rosa Parks - a woman who, metaphorically speaking, refused to sit in the back of the bus.","For the Amex, which has been casting around for a role for itself, microcaps fill a crucial void - a 'niche' that Amex officials feel has been neglected.","Even a casual reader of the financial pages knows that microcaps are a perennial headache for regulators and, above all, for investors because they have been prone to abuse by stock manipulators.","The Amex has a long, often troubled, sometimes glorious history.","Shorts wager on price declines by selling shares that they have borrowed in the hope of buying them back at far lower prices.","With 'posts' running in the millions, Internet message boards have become an essential part of the savvy investor's arsenal.","At their worst, message boards can subject you to mindless braying or outright stock scams. But at their best, they provide meaty insights on just about every stock imaginable.","Despite all the drawbacks, the Internet provides a wide array of information - and some of it is being watched pretty carefully by the pros.","The media and marketing deluge has spawned a new type of Wall Street loser: the armchair momentum player. These are novice investors who engage in short-term stock buying and selling based on media reports or an expert's enthusiasm.","Broadcasts from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange have propelled once-obscure financial journalists such as Maria Bartiromo to celebrity status and made CNBC to investors what ESPN is to sports fans.","All too often, the pitchmen are selling the notion that if you gain 'control' over your financial destiny - pick your own stocks and execute your own trades - it will be the first step on a short road to riches.","Numerous academic studies have shown that amateur investors make poor traders - buying stocks for the wrong reasons, holding losers for too long, and acting on whims and emotions."],"Gary William Flake":["I knew, always, what I wanted to be. Even before I had my first computer, I wanted to be a computer scientist.","I like change, and I like being in the middle of change."],"Gary Wolf":["During a large disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, warnings get hopelessly jumbled. The truth is that, for warnings to work, it's not enough for them to be delivered. They must also overcome that human tendency to pause; they must trigger a series of effective actions, mobilizing the informal networks that we depend on in a crisis.","People are saying, 'Big Data is the new oil.'","Our experience in fooling around with the genes of mice has taught us that many of the traits that interest us are not definite products of specific mutations but emergent phenomena arising from extremely complex interactions between genes, environment, and life experience.","SuperMemo is based on the insight that there is an ideal moment to practice what you've learned. Practice too soon and you waste your time. Practice too late and you've forgotten the material and have to relearn it. The right time to practice is just at the moment you're about to forget.","Fortunately, human forgetting follows a pattern. We forget exponentially. A graph of our likelihood of getting the correct answer on a quiz sweeps quickly downward over time and then levels off.","Steve Jobs has been right twice. The first time we got Apple. The second time we got NeXT. The Macintosh ruled. NeXT tanked. Still, Jobs was right both times.","To the small group of editors and designers who would launch Wired in January 1993, technology represented the future's best hope; but to the media, the tech boom was yesterday's story.","The intersection of political analysis and Internet theory is a busy crossroad of cliche, where familiar rhetorical vehicles - decentralized authority, emergent leadership, empowered grass roots - create a ceaseless buzz.","The problem of forgetting might not torment us so much if we could only convince ourselves that remembering isn't important. Perhaps the things we learn - words, dates, formulas, historical and biographical details - don't really matter. Facts can be looked up. That's what the Internet is for.","As a science fiction fan, I had always assumed that when computers supplemented our intelligence, it would be because we outsourced some of our memory to them. We would ask questions, and our machines would give oracular - or supremely practical - replies.","The Internet's great promise is to make the world's information universally accessible and useful.","Craigslist is not only gigantic in scale and totally resistant to business cooperation, it is also mostly free.","Sometimes entire categories of craigslist are rendered nearly unusable by spam. Con artists prowl the listings, paying sellers with fake cashier's checks and luring buyers to share their credit card numbers.","Every day the choristers of the social web chirp their advice about openness and trust; craigslist follows none of it, and every day it grows.","The history of using mice to stand in for humans in medical experiments is replete with failures.","Though social eugenics was discredited long ago, we still often think of the genome in quasi-eugenic terms. When we read about the latest discovery of a link between a gene and a disease, we imagine that we've learned the cause of the disease, and we may even think we'll get a cure by fixing the gene.","The fondest dream of the information age is to create an archive of all knowledge. You might call it the Alexandrian fantasy, after the great library founded by Ptolemy I in 286 BC.","Books are an ancient and proven medium. Their physical form inspires passion.","Even as the Internet has revived hope of a universal library and Google seems to promise an answer to every query, books have remained a dark region in the universe of information. We want books to be as accessible and searchable as the Web. On the other hand, we still want them to be books.","Human attention is limited, and a massive number of newly browsable books from the long tail necessarily compete with the biggest best-sellers, just as cable siphons audience from the major networks, and just as the Web pulls viewers from TV.","Being a 911 operator means balancing seemingly contradictory skills. On one hand, operators have to be fanatically precise and well-organized. On the other, they must be able to establish rapport with panicky callers.","If national safety - the ability to respond to hurricanes, terrorist attacks, earthquakes - depends on the execution of explicit plans, on soldierly obedience, and on showy security drills, then a decentralized security scheme is useless.","Humans make errors. We make errors of fact and errors of judgment. We have blind spots in our field of vision and gaps in our stream of attention. Sometimes we can't even answer the simplest questions.","For all their expertise at figuring out how things work, technical people are often painfully aware how much of human behavior is a mystery. People do things for unfathomable reasons. They are opaque even to themselves.","Millions of us track ourselves all the time. We step on a scale and record our weight. We balance a checkbook. We count calories. But when the familiar pen-and-paper methods of self-analysis are enhanced by sensors that monitor our behavior automatically, the process of self-tracking becomes both more alluring and more meaningful.","The idea that our mental life is affected by hidden causes is a mainstay of psychology.","The self is just our operation center, our consciousness, our moral compass. So, if we want to act more effectively in the world, we have to get to know ourselves better."],"Gary Wright":["Unfortunately, music devolved instead of evolved. The music business got into the hands of lawyers and accountants rather than the entrepreneurial creative people, and that's when the beginning of the end started. It's all based on money instead of art and creativity.","Music is an extremely powerful force if used properly to uplift people. I believe music should be uplifting and not downgrading... it's a very, very powerful tool.","The Internet is both great and terrible. As a source of information, a tool for delivering music and art, it's great. But spamming ads and piracy of music is terrible. It's stealing.","We visited Ravi. We didn't study with him, as such.","We lived on a farm in the English countryside, where we wrote a lot of our music. You really were treated like an artist during those days-not like product, which is now the mode.","The more far-out artists, the better.","The idea to do the album only on keyboards kind of happened by accident. I was quite happy with the sound and felt it really didn't need more instruments, so I didn't use them.","No one likes to work for free. To copy an artist's work and download it free is stealing. It's hard work writing and recording music, and it's morally wrong to steal it.","My music and lyrics became an extension of this Indian philosophy.","Music's staying power is a function of how timeless the lyrics, song and production are.","India profoundly changed my outlook on life because you see how people can be content and very happy with little or even no possessions. It's the reverse of the West.","In 1972, George Harrison invited me to accompany him on a trip to India.","I'm developing artists for my new record label, my son's band, Intangible, being one of them.","I will be developing artists for my new label. The rest is in God's Hands.","I like Anastacia's version of Love is Alive best.","I didn't develop or build synths. I had my technicians modify them for my live stage performances.","I always wanted to do something completely different.","George Harrison is perhaps one of the most creative people I ever met, not only in his music and songwriting, but just the way he lived his life, decorated his gardens and homes. He was a dear friend of mine. His entire approach to music was very unique.","Artists were nurtured back in the '70s. Their music was developed by the record companies.","As a kid, I used to love to play baseball and be in Little League and sleep outside with my friends and do all those kind of things.","I was the first artist, I think, to ever do an all-keyboard album. There were things that resembled it, like Stevie Wonder. A lot of his stuff was on keyboards, but he used brass and he used other things as well. I was the first artist, also, to use drum machines. I was really the one who kind of started that whole thing.","My voice hasn't changed really very much. I still do all my songs when I perform live and still do them in the original keys. I've been blessed with that ability to retain that.","By the law of averages, there has to be life elsewhere. The universe is so huge, and I don't think God would have created this whole big huge cosmos and just say there's only going to be life on Earth, and that's it.","I went to Berlin to study psychology but decided that I was more interested in music and started an R and B band.","I had no idea 'The Dream Weaver' would be so successful. Everything just fell into place with that album. I pioneered a number of ideas with that album and subsequent tour. The all-keyboard approach with no guitars was a new one, and I was one of the first to use a drum machine in concert. It was an amazing time.","Sometimes when you make a record and it's not successful, you just don't want to go through that process for a while. You want to have your wounds heal.","I scored a movie called 'Endangered Species'. I worked on another movie called 'Staying Alive'. A German film called 'Fire and Ice'.","I had toured so much in the 1960s and 1970s that I wanted a break. I didn't go back touring until 1995.","It's kind of weird. You can have hits, but it's hard to sustain a career. I went through that period where I didn't have a lot of hits, although people were still buying the records.","My goal is really to continue to make music. I really don't make music to have platinum records and all that kind of stuff. I've been there. I do it because I love music, and I love uplifting people through my music. That's my real goal."],"Gary Zukav":["We cannot stop the winter or the summer from coming. We cannot stop the spring or the fall or make them other than they are. They are gifts from the universe that we cannot refuse. But we can choose what we will contribute to life when each arrives.","We are becoming able to see the pursuit of external power for what it is and the futility of trying to escape the pain of powerlessness by changing the world. When we look inward, not outward, we can dismantle the parts of our personalities that have controlled us for so long - such as anger, jealousy, vindictiveness, superiority, inferiority.","The winter solstice has always been special to me as a barren darkness that gives birth to a verdant future beyond imagination, a time of pain and withdrawal that produces something joyfully inconceivable, like a monarch butterfly masterfully extracting itself from the confines of its cocoon, bursting forth into unexpected glory.","A spiritual partnership is a partnership between equals for the purpose of spiritual growth. Spiritual partners use their delightful experiences together as well as their power struggles to learn about themselves and change themselves.","No one can occupy your generosity except you. Who can occupy your patience when impatience roars through you? Who except you can choose not to act with judgment when all of your thoughts are judgmental? Your life is yours to live, no matter how you choose to live it. When you do not think about how you intend to live it, it lives you.","Unworthiness is the inmost frightening thought that you do not belong, no matter how much you want to belong, that you are an outsider and will always be an outsider. It is the idea that you are flawed and cannot be fixed. It is wanting to be loved and feeling unlovable, or wanting to love and feeling that you are not capable of loving.","The spring wakes us, nurtures us and revitalizes us. How often does your spring come? If you are a prisoner of the calendar, it comes once a year. If you are creating authentic power, it comes frequently, or very frequently.","Authentic power is the real deal. You can't inherit it, buy it, or win it. You also can't lose it. You don't need to build your body, reputation, wealth, or charisma to get it.","The first step is to distinguish the loving parts of your personality that are active from the frightened parts of your personality that are active - in other words, to learn to distinguish love from fear in you. The second step is to choose love, no matter what.","The next time you feel unworthy, inadequate or inferior, remember that these experiences have nothing to do with humbleness, any more than lowering yourself to connect with another individual has to do with humbleness. There are no lower or higher individuals in the perception of a humble person. There are only souls. There is only love.","The essence of a person is not the clothing she wears or the things he does. People who love them do not stop loving them when they change clothing or do other things. Your essence is not even your history, culture, race, or what you think and do. It is your soul.","At the Summer Solstice, all is green and growing, potential coming into being, the miracle of manifestation painted large on the canvas of awareness. At the Winter Solstice, the wind is cold, trees are bare and all lies in stillness beneath blankets of snow.","We are evolving as one species - not only as Americans, Syrians, Russians, Chinese, and jihadists. We cannot attack one without inflicting forms of violence and destruction upon ourselves. This is our new reality.","This is how to avoid re-creating painful situations: Take the time to discover your real intention before you act. If it is to change someone or the world so that you will feel safe or better about yourself, don't act on it, because it is an intention of fear and can create only painful consequences.","When someone fears losing your affection, he or she will strive to keep it. Perhaps you have strived to keep someone's affection, too. Fear of loss is not love.","Compassion is loving others enough to say or do what is appropriate from an empowered heart without attachment to the outcome.","The coming and going of the seasons give us more than the springtimes, summers, autumns, and winters of our lives. It reflects the coming and going of the circumstances of our lives like the glassy surface of a pond that shows our faces radiant with joy or contorted with pain.","The one characteristic of authentic power that most people overlook is humbleness. It is important for many reasons. A humble person walks in a friendly world. He or she sees friends everywhere he or she looks, wherever he or she goes, whomever he or she meets. His or her perception goes beyond the shell of appearance and into essence.","The more aware of your intentions and your experiences you become, the more you will be able to connect the two, and the more you will be able to create the experiences of your life consciously. This is the development of mastery. It is the creation of authentic power.","The requirements for our evolution have changed. Survival is no longer sufficient. Our evolution now requires us to develop spiritually - to become emotionally aware and make responsible choices. It requires us to align ourselves with the values of the soul - harmony, cooperation, sharing, and reverence for life.","Some people feel good about helping others, and they do so often. They do not realize that their good deeds have a second agenda. They want to be appreciated.","Love grounds you. It orients you. Love brings your awareness to others and yourself. Love opens your mind and heart to others and yourself. Love settles you and gives you balance.","The characteristics of an authentically empowered personality are humbleness, clarity, forgiveness and love.","Everyone wants to learn the same thing from painful situations: how to avoid repeating them.","Each time you choose not to act on a frightened part of your personality, you create authentic power - and you grow spiritually. The frightened parts of your personality come less frequently and with less intensity, and the loving parts fill more and more of your consciousness.","Caregivers attract caregivers and live in a community of love. They are energized by their caring, fulfilled, and they love life. Caretakers attract caretakers and live in the company of resentful victims who see themselves as misused and are fatigued from constant giving with no return.","Each solstice is a domain of experience unto itself. At the Summer Solstice, all is green and growing, potential coming into being, the miracle of manifestation painted large on the canvas of awareness. At the Winter Solstice, the wind is cold, trees are bare and all lies in stillness beneath blankets of snow.","Caregiving has no second agendas or hidden motives. The care is given from love for the joy of giving without expectation, no strings attached.","The only things standing between you and the compassionate, wise, and creative person you want to be are matters of choice. Your choice. No one can occupy your generosity except you.","There is no other way to change something or someone for the better except to occupy it first. The only person you can occupy is yourself. That is why the only person who can change you for the better is you. Without your decision to change and your commitment to change, you will not change.","You experience your soul each time you sense yourself as more than a mind and body, your life as meaningful, or you feel that you have gifts to give and you long to give them.","Developing compassion for Congress and politicians is a good way to begin practicing the new social activism if you want to make effective changes in the world. Perhaps the most startling new insight of all is that there is no other way to effectively change the world.","The hardest times to choose love are the very times when you can most grow spiritually. In fact, they are the only times you can grow spiritually!","The choice that frees or imprisons us is the choice of love or fear. Love liberates. Fear imprisons.","Caregiving requires the intention of love, caretaking requires the intention of fear. Not acting in anger when you are angry requires the intention of love.","Both the Winter and the Summer Solstices are expressions of love. They show us the opposition of light and dark, expansion and contraction, that characterize our experiences in the Earth school so that we can recognize our options as we move through our lives.","Painful emotions show you what prevents you from creating harmony, cooperation, sharing and reverence for life.","Religions cannot change you. If you are angry, you will become an angry Muslim or Hindu. If you are righteous, you will become a righteous Christian or Jew.","The loving parts of your personality have no trouble loving. That is all they do. You experience the loving parts of as gratitude, appreciation, caring, patience, contentment and awe of life.","The pain of powerlessness is excruciating. It is the most painful experience in the earth school, and everyone shares it.","Anything that we do to make ourselves feel worthy and safe is a flight from the pain of powerlessness. Every pursuit of external power - every attempt to change the world or a person in order to make yourself feel valuable and safe - is a distraction from the pain of powerlessness.","A responsible choice is a choice that creates consequences that you are willing to assume responsibility for.","When you know your intention, you are in a position to choose the consequences that you will create for yourself. When you choose an intention that creates consequences for which you are willing to be responsible, that is a responsible choice.","We cannot control what emotions or circumstances we will experience next, but we can choose how we will respond to them.","The only way to become authentically powerful is to create authentic power. You cannot wish, want, or command authentic power into your life, although you can try.","A spiritual partnership is between people who promise themselves to use all of their experiences to grow spiritually. They use their emotions to show them how to create constructive and healthy and joyful consequences instead of destructive and unhealthy and painful consequences.","Your life is yours to live, no matter how you choose to live it. When you do not think about how you intend to live it, it lives you. When you occupy it, step into it consciously, you live it.","Your intentions are your nonphysical causes that set energy into motion. They create a multitude of effects and, therefore, determine the experiences of your life. This is one of the most important things that you can know. It is also something that you can see for yourself is true.","The nonphysical law allows you to use nonphysical causes to create nonphysical effects and also physical effects. This does not mean that you are not in control of what you create. On the contrary! It means that you are entirely free to create what you want, provided you are aware of how the nonphysical law of cause and effect works.","A new understanding of power is replacing our old understanding of power as the ability to manipulate and control. The old understanding of power has become counterproductive to our evolution. What used to be good medicine has become poisonous. Pursuit of the ability to manipulate and control now produces only violence and destruction.","The more you create authentic power, the more the characteristics of authentic power become yours, and the more meaning, purpose and joy enter your life.","Caretaking is different from care giving. Care giving has no second agendas or hidden motives. The care is given from love for the joy of giving without expectation, no strings attached. It cannot be manipulated or discouraged because love cannot be manipulated or discouraged.","Our experiences of the Solstice depends entirely upon where we are when it occurs. Neither Solstice encompasses everyone. Neither can. The Solstices stand forever opposed, literally at the two poles of our Earth and experiences.","When two people in an intimate-couple relationship look at their interactions as opportunities to learn about themselves instead of change each other, they are infusing their relationship with the energy of spiritual partnership.","Commitment and creativity cannot be captured and handcuffed. Inspiration cannot be jailed. The heart cannot be contained.","Only choices made in love are compassionate. There are no exceptions. Do you have the courage to act with an empowered heart without attachment to the outcome? If not, you have no ability to give or experience compassion. That is the shocking truth."],"Gaspard Ulliel":["When I'm doing a photo shoot, I'm not playing a part. I'm just trying to be myself.","Since first starting my career, I've grown accustomed to working with actors older than me. I'm always the youngest.","When you're so passionate about cinema, the idea to direct your own film is really appealing.","The Chanel woman is slender, sophisticated and chic.","I just choose the scripts I want to work on. I don't know why. It's not something conscious or that I'm doing on purpose.","I did some theater as a kid for fun. But it was really by chance that I landed into acting.","I've been an amateur photographer since my teens.","I love music.","My secret dream has always been to be a jazz musician. I tried the saxophone for a year or two when I was younger, but unfortunately I had to face the fact that I was not really talented!","I love good food. I'm an epicurean, that's for sure... But I am not really a good cook.","Well, I think it can be quite helpful to be working on a character who actually existed, historically. Of course, you might have material to study and help you create the character.","When you see period films, it tends to often be with older actors.","I'm not really a model."],"Gaston Bachelard":["To live life well is to express life poorly; if one expresses life too well, one is living it no longer.","One must always maintain one's connection to the past and yet ceaselessly pull away from it.","So, like a forgotten fire, a childhood can always flare up again within us.","Even a minor event in the life of a child is an event of that child's world and thus a world event.","If I were asked to name the chief benefit of the house, I should say: the house shelters day-dreaming, the house protects the dreamer, the house allows one to dream in peace.","Reverie is not a mind vacuum. It is rather the gift of an hour which knows the plenitude of the soul.","The subconscious is ceaselessly murmuring, and it is by listening to these murmurs that one hears the truth.","A special kind of beauty exists which is born in language, of language, and for language.","The repose of sleep refreshes only the body. It rarely sets the soul at rest. The repose of the night does not belong to us. It is not the possession of our being. Sleep opens within us an inn for phantoms. In the morning we must sweep out the shadows.","Man is a creation of desire, not a creation of need.","There is no original truth, only original error.","Ideas are refined and multiplied in the commerce of minds. In their splendor, images effect a very simple communion of souls.","Man is an imagining being.","Literary imagination is an aesthetic object offered by a writer to a lover of books.","Two half philosophers will probably never a whole metaphysician make.","The characteristic of scientific progress is our knowing that we did not know.","The words of the world want to make sentences.","The great function of poetry is to give back to us the situations of our dreams.","Poetry is one of the destinies of speech... One would say that the poetic image, in its newness, opens a future to language."],"Gaston Caperton":["That's the value of a college education... I don't know anywhere in the world where you can make an investment and make that kind of return.","It is our hope that the AP program can serve as an anchor for increasing rigor in our schools. Rigor can be maintained while increasing student participation.","Gov. Jeb Bush and the Florida Legislature's strong commitment to increase access to Advanced Placement courses continues to pay off.","The gap in education in this country, the unfairness of the schools, is one of the great unfairness in this society.","The number of students participating in A.P. has more than doubled in 10 years, and today almost 15,000 U.S. schools offer A.P. courses."],"Gaston Lachaise":["All art is a confession.","In Paris, I met a young American person who immediately became the primary inspiration which awakened my vision and the leading influence that had directed my forces. Throughout my career as an artist, I refer to this person by the word 'Woman.'"],"Gates McFadden":["Just learning to think in another language allows you to see your own culture in a better viewpoint.","I love a lot of things, and I'm pretty much obsessive about most things I do, whether it be gardening, or architecture, or music. I'd be an obsessive hairdresser.","Life is so fast these days, and we're exposed to so much information. Television makes us a witness to such misery."],"Gattlin Griffith":["I used to go in for Disney auditions, and they'd tell me, 'You're cute and nice but just not funny.'","I am pretty hard on myself. But I think that's how it has to be if you want to keep growing as an actor."],"Gautam Adani":["Being an entrepreneur is my dream job, as it tests ones tenacity.","Infrastructure sector is all about building assets for the country. It is part of nation building.","I don't like politics. I am not aligned to any political party. I have friends in all political parties.","Every economic opinion is associated with a set of assumptions.","Business is all about risk taking and managing uncertainties and turbulence.","Any commodity that sees its price going higher will see new mines opening up. When the supply increases, the prices soften. When prices fall, some mines with higher production costs will shut down as they become unviable.","Dealing with the government does not mean you have to give a bribe.","Modi government has not flouted any rule or regulation to help anyone.","I could never take orders from anyone.","Mundra Port remains committed towards setting up of world-class port infrastructure and facilities in India.","When you are in the infrastructure sector, you've to work along with the government.","One of the strengths of Adani is that, because we are controlling mines, ships, ports and logistics, we are the cheapest solution provider for end users.","My investment strategy, which is to focus on sectors that are a national priority for India, hasn't changed.","Either you are extrovert or introvert, and so I am an introvert in that sense. I'm not a social person that wants to go to parties.","I'm a school dropout. So, at the age of 16, I moved to Mumbai to try my luck on some business.","I analyse in my own way, in very simple, no-jargon language. If somebody is talking in very complicated way, I never like that.","Either you sit on the pile of cash, or you continue to grow.","Investor confidence in Adani is fairly high, and most of our investors are long-term investors.","Along with opportunities, there also exist many other tricky and complex issues to be managed in India. These include tackling both policy-level challenges and infrastructure challenges.","The upward revision of import duty, from 1 per cent to over 4 per cent on steam coal imports, will adversely impact the industry, as it will lead to increase in cost of power generation.","The commencement of coal mining at Parsa Kente is a milestone event in coal mining sector.","Adani Enterprises is well on track to realize its aim of emerging as India's largest private sector energy and logistics conglomerate.","From my experience in working with bureaucrats and politicians, if you are a credible business group, they will definitely help you. At the end of the day, they, too, want development of their constituency, state or country.","I am not attracted to those politicians who are short on vision and only want to make money. I like those who have vision."],"Gautam Gambhir":["Cricket is a team game. If you want fame for yourself, go play an individual game.","I don't enjoy cricket. I just take it as a priority... something that I have to do.","The face of the team are the people who're playing on the cricket field. The team is not about one individual.","Our flag is our identity, and we can't disrespect or let anyone else disrespect our identity.","I have never played cricket for selfish reasons like scoring 800-900 runs on flat tracks to make a comeback.","Sometimes it's important to get out of that comfort zone and, I think, try new things, and sometimes you can express yourself better.","I think a captain is someone who captains on the cricket field but, most of the leadership that happens is off the cricket field. It's very easy to captain people on the cricket field, but if you can start leading them off the cricket field, and show them that trust, what you have in them.","Sometime you need to give credit to the opposition.","At one point, when I didn't make the 2007 World Cup squad, I was very, very frustrated. Then I became very hard on myself. Whenever I used to go to the nets, or when I trained in the gym, I was very hard on myself. I couldn't sleep; I used to think a lot. Very, very desperate to make a comeback.","One thing I realised was that everyone is different. You can't compare two human beings.","A small country like Israel has compulsory military training. But countries like India, that are so much bigger, have no compulsory military training, so people don't understand how the military functions. They have no knowledge of how it works, no respect for it.","I have always maintained that bowlers win you a cricket match whatever the format.","Any quality player can adjust well to the different demands. It is like a good tennis player who is expected to adjust to the clay at the French Open, the grass at Wimbledon, the hard courts of the U.S. and the heat of the Australian Open. A professional is expected to do all that.","I can bat in the morning, afternoon, evening, night, on ice, desert, wherever and whenever. It is almost nirvana for me. It takes me away from the stresses of life.","I've always maintained - a captain is only as good as his team. It is not about my leadership, it is not about me.","I never thought of starting a cricket academy because every second person is starting a cricket academy.","I think only a batsman will be able to tell you about the goose bumps he gets after hitting a perfect cover drive. I'm one of them.","I love watching movies. I am a big movie buff.","White ball cricket can be taxing on bowlers and can be a distraction for a youngster, too.","Kolkata Knight Riders is not about me. It is about the team.","I think Delhiites know how to party, but Kolkata has people who know how to celebrate. I think that's the main difference.","To me, form is not about scoring runs but how you feel about your game. Sometimes the runs are not there, but you know you are batting well, and that is good form for me.","I came into the Indian team and was touted as someone who did well only against weaker oppositions. There were doubts creeping into my game. I was looking for support, someone to put an arm around my shoulder and say I am good and I belong to this place. Virender Sehwag is that someone for me.","When you go out on the field, you don't go out to make friends... I play to win the game and not just to compete.","Winning is something that makes people happy.","It's not a successful captain that makes a successful team.","Sometimes in a team game, the entire spotlight is on one man.","I am a very strong believer in one thing. The more physically fit you are, the more mentally fit you get.","If you ask me, a batsman has very few opportunities as compared to a bowler. A bowler knows, if he gets hit for a six or a boundary, he has another delivery left to get back and take a wicket. For a batsman, one loose shot, and you are out. A bowler will always have 24 opportunities.","IPL is good for limelight and making money.","I like finishing the games by dominating the opposition.","I think that a leader is someone that needs to make an impact on, off the cricket field and in their lives as well.","I think the only time I show my emotions and anger is on the cricket field; otherwise, I've mellowed down. And with age, I think, with age you always end up mellowing down.","When I'm playing a team sport, it's not about one individual, it's about everyone, from me to the other 23 people who were there, to all the support staff who've worked very hard behind the scenes.","I've always maintained that the problem in India is that we only give credit to big contributions.","Whatever good or bad is said by former cricketers is considered gospel. Our media should not blow out of proportion the opinion of former cricketers.","I play for India, I play for the 100 million people of my country.","I grew up playing on unprepared surfaces where your wicket depended on quickly adapting to the bounce. As a kid, I could never differentiate off-spin from leg-spin. All I looked to do was to try to hit the ball before it pitched.","Yes, I'm the same grumpy Gautam who smiles very less on the field. I go very quiet before going into the match. I guess it works for me, though my team-mates keep telling me it is just a game.","Being an impatient guy, even off the field, I would always look to score runs and score them quickly. Sometimes I panic if runs are not coming.","It used to hurt me that people thought I didn't have the technique and the temperament to play Test cricket.","I am a great believer that a captain is as good as his team.","I believe in backing players and helping them out with their game.","When you come out of your comfort zone, you can express yourself in front of the whole world, and there was no better stage to express yourself as a batsman and as a leader than IPL.","I think you need to be a leader, not a captain. You may have seen a lot of captains in this country, but the most important thing is to be a leader.","If a youngster can come up to me and share his problems or share his experiences or share something that he does off cricket, that can obviously help you build a better relation with one-on-one, and that can help you captain him on the cricket field.","When I got dropped for the World Cup, there were times I didn't want to play anymore. I didn't want to practise. I couldn't motivate myself. Then I said, 'Look what are the options?' Cricket is the only option. Whether I play happily or sadly, it's still all I have. There are not a lot of things I am good at.","Ask any batsman what gives him maximum satisfaction. It's scoring runs, whether it's Ranji Trophy or any form of the game. When you get back to your room, knowing that you have scored a hundred, it gives you satisfaction.","No one can act like Bachchan saab or bat like Virender Sehwag.","Every relation forms its own defined and non-defined rules.","In India, you need to look intense to be classified a good cricketing brain.","If you start beating opponents in their backyard is when you give yourself a chance to remain No.1.","T20 runs should only be a criteria to get selected for a T20 side. The moment you start picking players in the one-day format by their T20 performance, then you are giving your domestic 50-over competitions absolutely no relevance.","You need different skills to do well in 50-overs cricket. You need completely different skills to do well in Test cricket. You need different skills to do well in T20 cricket. It is not the same.","According to me, there couldn't be a better choice for India's coach than Anil Kumble.","Ravi Shastri has been claiming that Indian team was very successful under him, but he never told us that India lost ODI series to Bangladesh, lost ODI series to South Africa at home.","Irrespective of whether Anil Kumble is the coach or Ravi Shastri, what's more important is that India wins.","I would never go to a cinema hall to watch a biopic on a cricketer. I am not a big fan of people making biopics on sportsmen, especially cricketers. I think there are far bigger people who have done much more for the country, and films should be made on them.","When I go on to the field, it is also like my office. I have to give my 100 per cent, and I have to be really committed to it. It's all about winning.","When I am captaining a side, the way I play would be the way my team plays as well. If I will be joking around all the time, I wouldn't expect people to take me seriously.","I am a completely different person off the field, and my friends and family can vouch for that.","Sportsmen do not need Bollywood or film industry; they do not need publicity: it could be the other way round.","I am very insecure because that's how I have played cricket. Since Under-14, I was told, 'If you don't perform, you will be dropped.' I have started living with this system.","People who are talking about banning IPL, they should think about many other things that are troubling the country. People who want to look after IPL will do.","I've always wanted to do something for the defence forces - I've always said that the Army always has been my first love. It's about what they do selflessly for the country.","Call me whatever you want; I'll always speak for the Army. Without understanding the extreme conditions they're in, you can't question the extreme action they take.","People are quick to form opinions online, but they're also quick to change them. If you have an opinion, stand by it and see it through. I stand by what I put up.","I have been brought up watching the 'Rocky' series and 'First Blood' series. I am obviously a big fan of Sylvester Stallone.","My mood depends on how I treat my toothbrushes. Being a skipper is a strenuous job, and when you are going through a rough phase, obviously you start taking out your frustration. You can't take it out on anyone: you can't take it out on your teammates or your wife. The only person that is left is your toothbrush.","There is no point in winning contests if you can't leave mental scars on the minds of the opposition teams.","I have always loved the big stage and would often tell my friends while growing up that I'd want to help India win the World Cup one day.","People make a mistake thinking that two people with identical mindset gel well.","I have been a part of the teams which had the original great man - Sachin Tendulkar. I remember in 2007-08 tour of Australia, Sachin paaji would get all the attention from the locals.","Some individuals relish the fact that they are not drawing attention and can quietly go about their game while others want to show off.","I want to be part of the team that wins a Test series in England and Australia.","I know that my job is to score runs, and I will continue to do that.","I am an intense person on the field. I always want to win, as it matters to me a lot. That's why I never like to lose the focus or intensity.","Obviously, you want to get big runs. But then, as a captain, you want to play on result-oriented wickets.","You don't want to end up with a huge tally of runs after eight games but with your team out of contention.","What happens on the field should stay on the field.","Things happen on the field. It has happened between me and other players, but we always left it out there.","I am happy to lose spots on the IPL Fairplay award list, but I cannot see my team slipping on the points table.","My primary job is to score runs and make KKR win, and that's what I am trying to do. Rest, I don't think too much. That's how I have always played my game.","When I play for Delhi in Ranji Trophy, I try to help Delhi win, and when I play IPL for KKR, I aim to make KKR win.","I always believe in giving a lot of security to players. When you pick someone, you pick someone with a lot of trust and stick with that someone.","For most part of my stint as KKR leader, I have always been one of the boys: easy-going, relaxed, and a bit of a prankster.","Any opportunity you get to play for your country and wear that blue cap is an honour.","Tests are special, the format closest to my heart.","When you feel comfortable about your game, you are in a happy space, feel at peace with yourself.","A bowler will always say it's a batsman's game.","Sledging makes things interesting. There are no robots playing. They are humans who want to perform well for the country. So when stakes are so high, emotions will take over. Sometimes sledging gets the best out of you.","For me, it's fine to be aggressive and play hard. As long as you're not getting personal, it's fine, and you can do whatever you can to upset the opposition.","Yes, it is always good to contribute, but the most important thing is where we finish on the points table. That is more important to me than how many runs I score.","Strike rates depend on the surfaces you play on.","Playing on a low surface is always difficult for anyone to play their strokes. You need to be more of a grafter.","I genuinely do not even see the stats. It is just about the ability of the individual; what he brings to the table is all that matters.","Every day, I get up to hit the gym; the schedule is such that it gives me the requisite energy to last the entire day. I stress on cardiovascular exercises, and the workout is programmed with my sporting schedule. Most of the fitness schedule is based on what I require for my upcoming matches.","I do not usually follow a rigid fitness regimen, and most of it depends upon what goals I have in my mind.","One needs to be clear headed. I believe in all-round fitness.","Most of my diet is low on carbohydrates and fats.","Youngsters getting hooked to IPL is a dangerous sign for Indian cricket.","There are not enough turning pitches in India, which is why we are not getting good spinners.","When you are playing against an opposition, you want to go out there and win a game, and for that, you have to be aggressive.","As a leader, you want your team to play as you are.","Life of people of this country is far more important than any sports or any other thing.","I am talking as an Indian and not as as a cricketer. I believe we should not have any ties or relationship with Pakistan. For me, it is very important to protect our people.","I've played my whole life for Delhi; I know what is good or bad for Delhi cricket.","Ultimately, DDCA is there to promote Delhi cricket. They are not there to promote themselves or set agendas. The primary job of DDCA is to look after cricket, see where Delhi cricket is going at all levels.","I love discussing my game with people who have similar mindsets.","Ultimately, the one who scores the winning run is a finisher, irrespective of whether he's an opening batsman or No 11. What matters is how much you are contributing. If you can win matches for your team, you are a finisher.","I am very passionate about Indian hockey.","If there is hockey or football and cricket on my television, I prefer to watch hockey.","I'm aggressive on the field and a team-man to the core.","Sport doesn't work on knee-jerk reactions.","India should not have any ties with Pakistan, be it Bollywood or cricket. I am shocked that Bollywood is saying that cricket and movies should be kept ahead of national sentiments.","National interest is above anything else. Just because you sit in an air-conditioned room, you can say you shouldn't relate cricket and movies to politics. Ask anyone who has lost a family member to terror attacks, and you will get your answer.","There should be no cricket and Bollywood ties with Pakistan till Pakistan stops cross-border terrorism.","I may try and get into education. I may open a school, and that is my ultimate dream. Opening a school will give education to children, who are the future of our country. If we can educate them in a proper way, I think that will change the future of the country.","The day I feel like I can't contribute to the team's success, that's the day I am going to call it quits.","I want to do whatever will make my team win."],"Gautam Singhania":["The breaks you take from work pay you back manifold when you return because you come back with a fresher mind and newer thinking. Some of your best ideas come when you're on vacation.","Work and play go hand in hand. A lot of people want to work, work, and work until 40, and then relax. Who says you'll get to 40? Or 50? Who knows what'll happen in the next five minutes? The only reality is the present. And if you can't learn to live in the moment, you'll never be content.","It's impossible to be someone you're not, so quit trying. I am as passionate about my hobbies as I am about my work and my family. All three are equally important to me at all times.","Most people who go to Rajasthan go to Udaipur, Jodhpur or Jaipur.","When people go to Ladakh, they go to Leh; they don't go to everything in the middle.","The fun of sitting around Pangong Lake with 40 guys around a fireplace, having a glass of wine... staying in one camp together... that's an experience. Waking up at 5 in the morning, watching the sun come up. You don't do these things in Bombay.","To customers, it's the shirt that matters, not where it's made.","I'd love to get into the hospitality industry, but I just don't have the time.","I feel very strongly that you shouldn't mix your emotions with business. When it comes to my emotions, I certainly don't mix them with my business.","I think management and technology all come into play in building a super-yacht. It is a challenge - a serious challenge.","Boats are something I am very, very passionate about; cars are something I grew up with... I used to race cars since I was a child.","I don't think even one per cent of the people in this world explore more than 10 per cent of all that this world has to offer. That's a shame!"],"Gavid Hood":["For me, one of the privileges of being a writer is to poke your nose around and learn about worlds you don't know.","The truth about filmmaking is you have all these ideas and you're trying to convince everybody that they should buy into this idea, but at two o'clock in the morning when you're all on your own you're going, 'Geez, I hope I know what I'm doing. I hope this idea is gonna work.'","The first prize for any production is, if you can find a location that means you don't have to build sets, that will serve, and is not excessively expensive to hire, then it can save you a lot of money.","I think people forget that a lot of directing is just real management of the size of a production.","It is a myth to think that sometimes creative disagreement doesn't necessarily produce a better result.","You can sustain visual beauty and innovative visual ideas for a certain length of time, but in a two-hour experience, which is really what movies are, usually audiences - whether they know it or not - most want an emotional connection to character.","The truth about people at every economic level of life is you get those who are kind and who are not, those who are greedy, whether they be rich or poor. That's a common thread through humanity on any street you go to.","My first experience with film was through a still camera. I would sit, very much against my will, with my father in the game reserve, watching some elephant or rhino or whatever, through a 400 millimeter lens and wait, and waiting and waiting.","When you're used to looking through a stills lens and you have to capture an emotional moment, and that picture is not moving and yet it has to have impact, I think that's the first influence on my style."],"Gavin Andresen":["In the future, I expect to see bitcoin mining in places where electricity is free or cheap. You could put solar array in the Arizona desert attached to bitcoin miners, and instead of trying to ship that electricity all over world, you could ship Bitcoin all over the world.","Just as it got easier to use email, it will be easier to use Bitcoin as people invest in it and become more familiar with it.","I think the best projects understand that they don't need to invent a new currency. They don't need to use the block chain as their long-term data storage solution. And they don't need to use the peer-to-peer network as their communication mechanism. They should use the block chain as the world's most secure distributed ledger.","My salary is converted to bitcoin, and taxes are taken out. You have to do all the tax computations in dollars because the IRS does not deal in bitcoins.","There's a lot of thought that bitcoin will be a huge threat to existing tax systems or existing ways governments have of controlling currency flows across their border. I personally think governments will do what governments have always done: they will adapt.","I don't see myself as the king of Bitcoin. I don't want to be the king of Bitcoin.","Bitcoin as a globally distributed public ledger - that's the thing I'm most excited about going forward. Thinking about how to use Bitcoin in new and innovative ways. In the meantime, we have the boring uses of Bitcoin that are in the process of going mainstream.","Until part of your paycheck is regularly paid in Bitcoin, I'm not sure how it would really go mainstream. I can imagine places in the world where there are not functioning banking systems or payroll systems, where it could go mainstream first because you're not trying to replace the way people are already doing something.","The regulation picture has gotten a lot clearer in the U.S. and most of Europe. And that's fantastic. I think that's why you're seeing companies like Microsoft and Dell accepting Bitcoins.","You really want some natural way for people to get Bitcoins, as part of their paycheck or some other activity so they can turn around and spend them. It's much better if the Bitcoin economy is a self-contained thing.","I'm most excited about all of the non-currency uses of the block chain's ledger-ordering ability. I have no idea which ones will turn out to be successful, but I'm glad all of that experimenting is happening."],"Gavin Bryars":["Craft is part of the creative process.","It's rather like attending a university seminar where you are talking to a few gifted specialists who deliver a paper to an audience of their peers. That's one way of making music.","What was once underground is now coming to the surface.","People like Arvo Part would not have been taken seriously 20 years ago.","Music history has flowed under the bridges for many years.","Writing tonal music now, you are not writing into the 19th Century.","There's another way of making music, by touching the lives and feelings of ordinary people.","The academic area of new music or modern music festivals is not something which attracts me at all.","Still, American composers working in France have had a pretty hard time.","Somehow in the 20th Century an idea has developed that music is an activity or skill which is not comprehensible to the man in the street. This is an arrogant assertion and not necessarily a true one.","Similarly you can make a transition from one set of instruments to another imperceptibly.","Over the years I have tried to develop something which is technically assured.","It makes sense to invest in new work. It's almost like having a research department in a scientific laboratory. You have to try things out. You'll make some bad mistakes. Some things will fail but at least you'll energise the organisation.","I've heard though that there is a younger generation of tonal French composers who are reacting with vigour.","I work very fast, keeping the ideas flowing but making sure they come out the way I intended.","I know that John Adams has had a very hard time directing French ensembles.","I have friends who have a CD mastering plant in Hollywood and they are very sceptical about European record labels' understanding of digital technology.","I currently spend a lot of time thinking about orchestration and every detail of a piece.","I am writing something which I find satisfying and which I am prepared to put my name to as a composer.","As I had collaborated with visual artists before whether on installations, on performance pieces, in the context of theatre works and as I had taught for a time in art colleges the idea of writing music in response to painting was not alien.","I remember once, when I started writing for the alto saxophone, a saxophonist told me to think of it as being like a cross between an oboe and a viola, but louder.","Like an apparently strict musical form it breaks the five minute whole into its structural parts - a descriptive preamble, the action of taking the cards, the development of the cards' manipulation and the revelation of what has been achieved.","One thing I'm doing on the new Titanic recording is actually bringing in different acoustic spaces.","The project which we developed, however, was for a sound piece and I was initially curious that a sculptor should be interested in working with a musician, especially on a project for radio.","When Philip Glass asked me if I would be interested in doing a new recording of Jesus' Blood he assumed that I would do something similar to the first version and wanted to know what other pieces would be on the same CD."],"Gavin Creel":["I have no idea why we bleed maize and blue, but we do. There's something about Michigan. Maybe it's that we're less jaded out there in the Midwest, I don't know, but it's a love of what we do and each other that brings us together. It's just a magic place.","The most powerful thing we can do is get involved locally. Help our local community and become community activists in our own smaller circle.","It doesn't inspire young men and women struggling with their own sexuality to be confident in who they are if I'm not confident in who I am.","I think what everybody really wants is attention; we just want someone to pay attention to us.","I don't like to hold too much formality in concerts. It's not that I don't like seeing people who are really polished and put together. But I'm more excited by things that are a little bit breaking apart as you're watching them.","I'm not much for formality.","I'm sick of people putting boxes around everyone, telling you where and how you have to fit in.","The most real thing of all, the only thing any of us wants, is to matter to somebody. To feel and share love, even on a friendship level or as deep as a romantic one. Who doesn't want that?","There's something about a live theater performance: You can't fake it.","I can't live without my music player.","One thing I wanted to say in my Tony speech, which I didn't because I forgot what I was doing because I couldn't believe the view from where I was standing, was that I really, truly believe in an investment in young people in the arts. It is an investment in a more beautiful world.","I feel that the arts have an impact in a way that just makes the world more beautiful.","My mom and dad have always, always, and continue to be the most incredible citizens of the world and most generous in quiet ways, that I strive to do even a fraction of what they do.","The older I've gotten, and the more that I've worked, I cherish that I'm an Ohio boy because, at the end of the day, I believe that I'm a talented person; I believe that I work really hard, but I think that the main reason I'm successful is because I'm kind, I'm easy to work with, and I'm a team player.","I hope that my lyrics have a way that they're so specific they become universal, and they go, 'Oh I've been there, I know what that's like.'","I love Kim Kardashian. There, I've said it.","The funny thing about New York City is that if you hide from her, she's just gonna say, 'Whatever, kid!' and leave you in the dust.","I still don't go to gay bars all that often, but the difference now is that I'm not not going because I'm afraid, but rather I'm not going now because I don't want to get off the couch.","Some scenes are just more people's thing than others, and I know that my Gay New York is truly whatever I make of it. If I want her loud and lively, she's there. If I want sunsets and starlight, Battery Park, here I come.","Love her or leave her, there is no place quite like N.Y.C.","I have never really referred to my voice as 'gay.'","I don't agree with those in our community who think that, as gay people, we are special and should therefore keep ourselves isolated from certain straight-associated thinking or conventions.","You put these politicians in office, but then you've got to tell them what you want them to do. And it's intimidating to most people. I was intimidated by it. I mean, calling my senator or writing my senator? I'm like, what do I say? What do I do? But we're showing people that the political process is actually less intimidating than we think.","Tina Fey writes crazy, off-color, racist, hilarious stuff for '30 Rock,' but it's always funny because you're in this almost two-dimensional world where there's Jenna Maroney and these over-the-top characters. That's the framework.","I have to be able to have music at all times - to shower to, to listen to, to warm up, to dance.","I am not a sex symbol of the Broadway community. I know guys who are, and I say, 'Rock it out.' But I'm more comfortable in a different land. I don't know what land it is, but not that one.","I'd be lying if I said that I didn't want to do a TV show or movie, but life comes first, and then there's business. If this business doesn't allow me to have my life, then I'll do something else and be a happier man.","I looked at 'Us Weekly' and said, 'I want to be famous.'","It's really hard to go into a creative process and not think, 'I might or might not get nominated for a Tony.'","I want to be respected by my peers and do really great work, even if it gets panned, even if I get raked across the coals.","I want to know that I'm proud of what I'm doing.","I like creating stuff and projects, but at the same time, I do like sometimes just having a routine with somebody else telling me where to go, what time to be there.","Sometimes when I do a musical, they'll be a scene that comes up, and I'm like, 'Oh, I hate this scene,' but you get through it.","When I did 'Thoroughly Modern Millie,' it was almost every 'first' I could have imagined: I dreamt someday being on Broadway, and then dreamt someday playing a lead on Broadway, and then dreamt someday of getting to originate a role, and then getting a Tony nomination. It all happened at once. I was just terrified.","I like singing too much, and I believe in the art form, the musical. When it's great, there's nothing better, and when it's bad, there's nothing worse.","To be an actor, it's really tough to find your own voice because you're always tied to other characters and going to auditions and trying to get a job, hoping they'll pick you. And I think it's just so important for an actor to have something else that's creative, something that's creative and you're in charge of.","I think the '60s were a time where they were singing about what was going on around them.","I guess I originally got the bug for performing when I was in choirs and school stuff and all that. I don't know when. I guess I decided to do it because a lot of people said I was good, and I liked the attention.","I wanted to be a movie director. I was just obsessed with watching movies and camera shots and directors. I read autobiographies and stuff of directors.","When people smile in your direction when you do something, you tend to continue to do it.","I have a Bachelor's of Fine Arts in Musical Theatre.","After Obama was elected president, the same day Proposition 8 was passed, there was this fire in our belly.","I have been a nomad for most of my thirties, even creatively.","Musical theater has sort of always been there for me, but I haven't always treated it with the same reverence as it's treated me.","I love Jason Robert Brown.","I don't want to fit in. I want to make music that can reach out to people of all different ages and backgrounds and beliefs and turn us into one, groovin, 'Goodtimenation.'","I'm tired of all the angry stuff out there.","I was never late to a show more often than 'La Cage.' Because I lived close, and I didn't really do anything in that show.","I want to be a poster boy for the uncool.","I am a showoff, the third of three kids.","I have two older sisters who were phenomenal sportsmen.","I was really proud to be in that show. I will never forget. I got the script to 'Millie,' and I'm flipping through the script and saying, 'Boy, I have some lines... I have a big song.' I was 25 years old and had never been on Broadway before. I got to the end of the script, and I was really nervous and excited. I realized I had a lot to do.","My life is my life, and I'll live it.","I've always been a believer in the power of art - and music in particular - to inspire change.","I've always had a plan for my music career.","I feel like we're constantly getting better musically, and more of what's in my heart and head is coming through.","Maybe some of the pronouns have changed, but I've always been honest in my music.","I think 'Hair' is the kind of show that benefits from the live experience - it needs to be seen and heard.","At the end of the day, I always maintain you can substitute 'The Book of Mormon' for 'The Bible: The Musical' or 'The Quran: The Musical.'","Watching President Obama, for the first time in my life, one of us was running for president. He seemed like one of us - and I got behind him, and I got excited about his message and what he continues to say he's going to do. The day he was elected president, Prop 8 happened. It was this bizarre dichotomy - world history - good and bad.","I'm a huge 'South Park' fan, loved 'Avenue Q,' and can not wait to work with Trey Parker, Matt Stone, Bobby Lopez, and Casey Nicholaw.","We have the ability to change people's minds and hearts - that's what we want to do with theatre. That's what theatre does... period.","Being from the theatre, I am always interpreting someone else's thoughts and feelings.","It's exhilerating to be able to explore my own voice.","I auditioned at four different colleges. When I got into the University of Michigan, my parents said, 'Okay, maybe you do have talent.'","I'm pretty independent.","The tech rehearsal for Brits is so different. They have little glasses of wine and walk around saying, 'Lovely, darling, lovely.'","I have so many passions. I'm just going to keep trying to go forward and see where they take me.","There's no way you can deliver 'the greatest musical of the century.'","I was in 'Hair,' which didn't work in London, but it was a show we all believed in."],"Gavin DeGraw":["You can be a singer, and you can be a guitar player, but putting them together is another animal.","I took a lot of time to open myself up to taking chances musically.","We have a George Foreman grill on the bus.","I don't want to see Superman replaced with Superboy.","I was introduced to country music around a campfire on a farm.","There's always some amount of gradual, slow burning destruction over the course of partying.","I think listening to real classic soul material made me learn how to feel music that's sung.","I live in a bus and go from place to place and sometimes feel very detached from what's going on.","When I was a kid I got busted for throwing a rock through a car window and egging a house on halloween.","I like to do the splits onstage.","It's not my goal to be a famous actor.","I love to play music.","I miss that sensation of a small achievement feeling like a really big deal.","I happen to be a guy who also plays the piano and sings, so people automatically associate me with Billy Joel.","My dad didn't want me to play guitar. He played piano, so I chose that. And I ended up loving it.","The early Billy Joel stuff I fell in love with, like Glass Houses, is a real rock record.","When my grandfather died, I started adopting some of his accents, to sort of remind myself of him. A homage. He was a war hero, and he was really great with his hands.","Women are the first to jump on what is fashionable.","So when you start touring, women are definitely going to check you out first.","I don't take my clothes off in my videos.","So if I was dating somebody now and the relationship didn't work out, I'd take that as failing.","I'm very competitive, and my ego couldn't handle that lack of success.","I don't want to be anything other than what I've been trying to be lately.","I don't really take a step back too often to see what's going on.","I guess I'm happy that I'm getting the attention. Otherwise, I'd just be playing in a local bar in front of my family members, and I'm sure they'd get sick of that in no time.","When people put that sort of pressure on you, you're worried that people won't want to receive you.","So I try not to have any actual expectations for myself for any level of success or failure.","I may never get my own action figure, but at least I think what I'm doing is really legitimate musically.","But I've never considered myself any kind of heartthrob. It sounds painful.","I'm like a junkie for writing.","So yeah, I play the piano for most of the show, but I like rock and roll.","I could tell it was a popular move as a writer to walk down the bass lines while you were writing a song.","Playing in front of people is a lot different from playing in your room.","I can do a gig without an instrument."],"Gavin Hood":["In the comic-book lore, of course, you mutate post a traumatic event. You must have the mutant gene, but if something traumatic happens to you, usually at puberty, then that mutation manifests itself.","Part of what's so tricky in a film that's two hours long is how many themes can you effectively explore.","Most big popcorn movies are 'bad guy does something to good guy, good guy gets revenge on bad guy, sets the world right, and moves on.' And 'Ender's Game' is just not that simple, so it's an exciting challenge. It's a little terrifying, and let's see how audiences respond.","The reality is that art has often risen to greater heights than the people who created it. Many flawed artists have created great works of art. You have to decide if you are going to listen to Richard Wagner's music or not because he was very anti-Semitic.","For me, emotion comes first. If I have to change a scene, invent a scene, change dialogue, or put Graff by the lake in order to feel that dynamic, and the end results feels like 'Ender's Game,' then hopefully it works.","My tools, my medium, include pictures and live actors.","The question I ask myself when adapting a book is how do I be true to the spirit and soul of the character? How would I describe this character in my medium? If you asked one person to do a painting of something and another to create a sculpture of it, you'll never ask, 'Why doesn't the painting look like the sculpture?'","'Ender's Game' has fabulous opportunities for spectacle, where appropriate, but there's also a tremendous central character. It's a balance.","There's always a theme I'm drawn to, that we humans are not good or bad. We're all a mixture of both. We can have great compassion or commit great violence.","I was drafted when I was 17, and I spent two years, and I lost a friend in war.","I worked initially in very low-budget independent films that I often wrote. My early work was all written by myself, and then I adapted 'Tsotsi,' so I was used to the writing process being, in a way, integral to my directing. I felt it really prepared me.","I learned a lot doing 'Wolverine,' and I was also very fortunate, in the sense that I got to do a huge number of visual effects shots.","The truth about people at every economic level of life is you get those who are kind and who are not, those who are greedy, whether they be rich or poor. That's a common thread through humanity on any street you go to.","Athol Fugard became famous as a playwright, so although 'Tsotsi' the book was written in the '60s, it was only published in the '80s. It was then optioned pretty much every year by producers. I think the problem was that holding onto its period setting made it very hard to get finance.","In the early '90s, I was hired to write educational dramas about HIV and AIDS in the shantytowns. I did that for two and a half years, and then I was hired on other films. When 'Tsotsi' presented itself, I thought, 'This is not a world I grew up in, but I've spent a great deal of time writing about it and researching it in my past.'","When we watch stories, we learn empathy, we learn compassion, and hopefully we achieve some sort of understanding.","I don't know many South Africans who don't have their eyes wide open to what it's like to be exposed to some sort of violence. The question is whether we choose to be cynical about it or not.","What's genius about 'Gravity' is that you are close upon the actors, but 3D works best when you have foreground, middle ground and background.","3D prefers you to use wider lenses because when things are out of focus, and yet it's in 3D, it bothers you."],"Gavin MacLeod":["Also, now as a result of that show being on, the cruise industry is just growing all over the place. Princess Cruises, who I now represent, is the fastest growning cruise line in the world.","This is a group effort. This is group theatre. This is no big star turn. You could do things with it to do that but it would just be out of kilter. This is one reason I like this play. This is a unit.","That's one of the reasons I wanted to be an actor, to be like them. And there they were at my table, all talking about how nervous they were, about the lines, and so forth. No matter how big you get, you still have the same kinds of anxieties and so forth.","We had to be very careful on our best behaviour when we went to these other countries. And then I made a living, I had a chance to support my wife and my kids. It was a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful program from that point of view.","We have nine ships and in the next two years will have ten, eleven and twelve. So things are going very nicely and all because of that program that people thought was mindless and so forth.","I went over to shoot for six days. It turned out to be ten days, very nicely so. A little money.","But the character was so successful, that first one, that they wrote him again and he came in right at the end of the first year in a show called THE BOX. I was up for the Emmy for that one too.","I've played heavies for years and years and years. I was bald. I came to Hollywood. I did a play about junk. I was a pusher, so I played pushers for years and years and years. I did war movies and things like that.","I haven't killed anyone on television in years and years. Must have been twenty something years.","It was tough for him in that newsroom with Ted Baxter getting all the glory and this poor guy doing all the work. Murray worried so much he worried his hair off!","We used two Princess Cruise ships. The Island Princess and The Pacific Princess. They were identical ships.","It all depended on the cut. Some of them were really on the ship. Some were really on the set. Like if they had the stars for a week, the stars coming off, that was usually on the set, except if we were on location for that particular show.","We went out for six weeks a year. We first started in Mexico and we did that for so many years that we finally said we've got to explore and start going globally. And then we started going all over the world.","It's very trying on a marriage when you're doing a one hour show, week after week after week. You don't have enough time for people that maybe you should have top priority.","I just love the hours of the theatre, I love the way it operates. I always say that when you're doing a play it's like getting a shot of B12, and when you do television for a long series you need a shot of B12.","I always think that I love doing what I'm doing at the moment. The past is over. I can't go play one of those characters again. But I can play this and I can continue to grow in what I'm doing at the moment and that's really what I'm thinking about now.","There are a lot of new opportunities that are poking their head up in my future. I've been very fortunate that way, but for right now, what I like is what I'm doing.","I'm just there to do interviews and stuff, because we have about 40 media people there, so it's a very, very busy week. But that's the only time. I did marry, I think on one show, about 25 couples in Acapulco Bay once, but that was all just for kicks.","We were making new ones the second year. We were in syndication the second year. So we were on Saturday nights, prime time, every morning, and then they put it on Sunday evenings too. So it was all over the place.","Somebody did an article in one of the newspapers saying that at that time I had the most visibility of any actor around. Kind of nice, you know, when that thing was happening.","You know, you have to put bread on the table. So you thank God you got the job.","I checked myself out in that funeral parlour scene. I saw myself laughing, because there was a shot of Ed and I together and Mary was right in back of us. My head turned from the camera and I saw myself laughing, because Mary was absolutely brilliant in that thing.","This is a group playing together and that's the only way, I feel, this play can be successful and moving. I am so lucky to have the people that are in it. When I came here I didn't know who was going to be in the play.","We sat down and read it for the first time and I thanked God under my breath, because they were all so good. And my leading ladies are both exceptional. I mean, everybody in the play. I could just go on all night about them."],"Gavin Newsom":["An arts education helps build academic skills and increase academic performance, while also providing alternative opportunities to reward the skills of children who learn differently.","Take responsibility. Step up and step in. Because at the end of the day, folks, we are our behaviors.","You need to let go of your fear and anxiety of being judged by others.","The tech genie is out of the bottle; you can't put it back in.","The 21st Century has begun as an era of uncertainty, with a heightened focus on security and public safety.","You can love me or hate me and disagree with me, but you sure as hell know where I stand.","These Millennials are volunteering more; they're smarter than ever.","I've never been a fan of pretense or procrastination. After all, our state is defined by its independent, outspoken spirit.","Involvement in the arts engages kids in their community, improves self-esteem, reclaims at-risk youth, and builds the creative skills that are required of a 21st century workforce.","If Wikileaks didn't resolve that question for folks - at the end of the day, there are no secrets. We're living in a glass neighborhood, in a fishbowl, and technology, white hat hackers, the folks that are doing the right thing with hacking.","The question for politicians here is fundamental: You can read the polls, or you can change the polls. Stand up on the things you believe in.","President Trump is quick to attack American students, immigrants, women, the LGBT community, journalists, and our international allies but he is either too weak or too ignorant to stand up to white supremacists and others who spew hatred.","You've got to change incentives for good behavior as opposed to just disincentivizing bad behavior.","There was a lot of hype about social media in President Obama's first campaign. It was important, but it wasn't as important as I think people let on.","The value of an arts education is widely accepted, especially in California.","San Franciscans know we live in the most beautiful city in the world, a jewel on the edge of the Golden Gate.","Like any small business owner, I experienced the pressures of building a company from the ground up - developing a business plan, balancing the books, meeting payroll and building a customer base.","At the end of the day, there's not a day that goes by without a mass shooting.","We can build new housing while preserving the quality and character of adjacent residential districts and ensuring infill development strengthens the surrounding neighborhood.","San Francisco businesses face many challenges, including high rents, regulatory burdens, and the rising cost of workers compensation insurance and employee health plans.","We do not have the right to discriminate against people.","Society becomes how we behave.","We are not going to turn our backs on people who have been persecuted, turn our backs on people who have been threatened by terror.","If we continue to fight the National Rifle Association on their home court, which is the legislative front, I think we'll continue to be frustrated. But when you have an ability to go directly to the public, that's a completely different field of engagement, and I think the NRA is not adept at that kind of engagement.","I made bad decisions. That being said - the question is, does the public care about that?","My mother - it's not one of those waxing-poetic kind of things - she literally worked two or three jobs most of her life. So I personally experienced that, even though I had these great friends and associations who had unlimited amounts of money. That juxtaposition was an interesting one.","One of the defining dynamics of 2008 has been the emerging wave of new, young voters getting involved and storming the gates of the traditional political establishment.","San Francisco has long been a leader in the arts, nurturing generations of painters, sculptors, poets, novelists, playwrights, film-makers, and performing artists and innovators of every kind.","We recognize that the arts are an essential part of San Francisco's cultural vitality.","Cultural tourism surveys consistently rate San Francisco's art industry as a core reason for visiting.","The arts can play a vital role in revitalizing neighborhoods, using and improving vacant space, bringing new jobs and new sense of opportunity, and improving public safety by generating more foot traffic and more eyes on the street.","As Mayor, I will fully support my Arts Commission and its professional selection committees so that they can commission a full range of public art that is daring and, when appropriate, daringly traditional.","As Mayor, I will lead city government, businesses, and community groups to support innovative projects that will make San Francisco streets and public places vibrant and healthy.","Livable neighborhoods with a vibrant street life will stimulate our economic life as well.","Street and park trees provide tremendous benefits to cities.","Historically, San Franciscans have not valued street trees as much as other communities have.","San Francisco lags behind other communities in providing a vital, vibrant and ecologically sustainable urban canopy, as well as open space in the city.","But living in uncertain times does not mean San Franciscans must live in fear.","City government can and must help San Franciscans prepare for emergencies in order to avoid tragedy where possible and minimize loss of life and property when emergencies occur.","As Mayor of San Francisco, I will work hard to ensure that, in the event of natural or man-made disasters, San Franciscans are prepared and our City is protected.","As mayor of San Francisco, I will provide the vision and work hard to make San Francisco a beautiful, well-planned city with excellent housing and transportation options.","During the 1990s, San Francisco lived through one of the most intense economic booms of its history.","San Francisco can no longer afford to be a city divided between downtown and neighborhoods, with a downtown that becomes a ghost town when workers go home for the evening.","As Mayor, I will use my experience to make San Francisco a place where small businesses can thrive.","Accessing capital to start a business can be a daunting process, especially for entrepreneurs who start out with a great idea, but have no real familiarity with the business world.","We need to allow people to bypass government... to look to themselves for solving problems rather than asking the government to do things for them.","Government is the ultimate monopoly. And monopolies, as any economist will tell you, often breed complacency and a lack of innovation.","Government doesn't have to come up with new killer features on its own. It has to step aside and let others come up with them.","Government can do best by simply getting out of the way.","I'm sick and tired of politics and politicians as usual.","I'll be kicked out before I rust out.","California is infamous for passing things and then waking up and saying, 'What the hell did we just pass?'","Are we going to solve the issue of poverty? Absolutely not. Are we going to have an impact? I'm committed to it, and if we don't, I'll have no regrets because we're going to try everything we can.","When you have a good idea, the money flows.","You don't have to be something to do something.","We must continue to step in and stand up to resist reckless rhetoric and actions in a peaceful and forceful manner.","As goes California, so goes the rest of the nation.","California is a bellwether state. California was the first state in the United States to overturn the laws against interracial marriage. It took 19 years for the rest of the country to come around to that point of view.","Do I support a driver's license for everybody? The answer is yes.","I'm not courting labor. I come from a labor background. To me, it's just intuitive.","I'm much more optimistic about this next generation because this is the first global generation.","If you're not open, you're not transparent, you're still holding on to vaults of information, you're not going to build that trust.","My daughter's met Hillary Clinton, so she's got a strong bias. But she, of course, parrots me and goes, 'Oh, Donald Trump, I don't like him!' I'm like, 'That's good!'","I have a very successful father-in-law and family with very different political views.","If you're trying to understand why it is that certain things happen in Sacramento and certain things don't, at the end of the day, it comes down to the issue of incentives: We do what we're incentivized to do.","I don't want to let the rest of this country drift into the abyss. I want to fight for it.","We have rules that no longer are relevant to the world we're living in. Our regulatory system can't keep up.","There's something called CEQA in California - NEPA at the federal level. There's indigenous lands and autonomies relating to governance on those lands. There are all kinds of obstructions as it relates to just getting zoning approval and getting building permits.","Guys like me don't necessarily progress very far, which is fine.","Founders Den provides the kind of collaborative and creative atmosphere to foster new ideas not only for emerging new businesses, but government as well.","The Republican Party - that was the end of the Republican Party. What Pete Wilson did with the xenophobia and the negative attitude, all this sort of anti-crime backlash.","Even if Donald Trump's successful, it's the beginning of the end if this rhetoric persists in the Republican Party.","The kind of cynical politics of divide and conquer, that's shameful stuff, and I don't know - people live their life like that, but I don't know how they look back and feel good about themselves.","There's a secret sauce in California, and I hope people pay attention to it.","I act on my principles, whether they're popular or not.","No-Drama Obama? Yeah, that's not me.","Do what you think is right, because one damn thing is an absolute, certainly: We come and go. Politicians are a dime a dozen.","People don't care anymore because they don't believe in us; they don't trust us. And that's why we should change politics, not just accept the cynical frame that, 'Well, that's just politics.'","If you distill the essence of everything, what life is about, every single one of us is given a short moment in time on this planet, and we all have one universal need and desire, and that is to be loved and to love. And to deny that for your own political expediency, I don't want to live in that column. It ain't worth it.","People always thought I'd never get elected outside San Francisco; I was always more worried that I'd never get elected again inside San Francisco.","Californians are blessed with the remarkable leadership of Gov. Jerry Brown, who... has led our state to firm fiscal footing and brought us to the enviable position of dreaming - and achieving - big dreams again.","You'd be hard pressed to find a bigger champion of high-speed rail than me when the bond went to voters. I believed in it.","Since Sandy Hook, I have sat back as a father and been mesmerized by the inability of the federal government to do anything substantively on gun safety.","Good people can disagree.","Separate is not equal. Civil unions are civil unions. Marriage is marriage. They're different institutions.","It was difficult to realize, 'I'm lieutenant governor.' And Brown appropriately reminded me of that.","The economy is not immutable; it's not about natural laws. It's about rules, and we make the rules.","If, in this country, a simple majority of people can start stripping away the rights of a protected class in the minority, that's a pretty alarming thing.","Prop 8 did something that no other state in the history of this country has done. It took away the rights of people that already were legally affirmed. Imagine someone putting something on the ballot saying your wedding, your marriage is no longer valid.","Separate inherently is not equal. There's a reason why $45 million was spent against marriage equality. It's because people understand the word does have meaning. And equality comes when we accept the same notions and the same institutions for everyone, regardless of race and gender and regardless of sex orientation.","People don't have to agree with me. They can say, 'My gosh, I can't believe I'm listening to this guy. I can't disagree with him more.' But at least they know that I'm going to fight for things that I believe in. And I don't need to be in formal office to do that.","I really feel it's time to dissolve the current relationship of governor and lieutenant governor by running as a ticket.","When Californians see something we truly believe in, we say so and act accordingly - without evasiveness or equivocation.","I don't know many better training grounds than being mayor of San Francisco - those were pretty intense years in terms of reporting and scrutiny.","I will negotiate with my worst enemy.","A mistake that a lot of us have made, related to those who advocate for gun safety legislation, is that we try to process it through our legislative bodies, and that's where the NRA's strength lies.","There's been a gap between perception and reality, the perception being that California is on the cutting edge of gun safety legislation when, in fact, there are a number of areas where we have fallen behind.","Even though he's a third-generation San Franciscan, my father's very European in some ways, and he loves wine.","I think Thanksgiving is the perfect occasion to break open a buttery, oaky Chardonnay from California.","The whole idea that the Constitution of the United States would be used to advance a political agenda is absurd.","I have differences of opinion within my own family, an Irish Catholic family. So, I do respect those that disagree.","The people that are serving you gas, the people that are in your restaurants serving you, the firefighters, and police officers are members of the gay and lesbian community. They're members of our broader community.","I'm not a pundit. I don't want to be a pundit.","I'm really more of an executive.","You only get one chance in this thing called life. I know that is a bit maudlin and obscure, but it's a fact, and you can make a profound difference in people's lives without having a title in front of your name.","There is nothing worse than a politician that gets defensive and starts attacking the media - and it always looks bad for the politician, because you sign up for this. You live by the sword, you die by the sword.","I did not love reading, spelling, math and science. I struggled. I was a terrible speller.","Just because you have a learning difficulty or difference doesn't mean you aren't smart.","I don't learn in a certain way, but I have other skills.","While it was refreshing to finally see an openly gay man speak at a Republican convention, it doesn't remove the stain of selecting Mike Pence, America's most anti-LGBT governor.","Make no mistake: conversion therapy is not about 'praying away the gay.' It's an emotional torture against our most innocent citizens: our children.","I just butcher a book. Everything I underline I assume is important to me.","Sometimes I will make CliffsNotes of my CliffsNotes.","It's nature-nurture, right? I've been nurtured by Californians.","If high-wage, high-cost nations like Germany and Japan can compete on exports, California can."],"Gavin O'Connor":["My brother and I were separated when I was a child; we went with different parents.","The thing I learned from 'Pride and Glory' is that people like to feel a little better leaving the theater than they did coming in.","The thing about Moby Dick is that, at heart, it's a very simple plot - there's only one white whale in the ocean. When you're a boy growing up in a hostile home, you imagine it's unique: it's happening only to you.","I always say to my agents, you go through one of these big kind of movies, everyone makes money, but like, I said, 'I'm the one who's gotta go make it, and if I don't have my heart in it, and it's like a love affair, I'm not going to do a good job. Then, and I don't want to just get paid. I just, I don't want to do that.'","At least I want to be making films that are somehow born out of me that are stories I want to tell. The challenge is figuring out how to do it where you can make them personal, yet still deliver to an audience a film experience that is satisfying and emotional, and that's what I'm trying to do.","I always intended the title, 'WARRIOR,' to be about spiritual warfare and warrior lives outside of the cage.","Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to make films. That's really all I ever wanted to do.","Sundance is going to be a defining moment in my life. But the unfortunate thing about Sundance is, when you have a film there, you can't have the opportunity to see other films.","As a kid, when most of my friends were into Superman and Batman, there was only one superhero who held my interest - The Green Hornet.","The Green Hornet was a human superhero. And he didn't wear a clown costume. And he was a criminal - in the eyes of the law - and in the eyes of the criminal world.","With the rights now in our loving hands, I'm beyond excited to bring 'The Green Hornet' into the 21st century in a meaningful and relevant way: modernizing it and making it accessible to a whole new generation. My intention is to bring a gravitas to 'The Green Hornet' that wipes away the camp and kitsch of the previous iteration.","I want to re-mythologize 'The Green Hornet' in a contemporary context, with an emphasis on story and character, while at the same time incorporating themes that speak to my heart.","I remember, after 'Tumbleweeds,' my friend and I wrote 'Pride and Glory.' I was just about to get it going. I had some really great actors attached, and New Line was going to make the movie, and 9/11 happened. And it was over. By September 12, it was over. And rightfully so. I understood that.","Being a dad is like - there's nothing more important. So the exploration of that in stories, with parents and fathers and brothers, siblings, I just think that you're always in the terrain of love, whether it's absence of love or the giving of love or the desire for love.","From when I was 7 until I was 22, I played football. That was always my struggle as a kid. I always wanted to be an artist, but my parents were divorced, and my dad really wanted me to play sports, and that's how I got to see him. He would come pick me up or take me to practice, and he was always at my games.","I'm going to go do a Netflix series. It's straight-to-series, 10 episodes, probably go for three seasons. I'm going to direct the pilot and hopefully the last episode of the first season. The show is 'Seven Seconds.'","The script is just a blueprint.","When you do scenes that are just exposition, they feel false."],"Gavin Rossdale":["A happy wife is a happy life.","Being real is what is important.","I love what I'm doing most of the time, but it's hard work. People only see your albums in the charts. They see us at award shows and after-show parties. They don't know about your doubts, the hard work that goes in.","Wherever you look there are inspirations, books, literature, paintings, landscapes, everything. Just living is an inspiration.","The more I talk about things, the more I understand myself.","I have always been fascinated by dark and mysterious stuff. I guess I have a pretty dark and gloomy side. Writing songs saves me from going completely gonzo.","Any reaction is better than none.","I quite like Low, the band from Minnesota. They're absolutely mesmerizing. I get much the same feeling from anything that Will Oldham does.","The only people who benefit from lawsuits are lawyers. I think we made a couple of them rich.","I'm not a workaholic, but I was a bit manic, I have to confess.","As much as we all love playing live, it's not normal to be on the road all the time, to have no home.","I think it's pretty normal that there are a lot of people out there who don't like us.","For some critics we might be uncool on account of our popularity.","It's pretty hard to make out what's going to be a commercial success and what's not.","I always wrote about things that were important to me. I think our past success showed that it was also important for a lot of others.","I don't know any musician who got to the top without hard work. Take whoever you want. They all work bloody hard, harder than you think.","As an artist, you're pretty sheltered backstage. You often don't know what's going on out there.","If you just keep your head down and just try and do your thing, sometimes magic happens.","Dub and reggae... I play that a lot around the house.","I love seeing the fans of the music that I make.","When I first began to write, I was writing on bass, because I was thinking more Public Image, more dub.","I love playing live, I don't like studios all that much. I need the reaction of the audience.","Playing live, you can't survive, certainly not in England. We used to work daytime jobs and play gigs at night. It was very exhausting.","We recorded our first CD, Sixteen Stone, with a small budget and never dreamed that we would enjoy such a high success. It was simply fantastic.","The Beatles, the Small Faces and the Kinks were great bands, but that was in the '60s.","Only the guys who never made it and will never make it in the U.S. need to put up the front that they don't care about America.","I pretty much grew up when punk was big in the UK. The Sex Pistols were heroes for me. I used to run around like Johnny Rotten. I had a jacket like his.","I think people are too hard on the Pistols. The Pistols started the whole punk thing and never saw much money.","I was pretty taken with Patti Smith, she was my heroine.","Lyrics are really important for me.","Bob Dylan has a way with words that simply blows me away. When he forgets his lyrics he just makes up new ones on the spot, that is what I called talented!","I am really addicted to music.","I don't see myself as the boss. I sing and write the songs, and it would feel strange if somebody else wrote the lyrics I sang.","In a band that works out well, everybody has a certain role to fulfill.","For the sound we produce, everybody is equally important. Each of us has a very different personality and that is what keeps Bush alive."],"Gavrilo Princip":["I am the son of peasants and I know what is happening in the villages. That is why I wanted to take revenge, and I regret nothing.","I aimed at the Archduke. I do not remember what I thought at that moment.","I only know that I fired twice, or perhaps several times, without knowing whether I had hit or missed."],"Gavyn Davies":["Normally I would not recommend a book that tells you how to make money in the stock market. Most of these books are aimed at gullible folk, and they usually make much more money for their authors than they do for the investing public.","There is an honourable tradition in British public life that those charged with authority at the top of an organisation should accept responsibility for what happens in that organisation. I am therefore writing to the prime minister today to tender my resignation as chairman of the BBC.","As long as the appointment process is transparent and there is a broad mix of political views among the governors of the BBC, I think the public can feel confident that impartiality and independence are just as important to me as they have been to previous incumbents.","Almost everyone will find something in our services worth paying for.","I want the BBC to be a mass market public service broadcaster still funded by the licence fee... and the licence fee is more durable than many people in the commercial sector believe.","It was an interesting question as to whether the BBC had a future in the digital world, and what form of market failure could justify the licence fee system.","Other than marriage, she doesn't control me and I don't control her.","Over the last decade, economists seemed to share a broad consensus about economic policy, with the old splits between monetarists and Keynesians apparently being settled by events. But the Great Recession of the last two years has changed everything.","Inflation is not always the main problem, or indeed a problem at all. Sometimes, though rarely, deflation is a more serious threat, and we need to shelve many of the orthodoxies we have held so dear.","The BBC should not have a cheerleader. It should have somebody who runs the organisation in the interests of the public and that should be a chairman.","The BBC must never be all about ratings - or even mainly about ratings. In the past year, we have made a raft of terrific programmes which stand comparison with the best the BBC has ever done: 'Blue Planet,' 'Walking with Beasts,' 'Son of God,' 'Clocking Off,' 'The Way We Live Now,' 'Conspiracy,' 'Lost World.'","The BBC is part of the glue which binds the United Kingdom together. At those times of national moment - of joy or sadness, in the UK or around the world, at times when the nation wants to celebrate, mourn or just enjoy itself people turn to the BBC.","Without the BBC, the proliferation of television and radio channels by the private sector would simply result in more and more channels, with tiny audiences, all seeking to do the same thing. The future would be one of fragmentation - fragmentation without either plurality or diversity.","The BBC provides the commentary on our lives, the soundtrack of the nation. It is one of the most powerful unifying forces in the United Kingdom today."],"Gay Talese":["With all of the qualities of the scene-setting, the dialogue, the place and time and the time and place in which your characters move. And I want to move with the characters, move with them and describe the world in which they are living.","The real problem is what to do with the problem-solvers after the problems are solved.","I could come up with 50 stories that I am thinking about.","For example, many colleges in their writing programs teach some of my work.","I write and rewrite and rewrite and write and like to turn in what I think is finished work.","News, if unreported, has no impact. It might as well have not happened at all.","Even after they had stopped modeling for Playboy and had settled down with other men to raise families of their own, Hugh Hefner still considered them his women, and in the bound volumes of his magazine he would always possess them.","The reporter wrote with the hope that he would get a by-line in the Times, a testimony to his being alive on that day and all the tomorrows of microfilm.","Restaurants are a wonderful escape for me. And are for a lot of people.","People go to restaurants for so many different reasons. To court a girl, to make some deal. Maybe to talk to some lawyer about how to get an alimony settlement better than they got last week.","Better that you should take the chance of trying something that is close to your heart, you think is what you want to write, and if they do not publish it, put it in your drawer. But maybe another day will come and you will find a place to put that.","I am writing about people who are alive in the city of New York during mid-20th-century America. And these people are like a character in a play or they are figures in a short story or a novel.","Yes there is a little group of soccer aficionados, but I am not one of them.","Thirteen years I took on this last book."],"Gayle Forman":["Oftentimes when you see adaptations of books you like, you're let down. As an author, you assume that they are going to suck. A little bit of hope is dangerous.","I can't pretend to be a teenager, but I feel like I never really stopped being a teenager.","Many of depression's symptoms - exhaustion, insomnia, nausea, headaches, weight loss, weight gain - are physical ailments.","After graduation, I wanted to work for 'Sassy', which I loved, but it had folded. So I wound up at 'Seventeen' for three years on staff and two as a contributor, and I wrote these great stories that nobody ever believes 'Seventeen' does. Serious stories for teens about social justice issues - gun control, migrant farm workers.","I think every teenager feels like a Martian in something, whether it's in their family, I think, or in their school. I think every teenager, every human being has a sense that they don't belong somewhere.","I didn't even start college until I was 21.","I don't know if I actually am good at the sight of blood. An accident on the street gets me very, very upset.","I think traveling made me who I am. When I was 16, I was an exchange student in England, and that was the year that I kind of feel like I was on the road going one direction in life, and it just kind of shifted me over, and I finished high school, and I went traveling for three more years instead of going to college.","It's not that we like sad movies that make us feel like, 'Oh, my God, what a bummer.' We like emotionally moving experiences. It's nothing new. It's catharsis. It goes back to the Greeks.","We like movies and books that give us this emotionally moving experience, where you feel like a slightly different person, and you see the world a little different after you finish. It lets you see your own life in a different way, and it actually makes you feel really good.","I wasn't one of those kids who grew up wanting to write or who read a particular book and thought: 'I want to do that!' I always told stories and wrote them down, but I never thought writing was a career path, even though, clearly, someone was writing the books and newspapers and magazines.","So, I guess motherhood and the threat of not being able to pay my rent inspired me to be a novelist. But as far as what inspired me to be a writer, it's the stories. It sounds very cliched, but the stories rise up and demand to be told. They always have done, long before I became a writer.","When I was really young, I wanted to grow up and be the sun. Which shows an early penchant for ambition or narcissism or grandiosity or delusion - all of which are bellwethers for becoming a writer.","As an author, I really hate a reader like me. There's no loyalty.","A good fight scene is really a good love scene.","Most writers have no idea how to make a film. It's a totally different skill set. Nor is it just to translate exactly what's on the page directly on to the screen - because that would be terrible. It would be five hours long, and the structure would be a mess. But the writers know the characters and the story.","People often call 'If I Stay' my baby novel, and I have to correct them. It's not my first book. It's just the first one anybody paid attention to.","My first YA novel, not many people have read. It's a fickle business. There's a degree of timing and luck involved.","John Green was on the set of 'The Fault In Our Stars' the entire time, which is amazing! Wouldn't you want John Green on set the entire time?","I have written a picture book that is based on my daughters. You know, my youngest one likes to tell everybody, 'Mommy wrote 'Best Day Ever' about us.' Which is true.","As we get older, we tend to think it is less OK to be vulnerable and to feel what we feel. It's kind of bull. We all still feel things pretty deeply. It just becomes less socially acceptable to express that.","I like to relate to my kids as they are. I enjoy spending that time with them. I see that my girls are so completely different and different from me, too.","In order that people who suffer from depression seek treatment without a second thought, the stigmas must further fall until we reach a point in time when that person with leukemia and that person with depression both receive the same level of sympathy and the same level of rigorous treatment. Both people deserve it.","Most of us have days or weeks or months so awful, we wish we'd never been born.","If the spectrum linking everyday depression to Major Depression sometimes hinders understanding of it, it also offers an opportunity for empathy. Because almost everyone, at some point, experiences feelings of sadness, of hopelessness, of emptiness, not to mention lethargy and irritability.","I think the phrase that resonates from 'Just One Year' is something I sort of live by: 'The truth and its opposite are flip sides of the same coin.'","I don't think I tell stories of tragedy. I think I tell stories of love. Even though you're full of tears, I hope that you leave the theatre with your heart feeling like it's going to explode out of your chest. And yes, you've been through the tragedy, but it's ultimately hope that I think you're left with.","My husband is a former rocker and in charge of our humungous music collection, and I've recently been asking him for classical music.","I will go running when I'm stressed out. The running helps, but more than anything, I'll put music on and then I'll run. I'll cry and get it all out.","I don't have a lot of men in my life. I'm married, but I have daughters. I'm surrounded by a lot of females in my world.","I wrote my first novel when my daughter was about six months old.","I love being a mom. But there's a certain kind of tedium to your life when your kid is young. Writing allows you to wander when your kid is napping in a crib ten feet away. So that's the great joy of writing fiction for me.","Experience has shown me that standing by oneself reading from one's book isn't especially compelling - unless you're David Sedaris.","I've found that the most engaging and satisfying author events I've done are with other people, where the conversation is spontaneous. I think that is by far the better way to introduce and promote a book.","'Twilight' is a breathlessly addictive read with a love story that sucks people in.","People have told me that they cannot put down 'If I Stay' after reading it, and readers have become very invested in the love story between Adam and Mia."],"Gayle Gardner":["In the end, I think you really only get as far as you're allowed to get.","If someone says you're a reporter and doesn't want you to anchor then you wonder why you worked so hard at it."],"Gayle King":["I'm basically a really happy person. My life is nuts, but it feels complete.","I'll do almost anything for cake - even trample little children!","I only tweet if I discover something that's fantastic, or if I heard something really great.","I know that Oprah and I mean a lot to each other... I know at all times I have somebody that I can count on always.","We're all spending way too much of our time and energy trying to fight the stuff we can't change.","Any film featuring Bradley Cooper's gorgeous blue eyes is automatically on my must-see list and they did not disappoint in 'The Words,' which is so intense and confusing that I was pretty lost by the end!","I love a man who loves his mama, which is one of the many reasons I'm crazy about Justin Timberlake.","I have an impressionable palate. A well-worded menu or beautifully presented dish excites me. I get a great deal of pleasure just thinking about food.","I normally don't love green juices, but Body & Eden makes theirs tasty by blending ingredients like avocado and banana with the usual suspects like kale and spinach. Delicious as they are, they're low calorie, and the drink names are catchy: I Have Balance, I Have Energy, and my favorite, I Have Calm.","I have to admit, if Oprah were a man, I would marry her.","So people ask, 'But how can you work for a friend?' I say it's because I know that the magazine is called 'O.' The bottom line is somebody has to have the final word. Oprah's not right all the time, but her record is pretty damn good. That's not to say you can't disagree.","All Oprah needs is a good book. My only request when she's building any house is, 'Could I please have a TV in my bedroom?'","I grew up in an all-white community.","I wish I wasn't so technically challenged, because it puts you at a distinct disadvantage. I wish I could figure out a way to get more up to speed.","People respond faster to you on a text than an e-mail. Why is that? Why will they ignore an e-mail, but get back to a text?","I wish there was something where you could blink an eye and be somewhere. I'm a very nervous flier. I wish we could get from point A to point B instantly.","I changed my name from Gail to Gayle in seventh grade because I liked to make a loopy 'y.'","I'm the oldest of three girls. My sisters say I can be bossy.","When I want to support a film starring actors I like, I purchase several tickets at the box office - even if I can't stay for the movie.","I majored in psychology, and I still love listening to people's problems.","No show can be 'The Oprah Winfrey Show,' including 'The Gayle King Show.' I think she's very good but I think I'm very good too. I think we have different skill sets... but I don't think that I could do what she does and never have.","I know for sure that nothing is guaranteed. Life always changes. I know for sure that I'm open to all possibilities always... let's just say my life is never boring.","People think that I don't work, and I fly around in Oprah's private plane doing whatever I want.","I'm thinking when I meet the right person - and I do believe that I will - he's going to be younger. Not cougar territory, though. I won't go out with someone who could be my son!","Sometimes you have to listen to a CD over and over before you really get it, but as soon as I heard the first note of R&B artist Chrisette Michele's debut CD, I was blown away. Her voice is playful but pretty, light but strong - the woman's got soul.","I consider myself lucky that Sheila Johnson, the cofounder of Black Entertainment Television, didn't choose to rest on her very impressive business laurels. Her luscious 100 percent modal scarves, printed with photos she takes all over the world, are gorgeous. Wearing one is like being wrapped in a hug.","The first time I met Beyonce she was about 18 years old, sitting in a makeup chair eating fried chicken, and I knew it was only a matter of time before everyone would know her name.","How do I love Tim McGraw? Let me count the ways: I love that he's a country boy with a city sensibility. I love that he refuses to be pegged, and his duet with Nelly proves it. And I really love that he had the brains to marry Faith Hill.","I can't stop watching 'Pan Am.' When I was growing up, my father worked as an engineer in Turkey, and we always flew Pan Am. The stewardesses were so glamorous! When they gave me a set of those golden wings, I felt very grown-up. Not only is the show's plot full of mystery and infidelity, they get the period details just right.","Boots in January are always a good look, and some of the cutest ones I've seen lately were designed by Ivanka Trump, who knows a thing or two about style.","My first memory of the Rolling Stones is listening to 'Satisfaction' at a sixth-grade slumber party at a friend's house in Ankara, Turkey, where my family was living at the time. In the middle of our sleepover, my friend's dad stopped the record when he heard the words 'girlie action!'","I know exercise is important, but I hate it!","One of the best parts of working at 'O' is that people just love to send us stuff.","I'll always remember when I bumped into Good Morning America's Robin Roberts on a flight to my mother's funeral in 1994, and how kind she was during that difficult time.","When I found out I was going to be on CBS every morning, my first phone call was to Jenny Craig. Ten days later, I'd lost nine pounds. Now I even take the plan's popcorn with me to the movies.","There's a science to ordering potatoes. Are they skinny shoestring or big, fat steak fries? You just have to let your taste buds guide you when deciding what to eat.","And, I believe that one of the most loving things you can do is prepare a meal for someone you love. None of which I know how to do!","I would love to have dinner with Jay-Z and Beyonce. I think we would have a lot to chat about. I like them both so much, and I love them as a couple. I like that they are both at the top of their game - and that they have a mutual respect and admiration for each other.","A good restaurant just makes me giddy. I can go all day with anticipation just knowing where I'm going to eat. Sometimes it's well planned, sometimes it's spontaneous. Either way works."],"Gayle Lynds":["You don't want to become guilty of plagiarism by letting someone else's words get inadvertently mixed in with your own. If you do feel the need to paste in a block of research while you're writing, be sure to highlight the copied text in a different color so you can go back and remove or rewrite it entirely later.","Ignorance is bliss, or so we're told. Personally, I find ignorance is also destiny.","'Mosaic' is about what we see and what we don't see. I learned how people can develop other senses to compensate for a missing one when I was a child. My best friend, Carol, who is profoundly deaf, saved me from an approaching car that she 'heard' when I didn't.","For a decade, I was a stay-at-home mom. I sent my husband to his law office, sat on PTA boards and baked cookies - great cookies. All of a sudden, I had no husband, no job, few prospects, and two small children who had grown accustomed to eating.","Get in the habit of vetting your research as you go - particularly research conducted online. Verify facts from multiple reputable sources before you record them.","Pulp paperbacks have always provided a training ground for men, Some of them went on to become respected authors - Dean Koontz, Nelson DeMille and Martin Cruz Smith, for example. Why couldn't a woman?","Writers sometimes ruin a book by adding a lighthearted mood at the wrong moment.","You don't have to resolve every problem of the book at the end, but you do have to resolve some.","Use plot to buttress a story.","Be wary of cutting and pasting research nuggets directly into your manuscript.","I've always looked upon research as an opportunity to satisfy my curiosity. But the other side of the coin is one must not be so caught up in it that one never gets the book written.","In 1996, when my first novel, 'Masquerade,' was published, I knew international thrillers - or spy novels, if you prefer - had been the domain of male authors for decades.","Our only solace as writers is in the work itself, and perhaps also in a penchant for blissful ignorance that allows us to gamble, to risk, to keep going where others would tote up the odds and stop.","Sometimes you get what you want not because it's right or fair or even smart, but because you just don't know any better.","If you're not in the hands of an expert editor, you really can go wrong in a lot of different ways.","If you are writing a thriller with violence in it, the ending must be violent. You are delivering a promise to your reader.","Do you love this story? If you love it, then you've got to write it.","The villain drives the plot.","I've seen unpublished manuscripts where the writer doesn't know they are making fun of the villain - but they are. If you aren't afraid of your villain, how can your hero be afraid?","Look realistically at espionage thrillers again. They're not only alive, readers are excited about them.","I've always loved spy stories. Who can resist?","The common wisdom is that only about 1 percent of a novelist's research ends up in his or her book. In my experience, it's even less - closer to a tenth of a percent."],"Gayle Rankin":["I always get compared to looking like a silent movie star - though I don't know if that's a compliment, honestly.","I had a ridiculously idyllic childhood. I think back and am like, 'Wow. I was so naive, in the best way.'","When I've known something is right, the actual doing of it is not scary. It's like being onstage or performing. After it and before it, there might be a lot of fear, but the act of it is never scary for me.","I sometimes get starstruck when I meet people who I didn't necessarily know what they look like, like directors or DPs, if I'm a huge fan of theirs.","If you put me in a box, I'm a character actor. The thing that keeps popping up for me - it sounds really cliche - but I want to play something really physically challenging, something extremely demanding and strong.","All of my characters, I feel, have some essence of who I am in them.","I can swing widely in both directions of helpful or not.","There's a misconception about wrestling, that it's really fake, but it's real, and you can really get hurt, even though a lot of it is performative.","I could legitimately put someone in a headlock, for sure.","I went to school at Juilliard, and most of our training there is the classics, and as much as I thrive in contemporary, weird, experimental work, I really am excited about finding a pioneer woman or something from a different era that I could really sink my teeth into.","I was a really girly girl when I was younger. I only wore pink until I was at least 12. Think of me in culottes with a Bagpuss T-shirt and frizzy hair. Oh, and I was a fat child. It was bad news.","'Calamity Jane' inspired me to be a performer. I still want to be her.","Naivete is the real reason I applied to Juilliard. I wanted to study drama and not musical theater because I have a hard time dancing. I only applied there.","I didn't think I was right for 'Cabaret'.","I've always wanted to perform and act my whole life and to understand people more, so that's the only reason I've got to work with the people I've worked with.","I just feel lucky to have had my training at Juilliard. Even though it is a 'classical' training programme, they also prepare you for all mediums. They don't teach specific techniques or subscribe to a specific school of thought about acting.","I fell in love with it after going there on holiday when I was 16: we went on one of those red bus tours, and it goes past Juilliard, and I was like, 'I want to go there'.","I was never interested in 'making up' games when I was little. I wanted to create something real.","I would ask my mum to feed my dolls and make sure they were tucked in when I went to school.","I spent the first 16 years of my life in Scotland. My whole family is there. It's in my blood and informs my sense of humour, my point of view, the people I choose to spend time with, everything.","There is magic in Scotland. It's country with a lot of pride and bravery. I feel lucky to have been born into that."],"Gayle Tzemach Lemmon":["The lessons I learned from my mother and her friends have guided me through death, birth, loss, love, failure, and achievement, on to a Fulbright scholarship and Harvard Business School. They taught me to believe that anything was possible. They have proven to be the strongest family values I could ever have imagined.","In reality, Afghanistan has functioned as a nation-state for more than two centuries, and its army and bureaucracy reach back to the 19th century.","We do not invest in victims, we invest in survivors.","What I learned at journalism school and at ABC - those skills are the same no matter where you are in the world.","In Afghanistan, life is so fragile; who knows what the next week will bring? That fragility really affects the way you're able to report, and the kind of stories people will tell you.","I think for larger-scale entrepreneurship, it's true - for men and women - that people who already have capital tend to do better.","I think entrepreneurs are born and not created, and so I think you see a lot of similarities among entrepreneurs in different parts of the world. Their backdrop may be very different, but their drive to create a business and to create jobs remains very much the same, whether it's in Silicon Valley or Kandahar or Kabul.","I think that sometimes people are frightened to take the risk of entrepreneurship.","The one thing you learn from looking at places like Afghanistan is that the power of business to do good is enormous.","Entrepreneurship isn't for everyone, and not everyone is going to be an entrepreneur, but women who turn to business, turn to economics, because there are people depending on them, I think that their creativity, their resilience, their spirit, embody what's best about entrepreneurship.","A social entrepreneur finds market-based solutions for change. Because without a market-based solution, without a sustainable solution, you go nowhere.","We are so used to seeing women as victims of war to be pitied rather than survivors of war to be respected.","When people can't feed their children, nothing else positive happens. You don't have to look farther than the United States to see that.","I worked at ABCNews.com at a time when nobody knew what 'dot com' was.","I don't often think of Donald Trump, but his daughter is very smart. She's a woman working in real estate, which is predominantly men, and she's both savvy and articulate about her business and her business acumen.","I'm a really bad driver. When I'm in L.A. my husband always has to park the car for me, because I'm likely to hit something.","Because microfinance is so manageable in terms of the size of the loan, people have made it the cornerstone to lifting women out of poverty.","Microfinance does not require previous experience or loans to the same extent as a small-business loan, so it's easier for women to enter the micro sector.","No woman in Afghanistan is in business without support from either her husband or her father or her uncle, someone.","The draconian prohibitions of the Taliban years and the gains Afghan women have achieved since the Taliban government was overthrown in 2001 are now well known and often cited: Today, Afghans lucky enough to live in secure regions can go to school, women may work in offices, and the burqa is no longer mandatory.","When the Taliban captured Kabul in 1996 after a searing, four-year civil war, they immediately instituted laws which fit their utopic vision of the time of Islam's founding more than 1,300 years earlier. Afghan women's lives offered the most visible sign of the imagined past to which Afghanistan's present was to be returned.","The women of Afghanistan have a voice, and it needs to be heard and not forgotten.","My mother worked at the telephone company during the day and sold Tupperware at night. Evenings, she took classes when she could at University of Maryland's University College, bringing me along to do homework while she studied to get the degree she hoped would offer her and me greater opportunities.","My mother never asked me whether I wanted to go to college, but told me I was going - to the University of Maryland on an academic scholarship.","Educating girls just one year beyond the average fourth grade education increases their eventual earnings by 10 to 20 percent. Every additional year of secondary education can increase future wages by 15 to 25 percent.","Educated mothers are 50 percent more likely to immunize their children than mothers with no schooling.","In Nigeria, along with its West African neighbor Ghana, women are now starting businesses in greater numbers than men.","It is high time to declare an end to the breastfeeding dictatorship that is drowning women in guilt and worry just when they most need support: after the birth of a child.","No one argues with the many benefits of breastfeeding for those women who choose it.","Women who choose to breastfeed should get as much education and support as possible.","War reporters are often seen as a wild bunch of thrill-seekers who wade into danger zones simply for the sake of the adrenalin high the settings inevitably provide. But this one-dimensional explanation leaves out the core of the story, which is that reporters go to these places because they feel the tug of responsibility.","Women in Afghanistan do not ask the United States to stay for the simple or sentimental reason of safeguarding their rights. They are the first ones to say that this is not enough of a reason for the world's remaining superpower to remain in their country.","The majority of Afghans do not see the Americans as foreign occupiers who must be defeated. Instead, they are hungry for the Americans to step up and help them make their country safer, their government cleaner and their economy stronger. They are disappointed because the international community has done too little, not too much.","Certainly Afghans in general and women in particular want a country in which security is a daily reality rather than a campaign slogan or the focus of drive-by speeches from diplomats dropping in for the day.","Giving birth to a baby does not make you an infant.","Single mothers are raising more of America's children than ever before.","Numerically speaking, half the population cannot be a minority. Yet when it comes to women, the numbers plainly show that the mathematically impossible is the socially acceptable.","It matters whether women sit at the table. No one speaks up for you when you are standing outside with your nose pressed up against the glass. You cannot window-shop for power.","A lot has been said about single mothers. Most of it has been less than flattering.","In Tunisia, where women have long enjoyed greater rights than many of their Arab neighbors, women pushed for and won a new electoral code that guarantees women will make up half of a candidates' list for office.","The military alone cannot end the conflict in Afghanistan. On that much nearly everyone can agree, offering a rare island of consensus among sides otherwise divided on the question of how and when America's longest-ever war should wind down.","The United States will not be in Afghanistan forever."],"Gaylord Nelson":["Loads of chemicals and hazardous wastes have been introduced into the atmosphere that didn't even exist in 1948. The environmental condition of the planet is far worse than it was 42 years ago.","The most important environmental issue is one that is rarely mentioned, and that is the lack of a conservation ethic in our culture.","We must recognize that we're all part of a web of life around the world. Anytime you extinguish a species, the consequences are serious.","If we continue to address the issue of the environment where we live as though we're the only species that lives here, we'll create a disaster for ourselves.","In the state of Wisconsin it's mandated that teachers in the social sciences and hard sciences have to start giving environmental education by the first grade, through high school.","Teddy Roosevelt of course was a great outdoorsman all his life.","The issues are by some geometric number - 100 or 200 or 500 - times more complicated today than we appreciated them to be when Franklin Roosevelt was around.","Franklin Roosevelt was very concerned about environmental issues.","I think the internal combustion engine will disappear from the streets of our cities in the next thirty years because transportation will be mass transportation, or probably electrical power."],"Gaylord Perry":["Going back down to the minors is the toughest thing to handle in baseball.","I'd always have grease in at least two places, in case the umpires would ask me to wipe one off. I never wanted to be caught out there with anything though, it wouldn't be professional.","The trouble with baseball is that it is not played the year round.","I reckon I tried everything on the old apple, but salt and pepper and chocolate sauce topping.","There is a difference between jaywalking and grand larceny."],"Gbenga Akinnagbe":["Don't hesitate or talk about what you want to do. Just do it.","The company Liberated People represents just not liberation of different nations around the world; it can be special liberation days. It can be what the company represents and helps highlight someone's personal liberation date.","Me personally, I like to wear as few artificially made products as possible. That stuff affects us, one way or another.","I don't need to be someone famous or George Clooney. I don't need to be any of these people to get involved in my community or reach out to one nationally.","I want to work with non-profits that stimulate growth to the community. Whether it is economic growth, intellectual, or freedom.","My grandmother was a Muslim. My mother is Christian. And I don't know what I am, but I believe in God.","Even if there isn't a God, I believe in the one we've created.","'The Wire' was a combination of great TV and great theater.","When I was younger, I won a radio at a church raffle.","If the project has good writing and is something I get excited about, then I'll do the role. And if it's for TV, I'll ask myself, 'Is it a show that I'd watch?' If it's a play or movie, I'll want to know if there's a good director attached.","Growing up, I was in and out of trouble in group homes and other institutions, and when I was 14, I was locked up in a psychiatric hospital for a number of months for behavioral problems.","Whether it's someone struggling with mental illness, someone struggling with poverty or struggling with their own limitations in their social behaviors, for some reason, I'm drawn to characters like that.","I'm a very physical person. I'm very tactile. I wrestled in college, so a lot of my communication with the world comes through physicality - what I take in and what I put out there.","You want a place where you can say that this is your show that you invested in with other actors, but there's also that flexibility of being a recurring actor.","'Home' may be the best part and best movie I've ever had. I loved it.","I like writing, and I enjoy it. It's painful. You can't get around the pain of writing. I'm still trying to balance on what I think is my creative habit. It varies, but I do know that I need to continue. It helps me with my acting, and the writing helps me be invested in a different way.","I did a movie called 'The Savages' with Laura Linney and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, where I played a nurse, and it showed me in a different role from what I played on 'The Wire.' It showed my range as an actor."],"Gedde Watanabe":["I still feel like there are a lot of things in me that people haven't seen. My soul hasn't been bared yet.","Yeah, I went to ACT for a while. It was great.","There's something in the moment when you can make them laugh or cry and show and incredibly compassionate side of life. I find that a really exemplary way to live.","Look at television and how comparatively few minorities are out there.","It's the most extraordinary and saddest thing, the amount of talent out there not being seen.","I've got a big mole on my butt. It's true.","I've been just like any other working actor, out there looking for stuff.","I'm going bald. I'm having a major problem with it.","I want to direct. It's something that I know I'll be really good at.","I used to be a street singer in San Francisco.","I did a film a long time ago with a shaved head and I had the ugliest looking head in the world.","Back in the 60s, San Francisco artists lived in communes."],"Geddy Lee":["For me, there is a lot of room for improvement and there are a lot of things I would like to be better at.","I think, basically, the music industry is scattered and in a mess. I think you've got lots of people that are so-called 'experts' that have no idea where it's headed.","I think jamming is the way we begin to communicate. In the old days, people actually wrote notes on paper and sent them to each other. I guess that's how they jammed.","My studio is designed for atmosphere. I have a really cozy, comfortable room that has a great, huge glass door that views my backyard.","Playing live is such a total visceral experience, and really, as a musician, you're trained from the beginning to be a live performer.","For me, how I feel about what I wrote down turns into a song.","I have a lot of hobbies and I can be very remiss in reminding myself to go down to the basement to work.","Live records of mine are very painful to listen to because you always think you can do it better. I don't think I have a single favorite one.","Rock and Roll does have its limits as far as the aging process. You want to go out there and play while you're at your peak, right? I think that's encouraging us to keep going out on the road - to maximize the playing at the moment.","I guess, we were people who just dedicated to trying to get better.","I have such an extreme attitude about work, where I can just completely be derelict of my responsibilities and then when I am not derelict, I am completely indulged in it. I swing pretty wildly from the two extremes.","But, I would be naive not to recognize the number of musicians who tell me they have been influenced by me and sight me - as well as Alex and Neil - as a musician who has been a positive influence on their playing.","First of all, when you live in a country like Canada, it's quite different from America in the sense that it's very tied to traditions that were born in Britain.","I am moved more by melodies, song structure, and evocative textures.","I do love using keyboards and I love writing keyboard parts, but I am not a player in the true sense of the word.","I feel a little uncomfortable about endorsements.","I feel safe and comfortable to do that once I know that the song structure around the bass part is very interesting and it satisfies me in a compositional sense.","I have always felt I was more accurately a Hard Rock musician.","I like to be able to come and go as I please, and I don't really like having my face and name plastered around. I think it's a bit weird to have your name plastered on every page in a magazine, where in each case you're using a different piece of equipment.","I like to practice on the bass, but I don't do it as often as I should.","I liked the fact that I was forced to get inside of my emotions and to really try to figure out a lot of what I was going through.","I love to write. It's my first love.","I prefer to think of myself as a musician who is still learning and trying to do something every time out.","I was taking piano lessons with a very good piano instructor in Toronto, and I'm afraid due to my schedule and discipline, it kind of fell apart. One thing lead to another and I was unable to practice as much as I wanted to.","I would like to shift more into writing for and producing people.","I would like to think that Ben and myself have begun a partnership that will take us into different areas of music that we can continue to write, enjoy and keep me involved with music other then what I do with RUSH.","I'm a big believer of daylight in the studio.","If you have some magical chemistry that actually find the music you make compelling, that is a big bonus.","It's hard for me to just practice without writing something.","Music is all about wanting to be better at it.","So, I don't know what is going to happen when the CD comes out, how well it will sell, etc. But, from a personal point of view, it was a very worthwhile endeavor.","So, I really don't consider myself a fabulous keyboard player.","Some writing and production projects will be a great way to spend my elderly rock years.","Sometimes it's nice to have a song that can be taken more then one way, so it can be interpreted differently.","That is what intrigues me; songwriting and song structure and expression.","Then, once I have lyrics, being able to shape them around a song is nothing new for me, I've been doing that for 25 years. The soul searching part of it, the spontaneous part of it, that was, and remains, a really terrific process.","There was a time when fast playing and fretboard pyrotechnics on the bass were important to me and when I am recording a bass track, that is still very important to me.","When I do a take, I very often try things that I haven't planned to try to see if I can pull it off.","When I usually go to my studio to work, I start with something that is going to take two minutes just to put some idea down and the next thing I know, ten hours have gone by and my family is screaming at me because they want me to come up to have dinner with them.","With me, satisfaction is always very fleeting with our work. I always get a little restless with it.","With the help of modern technology, I can compose intricate keyboard parts and then I have to go back and learn them in order to perform them properly.","Music turned to digital, and suddenly you had the possibility to make things louder than loudest, which boggles the mind but it's true, and what you have are all kinds of different ways of distorting your music.","It's a battle between record company, between producer and between mastering engineer. Because the louder you make your record in a digital process, the more dynamics are squished out of it. Nobody knows exactly what happens, but the dynamics in the performance disappear, and everything is at the same volume.","It's very rare - and it does happen on occasion - where I'll take a piece of lyric and I'll just sit down and purposefully craft that melody around that lyric because I think the lyric is the wellspring for the song, without question.","My emotions are very simple and always have been about the Hall of Fame. It's something that I had absolutely nothing to do with and had no control over, so I never thought much about it, to be frank.","Something happens when you become an elder rock & roller and you're still functioning. People start to give you awards and recognize achievements. It's the life achievement period of your career.","You spend most of your life working and trying to hone your craft, working on your chops, working on your writing, and you don't really think about accolades. Then you get a bit older and they start coming your way. It's a nice pat on the back.","Live albums are very important for Rush, and they became sort of a closing chapter for us.","I worry about my voice 24/7 when I'm on tour. It's like a pitcher and his arm. It's constantly the thing that my whole life revolves around.","My diet, my regime, the whole life I have on the road has always got that little bit of stress because I'm always afraid I'm going to get a cold. And it's just such a nightmare when you got a cold or an irritation and you have to do a show.","Well, I've been lucky. I've never gotten a voice polyp. I've never gotten nodes. But I do get sick, usually every tour, and to varying degrees. Sometimes it's a sinusitis.","I think you just have to cross your fingers that there's enough artists out there that keep producing interesting work, and eventually it will form a kind of wave that will force people to pay attention to it.","Back in the day, fans wrote letters to groups - you'd get them, although it could take a while. Now, artists can go online and there's discussions about what you should and shouldn't be doing. The minute you announce that you're recording an album, thousands of people are telling you what that album should be.","If I start mining for opinions on hundreds of websites that have fan forums, I'll be totally distorted in my view of myself. I'll lose myself in all that.","The first song that made me interested in music was 'Oh, Pretty Woman' by Roy Orbison. It was the guitar intro, that riff, that I really liked and made me listen in a different way.","I can't remember the first song I learned to play on bass, but the first song I learned to play on guitar was 'For Your Love' by the Yardbirds. That kind of was the beginning for me. I thought it was a great song and I loved the open chord progression at the beginning of that song.","Certainly my personality, my sense of humor, my outlook on life was informed by the experiences of my parents and the stories they shared with me."],"Geena Davis":["I just read that 81 percent of Americans are ready to vote for a woman. So it sounds like America is ready.","Rosie knows how to play ball. She's an athlete, for sure.","If I go to hotels, they always say, 'Welcome back', even when I've never been there before.","I was really lucky that I had an aunt who was very inspiring to me. She was different than anybody in my family on either side.","I get the feeling that characters are written female when they have to be, and all the other characters are male, and it doesn't occur to somebody that the lawyer, the best friend, the landlord, whoever, can be female.","Women are half the population of the world, and yet there are so few female characters on-screen.","I never intended to become a data head. I could never have predicted it would play such an important role in my life. Yet here we are: My Institute on Gender in Media has sponsored the largest amount of research ever done on gender depictions in media, covering a 20-year-plus span.","Archery is something that I took up later and didn't know I had a natural aptitude for.","If you risk nothing, then you risk everything.","So many other countries have had female leaders, in fact the U.S. ranks 61st in female representation in government and I think it is startling and sign of a change that needs to be made.","I have an elbow that bends the wrong way, and I'd do things like stand in an elevator and the doors would close, and I'd pretend that my arm had got caught in it, and then I'd scream, 'Ow, ow, put it back!'","I have a Web site that parents and girls can use to learn about Title IX and take action if they find their school is not in compliance. Thirty years after Title IX passed, 80 percent of schools are not in compliance.","I haven't ever gone to any Mensa meetings.","Archers are pretty focused.","This dapper little mouse that wore such cute clothes and said such interesting things, yeah. I thought it was a great idea to have a mouse like that in your family, so now I get to see what it was like.","Something's like crossed over in me and I can't go back. I couldn't live.","It's a fantasy that we could have a president who could actually make choices based on what's right, rather than having to weigh the political fallout. But that's sort of what we're showing. And you can dream.","We're making this as entertainment. But God willing, if this show stays on and people see a woman in that office for a while, I think it will help people become more used to it. It's certainly about time that we had a few female presidents.","Somebody warned me early on to be very careful about brushing up against the chocolate.","As an Independent, she has no party backing... Her being the first Independent president trumps the fact that she's a woman. It causes even more upheaval in Washington than her being female.","A woman as the leader of the Free World is an impossibility. Muslim countries won't talk to you.","Look at the number of cop shows and lawyer shows and forensics shows... I think there could be room for two quite different examinations of the same political office.","I played this character twice in live action, and now I've become an animated character. It was actually fun to see myself drawn - I've never been a drawn character before.","When my friends and I would act out movies as kids, we'd play the guys' roles, since they had the most interesting things to do. Decades later, I can hardly believe my sons and daughter are seeing many of the same limited choices in current films.","It's really important for boys to see that girls take up half of the planet - which we do.","I've always looked up to him, even though he is shorter.","We're showing kids a world that is very scantily populated with women and female characters. They should see female characters taking up half the planet, which we do.","When I was first starting out was also when I first started really paying attention to the Oscars and stuff like that. And I remember thinking, 'Wow, everything is great for women in Hollywood, because Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, Jessica Lange, Sally Field - they're all doing incredible work.'","I am completely obsessed with numbers and data. I have become a scientist in later life.","I had one date in high school - that was it, and he didn't ask me out again, because I was taller than everybody. I was very gangly and awkward, and I wore weird clothes that I made.","Dressing up used to be more of a thing. My dad wore a suit always. Now you think, why bother?","I was once up for a part, and the male star was also producing the movie. They were talking about meeting with him or having an audition with him, and then we get the message, 'He wants to have dinner with you.' I said, 'Is that the audition, or is it that he just wants to have dinner with me?'","Having been in some roles that really resonated with women, I became hyper-aware of how women are represented in Hollywood.","I was averaging about one movie a year my whole career, and that was because I'm fussy. I probably could have done more.","The big takeaway I got from 'Thelma & Louise' was the reaction of women who had seen the movie being so profound, so different. It was overwhelming, and it made me realise how few opportunities we give women to feel excited and empowered by female characters, to come out of a movie pumped.","I remember when 'A League of Their Own' was coming out in '92, when I was doing interviews, it seemed like every interviewer at some point would say, 'So... would you consider this a feminist movie?' People are worried that it's a taboo thing, so I took great relish in saying, 'Yes, I would. Write that, yes.'","The motto of my institute has always been, 'If they can see it, they can be it.' And it's literally true. If we show something on-screen, it will change what happens in real life.","You can't snap your fingers, and suddenly half of Congress is women.","There are woefully few women CEOs in the world, but there can be lots of them in films.","How do we encourage a lot more girls to pursue science, technology, and engineering careers? By casting droves of women in STEM jobs today in movies and on TV.","What I didn't realize until much later, in hindsight, was I had subconsciously been choosing projects where the woman was in charge of her own destiny.","Identifying with a character is one of the best parts of seeing a movie, but as women, we've had to train ourselves to experience the male journey.","Film roles really did start to dry up when I got into my 40s.","One thing I always want to clear up was the notion that I 'took time off to have a baby.' A lot people leapt to that conclusion because becoming a parent happened to coincide with film roles tapering off.","Disney has proved without a shadow of a doubt that movies with a female lead work.","Certainly 'Wonder Woman' needed to be made, and I'm so beyond thrilled with how it came out. I met Patty Jenkins, and I told her, 'I'm sure you're going to make a sequel, and if you need anybody Amazonian, there's always me. I'm available.'","My parents are both from Vermont, very old-fashioned New England. We heated our house with wood my father chopped. My mom grew all of our food. We were very underexposed to everything."],"Geezer Butler":["It doesn't matter who you vote for. It's still the same billionaires that run the world.","If you polish things too much, it loses the feeling.","Without a doubt, Ozzy is the craziest person I've ever met. Son of Sam is a close second.","When you see all of these bands citing you as influences, it makes you feel relevant.","What I used to play was rhythm guitar before I saw Jack Bruce. I said, That's what I want to do in life. He was definitely the main influence.","We were into Hendrix and Cream, who were like the heaviest bands around at that time. We just wanted to be heavier than everybody else!","Toward the later days of Sabbath, instead of going in and knocking out what songs we did in rehearsal, we would polish them to death.","To me, Sabbath was always JUSt a really heavy blues band. That s all we were. We just took those blues roots and made them heavier.","To do the Ozzfest again would be great. I'd like to finish with a final Sabbath album. You always feel that it is still a challenge.","The Geezer album, Black Science, had a lot of keyboards and it did not work.","The '80s were the worst period. You had these horrible pop bands growing their hair and calling themselves metal.","Ozzy wanted to get us back together. It's been 20 years. We did a couple of songs during his farewell in 1992 and that got the ball rolling.","Lately, I've been listening to some jazz albums. I love the new Pat Metheny album. John Coltrane. I still like good metal, though!","Jack Bruce, as soon as I saw him, it changed me. I didn't even know what bass players did until I saw Cream.","It's totally produced now. It's almost like a conveyor belt of what metal's supposed to be like these days. It's not music to me.","It seems like the older bands are bigger than ever. We get a mixed crowd where you have kids and old blokes like me.","If you are a pop band, don't say you're a metal band. Poison and Warrant were about as metal as the Backstreet Boys.","I've been perfectly happily married for 25 years, and have a nice life. Inane things don't interest me.","I would not want to write something about something I do not think about.","I was so frustrated in Sabbath after the last few albums. I just didn't like the musical direction Sabbath was going in.","I never try and sound like Sabbath.","I never picked a bass up before Sabbath started.","I love soccer. That's all I ever watch. I'll watch it all day if I can. But I'm too bloody old to play now.","I like to deal in the reality of life. I'm too old to sing about women and things like that.","I don't feel a lack of hope. It's just disappointment that after all these years we're still fighting meaningless wars for a handful of people.","However long the song is was how long it took us to write it.","Black Sabbath was written on bass: I just walked into the studio and went, bah, bah, bah, and everybody joined in and we just did it."],"Geisha Williams":["I never thought of myself as a woman leader or Latina leader; I just thought of myself as a leader.","I'm the first person in my family to go to college, and I'm an immigrant. My aspirations coming out of college weren't particularly lofty. I wanted a good job with a good company.","I'd like to see a world where there are so many Latina women leaders - and women of all different backgrounds - in the top jobs around the country. When that happens, we've succeeded.","Don't be afraid to take the tough jobs. You'll develop confidence in dealing with tough issues that will serve you for the rest of your career.","I went from thinking I could be a manager to thinking I could do something much bigger than that.","We will never forget the lessons that we learned as a result of San Bruno. It's really caused us to focus on safety with a laser-like sort of manner. There's always more work to be done.","What I see with the utility industry is, more and more, we're taking up this belief that our workforce, our leadership ranks, our board should be reflective of the community that we serve.","Over the years, I really focused on doing the best job I could, working hard, getting great results, and working with my teams.","I've got revolutionary blood in my blood.","I liked helping my parents, feeling useful, feeling smart.","We're very committed... to make sure the energy that we are delivering to our customers is as clean as it can be.","I fell in love with electricity.","I realized I could work for a manufacturer or a hospital, or I could work for a company that enables the manufacturer, the hospital, and everything else.","You don't have to be in the power business to be a powerful woman.","When you understand your customer base, you have to provide them with what they want.","We have, here in California, among the most ambitious climate goals in the country. It's not just our political leaders or our regulators that really wants these things.","The people of California really like innovation.","We greatly value the contributions of all of our employees.","I am honored to have the opportunity to lead the extraordinary 23,000 employees of PG&E and to support their efforts to safely serve 16 million Californians.","California continues to lead the nation in the fight against climate change, and electrifying our transportation sector is the next game changer.","By expanding the state's EV infrastructure, PG&E is continuing to help California meet its climate goals while making it more convenient for our customers to choose clean, affordable electricity to fuel their vehicles."],"Gelett Burgess":["To appreciate nonsense requires a serious interest in life.","If in the last few years you haven't discarded a major opinion or acquired a new one, check your pulse. You may be dead."],"Gelila Bekele":["Modeling is not something you excel because you are clever but is based on physical appearance, but then you have to be a businesswoman, like, to keep your longevity.","I'm learning simplicity and how to wear my body. I'm enjoying life and trying to be the best me.","Life is a perspective and for me, if a human being has access to school, clean water, food, proper health care, that is the basis of human rights."],"Gelsey Kirkland":["The voices of moral authority in the theatre demanded only punctuality and physical performance. In the light of continuing pressure and stress, the occasional lip service paid to moderation was meaningless. Starvation and poisoning were not excesses, but measures taken to stay within the norm.","You've got to break through this idea of being light as a ballerina. The heavier you'll feel, the lighter you'll look.","Often, when you've reached a very high level of achievement, you almost become paralyzed by the idea that anything you might do might be imperfect. Perfection is just the striving, the effort, the struggle, but it's hard to remember that.","I danced with passion to spite the music.","At this stage of my life I would rather try and have some small impact within a company and suffer through those things than make such a big stink that nobody can trust to work with you. It's very important in an environment of a big institution that people don't feel threatened that you're going to expose them in any way.","There was a stage when Balanchine and I didn't talk. I was trying to develop my classical technique as opposed to the fast-track technique that he was pushing. We were very quiet with each other. But after two years he saw what I was doing and sent messages through other people that, yes, this is good.","As soon as you become afraid to make a fool of yourself, you're in trouble. I decided I may as well just see if I can live with myself making millions of mistakes and learn something from it.","The first year with ABT I learned 13 new roles. Most were lengthy ballets, more complicated than I was used to. I have suffered from tendinitis since I was 13, and it flared up again until the pain was paralyzing. There were times I prayed I'd be sick so I wouldn't have to go on.","I know my body. What happened is that I got so caught up in the applause I forgot how I should dance. All my life I've been what others wanted - in dancing and in life. Now I'm doing it my way."],"Gemma Arterton":["I was quite naughty at school.","I actually had a cockney accent before I went to drama school. It's softened up a bit.","My mother, she had a very good attitude toward money. I'm very grateful for the fact that we had to learn to save. I used to get like 50 pence a week, and I'd save it for like five months. And then I'd spend it on Christmas presents. I'd save up like eight pounds. It's nothing, but we did that.","I'm looking at working with people I get on with, that respect me, that don't just see me as a piece of ass. Which I have experienced as well. I've nearly walked off very big films before, and I would, because I don't want that in my life. I want to enjoy the work I do.","It's interesting for me to always make myself look very different.","When I watch myself in movies I go, 'My God.'","The industry is quite chauvinistic generally. Expectations of women, girls, what they should look like, how they should be, what they should say, what they should wear, how their hair should be, what colour their skin should be.","I don't know why it's still a taboo to be a feminist.","My family was never cultural in that we never went to see plays, my mum wasn't very into films.","It's such a male-dominated industry. You can be a feminist, it's just difficult because it sometimes comes back at you.","It's difficult for a young girl like me. Because there's a certain time for young actresses, which is like a really juicy period when all the parts are love interests and young heroines. Of course, there's always work for men whatever age they are.","My family are very down-to-earth people. We are not showbizzy at all.","I've never been to the opera; I've only seen opera on DVD.","I'm always listening to music; I can't live without it.","I wouldn't change a thing in my own life, but I'd like to go back in time anyway though, just to some sort of eras that I wish I'd lived in - like the '60s. I'd love to have been in London in the '60s, partying away.","I was born with lots of deformities.","I was born with six fingers on each hand.","Music is my biggest passion aside from anything else.","I was in lots of dodgy bands growing up and I always fancied myself in a band. But, you know, I was rubbish at writing music. So maybe one day I'll play a rock star, or punk rocker.","Never in my short career, I've never had that experience where I wasn't sure if I was acting or if it was real.","I've done about four deaths in films now, and I think it's quite good because then it's sort of a memorable moment in the film.","I don't want to be about the way I look - my body, my hair, my makeup, all those boring things.","I don't go out and go to parties and do all of that.","I probably should get a bit more star-struck but I never do.","Especially with girls, people always want to put them in little brackets.","I'm always surprised at what I actually end up doing because I don't have a strategy or a game plan, especially now that I'm making my own choices.","I love strange things; my favorite movies are weird, eclectic, and intriguing.","You can't connect with something you're not passionate about.","I am terrible at video games and I am really competitive. And if I am not the best at something, I go absolutely crazy!","I always thought I was going to end up an old spinster, with my cats and fur coats."],"Gemma Chan":["I was given a lot of homework: I had to practise ironing as a synth, practise washing up as a synth, cooking a meal as a synth. It's definitely the most prep I've had to do for a role.","I found a place under a bridge in Goa where you could have fresh crab and beer. It was nothing complicated, but delicious.","As a means to an end, modelling was good, but I had to distance myself from it when I started working as an actress, because even though I wasn't high-profile, I found in my first write-ups that I'd be referred to as 'model Gemma Chan.'","I ended up doing a local AmDram musical when I was nine or so. We had to sing and dance and act. It was probably terrible, but I loved it.","My parents are wonderful, practical, sensible people, and the expectation was that I would study something academic.","Making a pretty picture, an image, is a completely different thing from acting to camera.","I'm quite a rational person. I'm not very superstitious, but I really do enjoy horror as a genre.","Even though I don't necessarily believe in everything that's supernatural, I like being scared and I like things that are suspenseful.","As a human, you don't have to be too conscious of your movement. I think it's tougher playing a robot than a human, and even tougher playing a robot who begins showing traces of being a human.","Growing up, I never saw any Asian faces on TV, so it didn't feel like a viable option.","I've been fortunate in my career, but, yes, there have been many times when I have been told my audition has been cancelled because they're only going to see white people.","All of us have a lot of physical tics that we don't realize that we're doing subconsciously.","I visited a Child Friendly Space where children take part in structured play and development activities in a safe environment. These are designed to develop their cognitive ability as well as address their psychosocial needs. As I watched them sing songs and take part in games, it struck me that these kids could be anywhere in the world.","Save the Children is also working to improve accommodation for refugee families living outside settlements. I met a family which had been living in a substandard building without windows, doors or a toilet.","I do feel a responsibility to try and raise awareness and to help tell the stories of those who may not otherwise have a voice.","I've always admired the work that Save the Children does to improve the lives of children and their families all over the world.","It's really rare in TV not to think, 'Well, I've seen a version of this before.'","I know we've had AI films, but they've been quite specific in their scope. The scope of 'Humans' is a world set up where this technology is universally accepted. I haven't seen anything that's dealt with it in that multi-layered, every-layer-of-society way.","AI - not so some kind of far-off thing. It's part of our lives now, from your phone to everything you do. It makes our lives easier in a lot of ways.","When you think of things like medicine, people who have lost limbs now have a chance to have a limb replaced that is connected to the brain that they can actually control with their mind. That's amazing.","I think 'Humans' is more about provoking the idea that there is a class of beings in society that we treat as less than... as subordinates; people who we treat badly and take for granted. Often they are the same people who work hard to keep the city going. We need to think about that.","I hate the idea that people should listen to what actors have to say on certain issues more than anyone else. Actors have no more right to be heard than anyone.","I loathe exercise. And I hate gyms. I've never had a personal trainer.","My parents thought they were getting an accountant and a lawyer. Instead, they ended up with a PR and an actress.","I would have done it happily, but to be a Bond girl isn't everything I aim for as an actress.","From my experience, I would say no: actors of East Asian descent don't get the opportunities white actors do. I know that's inherently a problem in a country that produces a lot of period drama, but I have to fight so hard to get parts that don't have something to do with China.","I've heard about productions where it still happens: yellow face, taping up the eyes. It's hard to talk about it in a constructive way.","Italy - I love the late-night culture, hanging around the square at midnight with everyone, catching up and having a drink.","I avoid flying Ryanair if I can. I know that everyone gives them a hard time, but there's a good reason for that.","Getting stuck in a plane for four hours on the tarmac on the hottest day of summer in Italy - it was like being trapped in a boiling tin can."],"Gemma Jones":["As you get older, your idiosyncrasies become sort of exaggerated. So you are who you have always been, only more so.","My mother had Alzheimer's, and it's a desperately, desperately cruel thing to witness.","Even if your parents don't have Alzheimer's or aren't in a wheelchair, your parents get old - if you're lucky to have parents who live for a long time. It's a challenge, and it's difficult and lovely and touching and awful and ghastly and real.","Rather nostalgically, I sometimes think I could still play Juliet. Inside, I'm still an incorrigible romantic.","I'm lucky because I have never been pigeonholed and the roles have kept on coming.","I think it is very natural to want to be partnered, but you never know. you read about mature love affairs in the press, and it gives you hope. You think: 'Well, it's not impossible.'","Walking is my hobby, and I'm lucky that I live right on the edge of Hampstead Heath.","I don't colour my hair, and I look like the back end of a bus, so I get asked to play old people.","Young women are still looking for a prince on a white charger to come over the hill or for Mr. Rochester to appear. We all pretend we're right-on feminists, but underneath that, there's still the bedrock of romance.","I do enjoy filming, but I do consider myself still to be a bit of a novice, and I learn a bit every time I do a film job, and I am very admiring of film actors.","All the Shakespeare parts are for young women, mostly."],"Gemma Ward":["Some girls get swept up in the lifestyle - clubbing and partying with celebrities. You can't live your life like that, though. It's fake.","I think in terms of me shying away from modelling, I would like to clarify in some way that I was taking a break from many things in my life and obviously what people in the public see is that I'm pulling away from what is more public.","I've always admired Cate Blanchett and the roles she chooses. I think she's got an incredible discipline in a way, with choosing roles that are going to help her grow and bring something interesting to the world.","I realize you can't please everyone.","I have taken a break from the media spotlight for the past few years.","As a model you do play a certain role and you know as an actor you play another role.","Lots of models have played mermaids throughout history and it is, kind of, a funny rite of passage.","I never really cared about what I looked like.","I got on stage for the first time when I was seven. From seven until I was about nine it was probably more to do with just being on stage and having the attention.","To make my brothers and my sister laugh was the greatest joy to me in my life. I like people who can make fun of themselves a lot.","I have a very, very creative family.","As a child, I was a clown. I didn't hesitate to make a fool of myself and I would love to completely take on wacky characters.","Through my whole career, that's been a major thing - bringing my family with me.","It's hard if you start believing that you should be really that perfect fantasy ideal, that people start believing because of all of the retouching. You can delve into that fantasy world and play with it, but when you walk away, that's not you.","I'm very aware of my spending, but I'm not very aware of my income. There are certain times when I speak to my accountant, or something will pop up, and I'll be like 'oh' but it's not really a frontrunner in my head."],"Gemma Whelan":["I'm more frightened than interested by artificial intelligence - in fact, perhaps fright and interest are not far away from one another. Things can become real in your mind, you can be tricked, and you believe things you wouldn't ordinarily. A world run by automatons doesn't seem completely unrealistic any more. It's a bit chilling.","Brilliant documentaries are about so much more than their subject.","We're losing touch with ourselves in the technological world, and it is increasingly important to take time out.","I can't always say that justice is always done in 'Game of Thrones.' It is not.","There's something really wonderful about making people laugh, and if you can find the laughs within a dramatic piece, it's also very rewarding."],"Gena Lee Nolin":["My children are the reason I laugh, smile and want to get up every morning.","My children teach me to slow down and enjoy life.","I want to work, but being a mom is my No. 1 priority.","I love a guy in a suit - someone who puts on his nice Armani pants.","I think Baywatch is such a hit here because of the weather.","Midwestern people stick together. Gee willikers, they work hard. There's no glitz, no glamour. When I was a girl in Duluth, Minnesota, I used to get up early and milk cows, so I know what hard work is."],"Gena Rowlands":["I can never have a poker face. Anybody looking at me can tell exactly what I'm thinking.","I always do make a back story for myself, but I'm not sure how necessary it is. I just like to.","The thing about acting is you don't want to let on how enjoyable it is or then everybody would want to become an actress. But it really is. It's a pleasure to go and exchange your identity.","People in independent film have a passion; they're not in it for the money.","I love independent filmmaking. I don't agree with a lot of it, but that's the point.","I like subtitles. Sometimes I wish all movies had subtitles.","But you base everything on people you know.","After you play a part, you think of it as your own."],"Gena Showalter":["My husband is actually the nicest guy in the world. He's my sweetheart and best friend, and one of the things I love best about him is that no matter how terrible I look - and believe me, it can get bad - he makes me feel pretty.","I just write the characters the way I see them. And maybe that's because I'm surrounded by the most amazing men,from my father to my husband to all of my brothers. They are true heroes!","'Wicked Nights' is the story of Zacharel, the new leader of the Army of Disgrace - heavenly warriors in danger of falling from grace - and Annabelle, a human who has spent the last four years locked in an institution for the criminally insane.","I'll usually see a scene in my head, playing like a movie trailer. After I've written that scene, everything takes off from there.","To be honest, I rewrote 'Wicked Nights' a number of times. I just wasn't happy with the end result.","The moment I finish 'any' book, my feels are pretty much the same. Goes a little something like this: It's done? Whimper. Tears of joy. Oh, my back. Relief! Shower! Food! Sleep! Oh, my back. You mean I get to catch up on my favorite TV shows? Tears of joy. Oh, my back.","I have been overwhelmed by the response to 'The Queen of Zombie Hearts.'","Last time I blushed was when I smoothed my hands over the back of my dress and actually touched skin. Seems the material was tucked into my underwear, and everyone around me had gotten a show. This, of course, was at a romance writers' conference.","Once I have the grain of an idea, it haunts me until I finish the story. I don't like to be haunted, of course, so immediately get to work.","I have so many favorite authors; I can't name just one."],"Gene Barry":["The attitude of the actor is his interpretation of what he reads, and the written word is what creates the role in the actor's mind, and I guess in reading the things that were given to me, I reacted as you guys saw me, you know.","I just wanted to be a guy who could earn a living as an actor, and I did that for a long time."],"Gene Clark":["Zen, per se, is not just an art, it's not just a religion, it's a realisation.","The actual writing of a song usually comes in the form of a realisation. I can't contrive a song."],"Gene Fowler":["What is success? It is a toy balloon among children armed with pins.","The best way to become a successful writer is to read good writing, remember it, and then forget where you remember it from.","Writing is easy: All you do is sit staring at a blank sheet of paper until drops of blood form on your forehead.","Men are not against you; they are merely for themselves.","Whatever one believes to be true either is true or becomes true in one's mind.","For books are more than books, they are the life, the very heart and core of ages past, the reason why men lived and worked and died, the essence and quintessence of their lives.","Everyone needs a warm personal enemy or two to keep him free from rust in the movable parts of his mind.","Never thank anybody for anything, except a drink of water in the desert - and then make it brief.","Love and memory last and will so endure till the game is called because of darkness.","He has a profound respect for old age. Especially when it's bottled.","Sometimes I think my writing sounds like I walked out of the room and left the typewriter running.","They that will not be counseled, cannot be helped. If you do not hear reason she will rap you on the knuckles.","It is easier to believe than to doubt.","I will be brief. Not nearly so brief as Salvador Dali, who gave the world's shortest speech. He said I will be so brief I have already finished, and he sat down.","Perhaps no mightier conflict of mind occurs ever again in a lifetime than that first decision to unseat one's own tooth.","Psychoanalysts seem to be long on information and short on application.","If they haven't heard it before it's original."],"Gene Green":["The Electoral College was necessary when communications were poor, literacy was low, and voters lacked information about out-of-state figures, which is clearly no longer the case.","Every citizen's vote should count in America, not just the votes of partisan insiders in the Electoral College.","More than 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does nationally is preventive care - including cervical cancer screenings, breast cancer screenings, and family planning - mostly for women with low resources and income below the poverty line.","E-waste is the fastest growing waste stream in the United States and can pose serious environmental and health problems here and around the world when not handled properly.","The Vietnam War soured President Johnson's legacy. We still have to recognize his domestic legacy.","If the EPA cannot or will not act to halt the toxic e-waste trade to developing nations, then Congress should take action.","You work really hard on something, and if you're lucky, you get a break.","The knee-jerk approach of those who want to control firearms may not be the solution.","I do have a lot of alumni in Washington.","Cap and trade is not an easy one for refiners, so we tried to get some moderation in the bill, and we did, but not near as much I would like.","People have the right to know the drugs they are taking will make them better instead of harming them.","Punishment for putting patients at risk ought to reflect the gravity of manufacturing, distributing or selling counterfeit medications.","The Hunting Bayou and Greens Bayou watersheds have experienced major flooding over the years and are crying out for investment to protect the hundreds of thousands of residents and businesses in those areas.","The Federal Communications Commission licensed satellite radio to be a national-only radio service.","I support the free enterprise system, and I want companies to make money, but they shouldn't be reaping profits from the deaths of their employees or former employees.","In some cases, corporations engaged in this activity have as much as 16 percent of their profits generated through the holding of 'janitor's insurance.'","Women who may choose to have silicone breast implants are entitled to independent research to ensure they have complete and comprehensive information. It's especially important since so many women have experienced complications with their implants they never knew were possible.","I have a lot of hard-working, blue-collar people in my district who are at the end of their unemployment benefits.","If you're not worried, you're not reasonable.","Sen. Clinton carried our district, and it is difficult to vote against your constituents.","It's no secret I was part of John Dingell's whip team.","As the pace of technology increases, the amount of toxic electronic waste is piling up at home and abroad.","Many Americans are unaware that discarded electronics often contain lead, mercury, and other toxins and end up being salvaged under inhumane conditions in the developing world.","What happened with Keystone is it actually poisoned the well for other pipelines that are not as controversial.","Floor time is valuable. Our leadership isn't going to bring something up that's going to take up floor time and not be successful.","The significant regulatory impact of reclassifying broadband services is not something that should be taken lightly and should not be done without additional direction from Congress.","There's a value in used electronic equipment, and currently, there are small, domestic recyclers that process this equipment safely. But they have a hard time competing with facilities overseas that have few, if any, environmental and safety standards.","What auto and steel is to Ohio River Valley, refineries are to the oil regions. You wouldn't tell Silicon Valley you're going to put a moratorium on high-tech.","We should not continue to play politics with women's health.","Instead of saying we need to outlaw certain types of weapons, we need to find better ways to enforce current law.","Some of my toughest races are people I've known, because it gets more personal than it should be.","You draw a district for that particular minority - African American, Asian, Hispanic - so those folks have the right to elect whoever they want. If they don't decide to elect someone who sounds like them or looks like them, they can pick anyone they want.","I think we've been the selection just because I think I've earned it by doing a lot of things for the district.","Having someone from Washington, California, or Chicago come in as a verifier, it shows the Hispanic community that Hispanic leaders support me.","I work closely with Hispanic leadership.","We have lots of students graduating from our high schools, and you import the labor, then we're not giving that opportunity to our own folks.","If you're going to do something to hurt the district I represent, I can't vote for it.","If we can't remove a member of Congress who has been convicted of 10 felonies - including using his office for personal gain - we risk losing the faith and trust of the American people that we have.","Whether it was the Alaskan pipeline disaster or the Texas City refinery fire where 15 people died, time after time it's been shown that BP chooses expediency over safety.","Shell and Exxon support export, but refiners like Valero could end up paying more for the crude oil.","I'm always running back and forth to the district.","I've been hearing from people saying they see me more than they do their city council member.","It takes time to understand the difference between civilian POWs and military POWs. There's an educational process.","People just don't know what civilian prisoners of war are.","Congress should let HRSA release its guidance and analyze its impact before making changes to the 340B program that would harm safety-net hospitals and our vulnerable patients.","I really think we need to see how we can expand our privacy laws.","I prefer that we sit down and craft a bill that addresses the many challenges we face, not only domestically, but as a world leader.","Allowing for endless legal challenges or partisan political discussions is not the proper way to handle an issue that affects the entire scope of the environment and the economy.","It is simply a moral obligation to make sure our nation's heroes have a home to return to at night.","Refineries are very energy-intensive.","As a policy-maker in our country, I would much rather we have that investment in our refineries.","Our federal resources, our U.S. marshals, and the federal court system are being used, I think, by the private sector.","I'd like to vote for a bill.

But our forefathers wanted us to compromise to get things done for America.","I represent a blue-collar district: people who work at petrochemical plants and machine shops.","I'm not a green like most Democrats would be. I have a blue-collar district.","I did have a constituent four or five years ago - she never liked me. So, she called, I returned her call, and she was complaining about something, and she said: 'And why do you always use green? I think it's narcissistic.' And I said, 'Well, ma'am, everyone has to have a gimmick, and that's my gimmick.'","I get better coverage on my Spanish stations than I do on my English stations.","I hear from broadcasters pretty often. Their ad revenue is down."],"Gene Hackman":["The difference between a hero and a coward is one step sideways.","Dysfunctional families have sired a number of pretty good actors.","Once, I optioned a novel and tried to do a screenplay on it, which was great fun, but I was too respectful. I was only 100 pages into the novel and I had about 90 pages of movie script going. I realized I had a lot to learn.","I was trained to be an actor, not a star. I was trained to play roles, not to deal with fame and agents and lawyers and the press.","If you look at yourself as a star, you've already lost something in the portrayal of any human being.","I'm disappointed that success hasn't been a Himalayan feeling.","I have trouble with direction, because I have trouble with authority. I was not a good Marine.","It really costs me a lot emotionally to watch myself on screen. I think of myself, and feel like I'm quite young, and then I look at this old man with the baggy chins and the tired eyes and the receding hairline and all that.","If I start to become a star, I'll lose contact with the normal guys I play best.","I do not like assassins, or men of low character.","Things parents say to children are oftentimes not heard, but in some cases you pick up on things that your parent would like to see you have done.","I'm not a sentimental guy.","You go through stages in your career that you feel very good about yourself. Then you feel awful, like, 'Why didn't I choose something else?' But overall I'm pretty satisfied that I made the right choice when I decided to be an actor.","I lost touch with my son in terms of advice early on. Maybe it had to do with being gone so much, doing location films when he was at an age where he needed support and guidance.","I don't like to talk about myself that much.","I went in the Marines when I was 16. I spent four and a half years in the Marines and then came right to New York to be an actor. And then seven years later, I got my first job.","My early days in Broadway were all comedies. I never did a straight play on Broadway.","Hollywood loves to typecast, and I guess they saw me as a violent guy.","I left home when I was 16 because I was looking for adventure.","The worst job I ever had was working nights in the Chrysler Building. I was part of a team of about five guys, and we polished the leather furniture.","I don't see myself as a violent guy.","I write in the morning from about eight till noon, and sometimes again a bit in the afternoon. In the morning I start off by going over what I had done the previous day, which my wife has happily typed up for me.","My wife and I take what we call our Friday comedy day off. We watch standup comics on TV. The raunchier the better. We love Eddie Izzard.","My grandfather had been a newspaper reporter, as was my uncle. They were pretty good writers and so I thought maybe somewhere down the line I would do some writing."],"Gene Kelly":["I got started dancing because I knew it was one way to meet girls.","There is a strange sort of reasoning in Hollywood that musicals are less worthy of Academy consideration than dramas. It's a form of snobbism, the same sort that perpetuates the idea that drama is more deserving of Awards than comedy.","When Ginger Rogers danced with Astaire, it was the only time in the movies when you looked at the man, not the woman.","I still find it almost impossible to relax for more than one day at a time.","At 14 I discovered girls. At that time dancing was the only way you could put your arm around the girl. Dancing was courtship.","My mother had gotten a job as a receptionist at a dancing school and had the idea that we should open our own dancing school; we did, and it prospered.","I wanted to do new things with dance, adapt it to the motion picture medium.","Things danced on the screen do not look the way they do on the stage. On the stage, dancing is three-dimensional, but a motion picture is two-dimensional.","I'd studied dance in Chicago every summer end taught it all winter, and I was well-rounded. I wasn't worried about getting a job on Broadway. In fact, I got one the first week.","I'll never starve.","I didn't want to be a dancer. I just did it to work my way through college. But I was always an athlete and gymnast, so it came naturally.","I think dancing is a man's game and if he does it well he does it better than a woman.","I arrived in Hollywood twenty pounds overweight and as strong as an ox."],"Gene Krupa":["When I speak of natural drummers I'm talking about guys that are playing with the talent God gave 'em.","If you're going to start with melody you'll need some tympani, I think.","Well I guess I like variety pretty much, but I do enjoy this work very much. Particularly with Buddy on the gig, we get a chance to knock each other out It'just wonderful.","Yes, I've had some pretty good luck finding wonderful talent."],"Gene Luen Yang":["Immigrant parents dream that their children will find a place in their new home, and they willingly suffer hardships in service to that dream. That was certainly true of my parents.","Creativity requires input, and that's what research is. You're gathering material with which to build.","'The Green Turtle' wasn't all that popular. He lasted only five issues of Blazing Comics before disappearing into obscurity.","My first job was as a programmer. So I feel like I'm familiar with the information technology sector and the information technology culture.","I noticed that when my daughter was born, my son really, really liked her. But then as she started getting older, and as she started crawling around our house and touching different things that were his, sibling rivalry issues started appearing.","We have to allow ourselves the freedom to make mistakes, including cultural mistakes, in our first drafts. I believe it's okay to get cultural details wrong in your first draft. It's okay if stereotypes emerge. It just means that your experience is limited, that you're human.","'The Green Turtle' was created in the 1940s by a cartoonist named Chu Hing, one of the first Asian Americans to work in the American comic book industry.","I've tried to write from my own understanding of identity in all my comics, whether it's about superheroes or historical conflicts or monkey gods.","I love the interplay between words and pictures. I love the fact that in comics, your pictures are acting like words, presenting themselves to be read.","When I was growing up, I did go to the arcade. We had a neighborhood arcade, and my friends and I would go fairly regularly.","When I first started making comics, I was living with a bunch of guys, old college friends. We had this deal. At the end of each day, they would ask me how far I'd gotten on my comic. And if I hadn't made my goals, they were supposed to make me feel really bad about myself. They happily obliged.","Ch'in Shih-huang is the first emperor of China. He united seven separate kingdoms into a single nation. He built the Great Wall and was buried with the terra-cotta soldiers. The Chinese have mixed feelings about him. They're proud of the nation he created, but he was a maniacal tyrant.","During the Cultural Revolution, the communists came in, and what they wanted to do was eradicate all sense of traditional Chinese culture.","My experience of Chinese culture is indirect, through echoes. When I approach the cashier at my local Chinese supermarket, they switch to English before I've even said a word. They somehow know that I'm not quite Chinese enough.","In 2000, Pope John Paul II canonized 120 saints of China, 87 of whom were ethnically Chinese. My home church was incredibly excited because this was the first time the Roman Catholic Church acknowledged Chinese citizens in this way.","Religion and culture are two important ways in which we as humans find our identity. That's certainly true for me.","My experiences growing up in both a Chinese American household and the Catholic Church define much of who I am.","In my research, I learned that the Boxers' kung fu wasn't all that formalized. The vast majority of them didn't belong to some age-old martial arts tradition. They were basically poor, starving teenagers doing the best they could to figure out how to fight, relying more on their mystical beliefs than formal training.","I got these big coffee table books about Chinese opera from the local library, and I loved looking through them. I loved studying the intricate costumes and figuring out how to 'cartoonify' them.","'Boxers' was more time consuming simply because it was longer, but 'Saints' was definitely harder. I think it's just hard to talk about faith in general.","I general don't color my stuff - I'm pretty horrible with color. Usually, I'll get one of my cartoonist friends to help me out.","When I looked into the lives of the Chinese saints, I discovered that many of them had died during the Boxer Rebellion, a war that occurred on Chinese soil in the year 1900.","I started 'American Born Chinese' as a mini-comic. I would write and draw a chapter, photocopy a hundred or so copies at the corner photocopy store, and then try to sell them on consignment through local comics shops. If I could sell maybe half a dozen, I'd be doing okay.","I talk about religion because it's one of the ways human beings find power and belonging. Religion is more than just that - I think faith traditions give us ways to talk about experiences of the numinous, too - but power and belonging are a big part of it.","The thing about research is that there's no end. You constantly have this fear that an expert who knows more than you will call you out on some detail in your book.","If I'm writing about a modern-day suburb, there's going to be details of the home and furniture, and if I'm writing about a historical period, those details, those pieces of the world are going to be there as well, but they'll be simplified, because I'm cartooning it.","I work at a high school, and we have an anime and manga club.","I finished 'American Born Chinese' in 2005, so after that, I started actively researching the Boxer Rebellion.","To be able to write 'Superman,' to be able to work with the legendary artist who is John Romita Jr., I signed on as soon as I could.","Superman has been around for so long; he's been around for, what, eight decades now? And he goes through these different eras where different aspects of who he is get emphasized.","This is a profession for me, but I started off as a self-publisher working on my own schedule and my own stuff before moving on to graphic novels with First Second Books, where there was definitely a schedule, but it was very different from monthly comics.","I minored in creative writing in college, and I've played with the idea of doing something more hybrid, but comics are my first love.","I think a lot of the things in my life that I become most passionate about, and most excited about, are all from comics.","In traditional Asian arts, the word and the picture always sit next to each other. I have an aunt, a Chinese brush painter, who told me that when you do a Chinese brush painting, you have to pair the image up with some poetry.","I'm a cartoonist. I write and draw comic books and graphic novels. I'm also a coder.","I majored in Computer Science at U.C. Berkeley and worked as a software developer for a couple of years. Then I taught high school computer science for over a decade and a half in Oakland, California.","I wanted to make an explicitly educational comic that taught readers the concepts I covered in my introductory programming class. That's what 'Secret Coders' is. It's both a fun story about a group of tweens who discover a secret coding school, and an explanation of some foundational ideas in computer science.","In my classroom, I would start my lessons with a quick review of an old topic. Then, I would introduce a new topic. Finally, I would give my students a problem to solve on their own, one that would reinforce what I'd just taught.","'Shadow Hero' was a dream to work on.","'Shadow Hero' was my first superhero story. I don't know why it took so long.","I kind of just write what I like to write. I'm thankful that readers of different ages seem to connect to my stories. I don't consciously think about age demographics when I'm working on my comics.","I love hearing people who are smarter than me talk about my comics. It makes me feel smarter.","I think, pretty much like everyone around my age, I grew up playing those classic video games. I wouldn't say I was addicted to them, but I definitely liked them.","A lot of Asians and Asian-Americans have liver problems. If you basically ask anybody who is Asian, they or one of their relatives will have some sort of a liver issue, and the liver actually falls into the jurisdiction of the gastroenterologist.","When 'American Born Chinese' started getting a lot of attention, I freaked out a little bit because I realized that up until then I had just been doing comics by following my gut. I didn't really know much about plot structure or anything; I kind of just followed my gut.","It's just nerve-wracking in general to write 'Superman,' right? I'm a life-long superhero fan, and he is the character that kicked off the entire genre.","I was a huge fan of the Bruce Timm animated series and, of course, the live action 'Lois & Clark' series. I watched that when I was in college.","I was a superhero fan in the '90s, so I'm definitely familiar with John Romita, Jr. In fact, when I was in high school, I would go to local conventions and line up and get his signature.","When I got the job with 'Superman,' it felt like somebody threw me into the ocean. I was just trying to figure it out, to figure out how to tread water. Lucky for me, I'm part of a great team.","Any superhero, regardless of how different they are from Superman, recalls Superman in some way. They're either pushing against Superman or reflecting Superman; there's something about them that comes from Superman.","Like all of us, I don't think Facebook is 100% evil, but there are aspects of it that move towards evilness. It's true of all the major Silicon Valley companies, that there are aspects to all of them that move towards evilness, but I don't believe they're 100% evil.","I think every time you work with another collaborator, there's an adjustment process where you figure out the other person's strengths, and that has definitely happened for me.","Dwayne McDuffie was one of my favorite writers. When I was growing up, he was one of the few African Americans working in American comics.","In the early '90s, I was finishing up my adolescence. I visited my local comic-book store on a weekly basis, and one week I found a book on the stands called 'Xombi,' published by Milestone Media.","We're afraid of writing characters different from ourselves because we're afraid of getting it wrong. We're afraid of what the Internet might say.","The premise of 'Secret Coders' is reminiscent of 'Harry Potter.' An intrepid band of tweens stumbles upon a secret school, only instead of teaching magic, the school teaches coding.","Comics are such a powerful educational tool. Simply put, there are certain kinds of information that are best communicated through sequential visuals.","Writing for myself and writing for another artist are two very different experiences. When I handle both the story and the art, I have full control. I can endlessly tweak every word and every line.","Superheroes were created in America, they're most popular in America, and at their best, they embody American ideals.","Every superhero has this superhero identity and a civilian identity. A lot of their lives are about code switching.","In academia in general, there's this push toward using comics as an educational tool.","I would hope that maybe math teachers could use 'Prime Baby' as a way of establishing an emotional connection between students and numbers.","There's bleeding between age groups in terms of reading material, and there's bleeding between media. So there are books that are clearly comics and books that are prose, and then there are these books that are kind of in-between.","I was really worried that sitting at home by myself in front of a computer was going to make me crazy.","Eventually, I just couldn't imagine myself being in a cubicle for my entire career.","I grew up with an Apple 2E - I had a deep, emotional attachment to that machine - and I loved doodling.","I took a Logo programming class in fifth grade. Logo is a language specifically designed for the classroom environment. It was basically doodling through words.","Superman is such an old character. He's an old character with this huge legacy behind him. And one of the awesome things about the fact that he's been around for these decades is that he's gone through these different phases.","It's a big deal to reveal your friend's deepest truth, your friend's deepest secret. And for all of us, when we do these big things, there's a complexity of motivation that comes behind that decision.","When I work on my own stuff - and I think this is true for anybody - but when you work on something that you just completely own, you are trying to stay as true to your own storytelling voice as you can.","When you work on a pre-existing character, when you end up getting invited to be part of a legacy character like Superman, I don't feel like it would be true to the character if all I did was go in looking to express my own voice.","Going from idea to production is a huge hurdle. It took me a while to overcome it. It's basically all about self discipline, right?","At any comic book convention in America, you'll find aspiring cartoonists with dozens of complex plot ideas and armloads of character sketches. Only a small percentage ever move from those ideas and sketches to a finished book.","Writing, for me, is very inspiration-dependent. And inspiration can be a jerk.","There's something about the intimacy of comics that gives you a false bravado; you don't always consider the consequences.","When you work with somebody else, you automatically get a mixed voice. You hope it will benefit the story. But you don't know what the result will be.","For 'Boxers and Saints', the tension between Eastern and Western ways of thinking was very personal for me, and I needed to control every aspect.","I grew up in a religious community, and like everyone, I went through a period of doubt and later made a conscious choice to embrace the faith of my childhood.","I have a fairly limited drawing style. I'm not like my friend Derek Kirk Kim, who can pretty much change his style at will. My drawing style can handle some of my stories, but not all of them.","I grew up on monthly comics. My closet is full of monthly comics. I've always wanted to do a monthly comic, and while I've had a couple of offers, the timing has never worked out. Most superhero comics come into the world as monthly series, so we wanted the same for 'The Shadow Hero.'","The most labor-intensive part of putting together a comic is the drawing.","Carl Barks and Don Rosa are two of my favorite cartoonists ever.","Dichotomies are an inherent part of comics, aren't they? Comics are both pictures and words. They blend time and space. Many feature characters with dual identities like Bruce Wayne/Batman. Cartoonists also tend to live dichotomous lives because many of us have day jobs.","My brain subconsciously limits itself to panel compositions that my hand can actually draw.","The Boxer Rebellion is a war that was fought on Chinese soil in the year 1900. The Europeans, the Japanese and their Chinese Christian allies were on one side. On the other were poor, starving, illiterate Chinese teenagers whom the Europeans referred to as the Boxers.","Nobody really knows for sure how the Boxer Rebellion started. It began among the poor, and the history of the poor is rarely written down.","As I was researching, I was struck by how similar the Boxers were to Joan of Arc. Joan was basically a French Boxer. She was a poor teenager who wanted to do something about the foreign aggressors invading her homeland.","'Avatar: The Last Airbender' is, to my mind, the greatest American animated series ever produced. The characters lived and breathed.","'Avatar: The Last Airbender' creators Mike DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko have, along with their team, painstakingly planned out the Avatarverse.","With my own comics, I try hard to get the vision in my head onto paper, to have one match the other as closely as possible. With the 'Airbender' comics, I'm working with someone else's vision, an already-established vision. I want to stay true to what's come before.","Many Japanese families moved to Taiwan during the occupation. Then, when the war ended, they were forced to move back. And at the macro level, the Taiwanese had every reason to cheer when the Japanese left. The Japanese military could often be incredibly brutal. The Taiwanese lived as second-class citizens on their own land.","I think there is always romantic tension between Lois Lane and Clark Kent.","I think the 'Boxers' book was easier for me to envision as a comic, because they were on this epic journey. These teenagers basically gathered into this army and marched to the capital city where they had a showdown with the Europeans and Japanese. On the 'Saints' side, it was a lot trickier.","Figuring out a way to balance the Boxer story with the Chinese Christians was difficult.","The project that I did between 'Boxer & Saints' was 'The Shadow Hero,' which is illustrated by Sonny Liew, an artist who lives in Singapore.","The rumor is Chu Hing really wanted the 'Green Turtle' to be Chinese American, but the publisher didn't think that would sell. If you read those books, the hero almost always has his back facing the camera so you can't see his face. When he turns around, his face is obscured.","Superman was created in the late 1930s, and humankind's idea of what the future would be was very different.","For 'American Born Chinese,' my first graphic novel with First Second Books, I did mostly 'memory' research. It's fiction, but I pulled heavily from my own childhood.","I never worked a job that required research. I'm not really good at it, to be honest.","For 'Boxers & Saints,' I started by reading a couple of articles on the Internet, then writing a really rough outline, then getting more hardcore into the research. I went to a university library once a week for a year, year and a half.","Both my mother and my father grew up in Asia, in a time of political instability. They'd earned college degrees before setting foot in the States but had to work menial jobs early on in order to make ends meet."],"Gene Mauch":["Baseball and malaria keep coming back.","You can't lead anyone else further than you have gone yourself.","Losing streaks are funny. If you lose at the beginning you got off to a bad start. If you lose in the middle of the season, you're in a slump. If you lose at the end, you're choking.","I'm not the manager because I'm always right, but I'm always right because I'm the manager.","Most one run games are lost, not won.","The worst thing is the day you realize you want to win more than the players do.","You have to bear in mind that Mr. Autry's favorite horse was named Champion. He ain't ever had one called Runner Up."],"Gene Oliver":["Every path serves a purpose.","When the student is ready... the lesson appears.","My past is my wisdom to use today... my future is my wisdom yet to experience. Be in the present because that is where life resides."],"Gene Pitney":["The thing I always liked best about touring abroad was constantly running into different people, different cultures, different foods. It really pumped up my batteries... I'm constantly playing to a demographically diverse audience... one generation is driven by nostalgia, the next by curiosity. And that's why I have no plans to retire.","People tell me all the time that I must be so sad. I never was. It's just the way I sing.","I'm a performer. I've tried everything there is.","I was just different. When the other kids gravitated to football or basketball, I went fishing and skating. I was into trapping animals, pheasants and squirrels. Not only was I trapper, I was a taxidermist.","Let's say I'm not feeling well, and somebody would say to me, 'Just do an easy show, just go out and do a light...' - I can't! I cannot do that kind of a show. I have to still put 150 percent into it, and it's funny: it's so healing to do that.","You have 'listeners' ears' when you're just starting out, and your 'listeners' ears' tell you what will work. You lose those ears later, when you break songs down into production elements too much.","I always feel that it's great when you can be happy when you're by yourself. That's not a bad thing."],"Gene Robinson":["The state's interest in marriage is stability. Generally speaking, polygamy does not work for stability. Inherent in the whole polygamous movement is a deep and abiding misogyny and denigration of women. So polygamy is objectionable on lots of grounds.","The bees learn where they live by landmarks. If they're moved within their home range, they get confused.","I think there's a terrible price to be paid when your exterior life is not an honest reflection of your interior life.","But by virtue of our baptism, Peter Akinola and I are brothers in Christ and one day we are going to be in heaven together, so we might as well learn to get along here because we will have to get along there. God won't have it any other way.","Faith is a dynamic and ever-changing process, not some fixed body of truth that exists outside our world and our understanding. God's truth may be fixed and unchanging, but our comprehension of that truth will always be partial and flawed at best.","God calls all of his children to the table. We can disagree and even say a lot of hateful things, but what we can't do in good conscience is leave the table. Or demand that someone else not be at the table.","If indeed this is the work of God... then it's a crisis that calls for the church to be its very best self, and not worry about risking itself for the right thing.","Sometimes there are things worth risking your life for. It was Jesus who said if you want to save your life, you have to lose it.","There are enormously gifted Episcopal priests around this church who are gay and lesbian, some of whom are partnered, who would make wonderful bishops and they're going to be nominated and they're going to be elected.","I think my election is one of several indications that gay and lesbian folk are being brought more into the center of things. I'd like to think that my election signals my bringing of gay and lesbian folk into the center of the church.","It's not about me. It's about not having to be ashamed.","I've long been really intrigued with what is the... proper role of faith and religion in public life.","You know, we live in a time when if somebody wants to kill you, they're going to kill you, and you can either go in a hole and, you know, pull the roof in over you, or you just continue putting one foot in front of the other and hope that you're doing some good in the world.","One of the joys of being a Christian or being a person of faith is that you believe deep down that death isn't the worst thing, you know. Not living your life: that's the worst thing. And death is not, it's not all it's cracked up to be. It's not, it's not the end of the world.","I think people often come to the synagogue, mosque, the church looking for God, and what we give them is religion.","Stability is why society has an interest in marriage.","The truly longstanding tradition in the church is that some are called to celibacy. Some feel called to it. But the church has never supported that celibacy be mandated for someone not called to it. It's never imposed on someone.","When you claim to have the truth, as opposed to the truth as you perceive it, then you move us toward a theocratic view of government.","I will always speak out when someone says that a principle or a rule or a tradition trumps people.","You know, I think Jesus was famous and also in a lot of trouble because he always chose people over sort of established procedures.","And God is always calling me to open myself to all kinds of people that I've never thought about before and also calling me on this inward spiritual journey.","Discerning the will of God is a very tricky thing, partly because, you know, the little voice in my head can either be God's voice or it can be my own ego doing a magnificent impression of God's voice.","Only God is the same yesterday, today and tomorrow. The Church has always been changing.","It seems to me that if God calls us to anything it's to a life of integrity.","Historically speaking, institutions are slow to change and usually resistant to any sudden moves - churches especially so.","Left to our own devices and passions, we human beings have a hard time seeing beyond what is immediately in front of us.","What I love about believing in a living God is that I believe God is constantly revealing God's self to us over time, and with each succeeding generation, we come a little closer to understanding the mind of God."],"Gene Roddenberry":["I'd been an Army bomber pilot and fascinated by the Navy and, particularly, the story of the Enterprise, which at Midway really turned the tide in the whole war in our favor. I'd always been proud of that ship and wanted to use the name.","When you get into an airplane by yourself and take off, you find yourself in this lovely, three-dimensional world where you can go in any direction. There is no feeling any more exciting than that.","'Star Trek' was an attempt to say humanity will reach maturity and wisdom on the day that it begins not just to tolerate but take a special delight in differences in ideas and differences in lifeforms.","The Russians were responsible for the Chekov character. They put in 'Pravda' that, 'Ah, the ugly Americans are at it again. They do a space show, and they forget to include the people who were in space first.' And I said, 'My God, they're right.'","Time is the fire in which we burn.","I hope that I helped to build a fierce pride in what we are and what we can do if we set our minds to it.","The strength of a civilization is not measured by its ability to fight wars, but rather by its ability to prevent them.","Earth is the nest, the cradle, and we'll move out of it.","No, ancient astronauts did not build the pyramids - human beings built them, because they're clever and they work hard.","A man either lives life as it happens to him, meets it head-on and licks it, or he turns his back on it and starts to wither away.","'Star Trek' speaks to some basic human needs: that there is a tomorrow - it's not all going to be over with a big flash and a bomb; that the human race is improving; that we have things to be proud of as humans.","It was 'ST' format to let space and alien worlds, rather than human weakness, provide the conflict and danger necessary to our adventure show.","These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its five year mission... to boldly go where no man has gone before.","We stress humanity, and this is done at considerable cost. We can't have a lot of dramatics that other shows get away with - promiscuity, greed, jealousy. None of those have a place in 'Star Trek.'","'Star Trek' says that it has not all happened, it has not all been discovered, that tomorrow can be as challenging and adventurous as any time man has ever lived.","'Star Trek' episodes always insisted that humanity is on its bumpy way to what will be a glorious future in the 23rd century, in which we will have left most of our old selfishness - and old hatreds and prejudices - far behind us.","We must question the story logic of having an all-knowing all-powerful God, who creates faulty Humans, and then blames them for his own mistakes.","It has become a crusade of mine to demonstrate that TV need not be violent to be exciting.","I wanted to send a message to the television industry that excitement is not made of car chases.","It is important to the typical 'Star Trek' fan that there is a tomorrow. They pretty much share the 'Star Trek' philosophies about life: the fact that it is wrong to interfere in the evolvement of other peoples, that to be different is not necessarily to be wrong or ugly.","What Kirk wanted every evening was to go to bed with a beautiful woman. Our captain now is a man of infinitely more skill. A better man.","I wanted to cast a woman as second in command. NBC said no way.","If 'Trek' is a hit, we'd love to do a series of films - a regular event. Look at James Bond's films. They've been around since the early sixties.","His name is 'Mr. Spock.' And the first view of him can be almost frightening - a face so heavy-lidded and satanic you might almost expect him to have a forked tail. Probably half Martian, he has a slightly reddish complexion and semi-pointed ears.","'Star Trek' is a 'Wagon Train' concept - built around characters who travel to worlds 'similar' to our own, and meet the action-adventure-drama which become our stories. Their transportation is the cruiser 'S.S. Yorktown,' performing a well-defined and long-range Exploration-Science-Security mission which helps create our format.","The human race is a remarkable creature, one with great potential, and I hope that 'Star Trek' has helped to show us what we can be if we believe in ourselves and our abilities.","I have felt many times trapped by 'Star Trek.' It cost me dearly. It won't anymore, because I've come to grips with what it is and where it fits in my life.","Normal television limits what you can do. With science fiction, you can exercise your imagination more. I fell in love with it.","I remember myself as an asthmatic child, having great difficulties at 7, 8 and 9 years old, falling totally in love with 'Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle' and dreaming of having his strength to leap into trees and throw mighty lions to the ground.","I was tired of writing for shows where there was always a shoot-out in the last act and somebody was killed. 'Star Trek' was formulated to change that.","My model for Kirk was Horatio Hornblower from the C.S. Forester sea stories. Shatner was open-minded about science fiction and a marvelous choice.","To cast Mr. Spock, I made a phone call to Leonard, and he came in. That was it.","The ship's transporters - which let the crew 'beam' from place to place - really came out of a production need. I realized with this huge spaceship, I would blow the whole budget of the show just in landing the thing on a planet.","When they put out the sales brochure when we eventually went to series, they carefully rounded Spock's ears and made him look human so he wouldn't scare off potential advertisers.","Our effects were primitive. Our stars were a black cloth with holes in it and light behind.","Because something or someone looks or acts differently from us does not necessarily mean that it is ugly or bad.","We tried to limit human versus human conflict only to those cases where it could be powerfully motivated and made completely believable."],"Gene Saks":["For me, I had to overcome shyness to be an actor. But as a director, you lose your subjectivity, your self-consciousness. And instead of just your role, it's the life of the whole play that becomes a reflection of you.","Playwrights are naturally wary and protective - God, who's more protective than a playwright? You read a play, the playwright wants to hear from you immediately.","If you are a Rothschild, a Rosenwald, a Gimbel, or even a Waldbaum, growing up Jewish can be a rich experience. For the rest of us, it could be just so-so.","Some of us shorten our names or our noses or both... We Jews can be extremely neurotic and are inclined to become easily depressed. Most Jews seldom say, 'Have a nice day' or even have one. To be honest, I've never heard a Jew say that. We're just not that optimistic. Life is neither a bed of roses nor a bowl of cherries."],"Gene Sarazen":["I don't care what you say about me. Just spell the name right.","The more I practice, the luckier I get."],"Gene Scott":["It would take wild horses to get me to talk.","The human element should be the two players on the court, not the officials. The best officials are the ones you never notice. The nature of the game made officials too noticeable a part."],"Gene Simmons":["The makeup is simply an extension of the personality and colors, clothing, makeup all express something.","I'm fascinated with myself and love hearing the sound of my own voice. I'd like to hear what I have to say. A lot of people don't like being alone because they truly don't like themselves, but I love me.","I don't wait for the calendar to figure out when I should live life.","The sad thing is most people have to check with someone before they do the things that make them happy. We're all passing through; the least we can do is be happy, and the only way to do that is by being selfish.","I fail all of the time. It means nothing.","Live and think like a poor man and you'll always be OK.","If you're the greatest, it's okay to say you're the greatest. My suggestion to everybody is to be their own greatest fan. Weaker personas and personalities define that as egotistical or arrogant, but what it means is their self-esteem isn't that strong.","James Bond has a license to kill, rockstars have a license to be outrageous. Rock is about grabbing people's attention.","Rock is about finding who you are. You don't necessarily have to play your instrument very well at all. You can just barely get by and you can be in a rock band.","If someone likes you, they'll buy what you're selling, whether or not they need it.","Life is too short to have anything but delusional notions about yourself.","I think I know it all, relatively speaking.","It's in the history books, the Holocaust. It's just a phrase. And the truth is it happened yesterday. It happened to my mother. I never met my grandmothers or my grandfathers. They were all wiped up in the gas chambers of Nazi Germany.","My mother had a horrific life. At fourteen, she was in the Nazi concentration camps. Her sense about life now is, every day above ground is a good day.","Television and comic books are, and continue to be, probably the biggest influence in my life. It's the biggest influence on everybody's life.","Don't believe bands who say it's all about the fans and they want to give their music away for free. The result is they will continue to live in their mother's basement.","Kiss is not a charity. Never, ever mix commerce and charity.","Never underestimate the power of being popular in pop culture. You have to be able to do something. You can have a good seat at the restaurant, but you still have to pay for the meal. Fame is important, but to be rich is more important.","I'm in a weird band. We've done very well. The American Dream is alive and well.","Kiss is a Fourth of July fireworks show with a backbeat.","Everyone in Kiss is replaceable. My ego will tell you that I am not, but that's not so.","You know why I'm pulling your leg? Because I can't touch it from where I am.","First, when I was 12, I saw a Spanish girl jumping rope. I never saw her face, but it was still the most beautiful sight I'd ever seen.","You can't go through life and leave things the way they are. We can all make a difference, and if I die today, I know I made a difference.","The only jobs kids have are to do well in school, to be charming and polite, and be thankful. That's it. I'll house you, protect you, I'll even give my life for you, and in return, you will behave.","I think it's pathetic that women and men treat each other worse than we treat our pets. It's love or hate.","When you are a rock star in front of 20,000 people, you receive instant gratification. A rock star on tour is a king in his domain.","I have to have an emotional connection to what I am ultimately selling because it is emotion, whether you are selling religion, politics, even a breath mint.","The best you can do is set your kids on the right track; staying on it without falling is up to the kids.","I was never interested in being a rock star. I always wanted to be Boris Karloff.","I refuse to stand up in front of a rabbi and my friends and the woman I love - who I will tell you I can love with all my heart - and promise she will be the only one I will ever have until the day I die. That's a lie.","I wanted to be in a band that gave bang for the buck. I wanted to be in the band who didn't look like a bunch of guys who, you know, should be in a library studying for their finals.","I'd like to think that the boring lady who's talking to me now is a lot sexier and more interesting than the one who's doing NPR. You know, studious and reserved, and - I bet you're a lot of fun at a party.","My mother is probably the wisest person I've ever known. She's not schooled, she's not well read. But she has a philosophy of life that makes well-read people seem like morons.","My skin is more beautiful than yours. I would be quite more popular in jail if I so chose.","No. Better research needed. Fire your research person. No fishnet stockings. Never. Not in this band.","When you really think about it, I'm not delusional enough to think that what I do is important to life as we know it on this planet. No. But neither is what you do.","I'm forbidden fruit. Once you go to certain households, mommy doesn't want you to see that dirty man who sticks his tongue out and spits out blood and all that stuff.","When you look at Clark Kent when he's working at the Daily Planet, he's a reporter. He doesn't fly through the air in his glasses and his suit.","When you walk through a bad neighborhood, you don't want a poodle by your side. You want a Rottweiler.","Marriage is an institution, and you must be fully committed to it.","The root of all evil isn't money; rather, it's not having enough money.","Everybody hates critics.","I want to do everything. I want to be the president, I want to learn Tae Kwan Do, I want to climb mountains. I'm always bugged by the notion that I can't do everything.","If you're building a house, or doing anything, time is what you've got. Well, there's effort, but you need time. The more time you put into something, the better stuff you can make.","Well, I'm like most Americans, we don't vote by party, we both by the person because a person is bigger than the party, which is why sometimes the Democrats get in and sometimes the Republicans get in.","I voted for President Bush, I voted for President Clinton, and, although I do want my vote back, I voted for President Obama.","Fiscally, I'm very conservative. I don't believe in welfare states. I believe in giving people jobs.","There is nothing that I would do ever to break my mother's heart.","I also learned that I love making money. Anyone who is not afraid of work will be happy with the money they make.","I crave ideas, and when an idea hits me, it grips me and it tortures me until I master it.","People who are the salt of the earth get up and go to a job that they hate.","I've always been anti-marriage for men until they become mature. As a species we don't mature until we're in our 60s.","The biggest financial pitfall in life is divorce. And the biggest reason for divorce is marriage.","England is a profoundly bizarre place that has produced thousands of bands the world has worshipped.","Sugar-free ice pops are an invention of God. They hardly have any calories since they're mostly water. I eat about 15 pops every two days.","I worship scones and danishes. If I never had another meal, I wouldn't care as long as I could eat pastries and jelly doughnuts.","I know that you like to see a man in the kitchen, but I'm skeptical of men who cook. A man should be focusing his attention on the woman, and not what's on the stove.","Nobody does just one thing. But the real difference between being an entrepreneur and everyone else in the world is the ability to monetize. I am an entrepreneur in the classic mold.","If you look at the CEOs of some the most successful companies in the world like IKEA, they never fly first class. They always go economy.","I fly economy. I do often fly first class, but I don't travel with a posse, or bodyguard, or an assistant.","I would urge all bands that say they only care about credibility and don't care about money to send Gene Simmons every dollar that they don't want. I'd be happy to take it off them.","Before a show, you might have aches or pains, or it's a bad rainy day, or it's too humid. We all complain about stuff. But... how do I put this poetically? Once it's the roar of the crowd and the smell of the greasepaint, forget it. Once the adrenaline kicks in and your chest expands, you forget about all that.","If you win a race, you don't ask how you did it, as long as you do it.","In theater, you're playing characters. You believe you're somebody else, and you're acting.","If you think about it, critics are an unnecessary life-form on the planet Earth, and here's why: because it's a job without credentials. You don't have to go to school.","I'm from Israel, so America has no limits. I started a record label, and then I started managing other artists, like Liza Minelli.","Personally I support 14,000 kids in Zambia - I feed and clothe them - but I don't hold press conferences about it. I don't do it so you'll think what a nice person I am; it's private.","I work for everything I've got. I started off as a very poor kid. I want to get paid.","I don't wanna go on vacation. There's nothing about it that appeals to me. People look forward to doing that; I look forward to getting up every day and doing something.","I like to approach every day like it's the only day I will ever have.","The Beatles weren't like any other band. Everybody in the band sang, which is why you knew everybody in the band.","Music is feeling. You can try to verbalize it. It really just hits you or it doesn't.","Never negotiate with kids. They don't have life experience, and they don't have repercussions for bad decisions; they still get fed and housed.","To be in a band on the road is to have anything and everything you want just by picking up the phone.","I don't sleep all that much, but when I do, it's sound.","I am an entrepreneur in the classic mold. No matter what I do - outside of sticking my tongue out - I tend to make money, and quite a bit in non-KISS stuff.","I do often fly first class, but I don't travel with a posse, or bodyguard, or an assistant."],"Gene Siskel":["After 27 years, I walked out of my first one a few months ago. Black Sheep with Chris Farley.","But you know, really, if you think about it Roger and I and all critics really have one absolute essential part of our credentials and that is that you believe that that is actually what we think.","I'm not surprised that Spielberg was able to capture the heroism of Schindler; so many of his movies are about the better part of mankind.","In fact, Cannonball Run II. I used to pick that as the worst movie ever made.","Is this film more interesting than a documentary of the same actors having lunch?","John Goodman is more that just a big guy, he's a wonderful actor.","That's probably when I get the most angry at American movies, when they just so cynically manipulate the audience without even trying to give a good story.","The only actor who I think probably might have possibly taken a swing at me if he could have would be Burt Reynolds. He used to call Roger and me the Bruise Brothers, out of Chicago.","The result is a picture that represents so much of what I want and rarely get from a movie - a couple of hours filled with characters who are as exciting as the people I know in real life.","They know they got the TV ad, they know they got the name recognition, they know that they can do a tie in with McDonald's or some fast food outlet and the money is just gonna flow in.","We don't pretend to disagree.","We'd rather see a picture that we liked then dump on one we didn't.","I would rather turn my head and cough than see any part of 'Patch Adams' again. The title of this movie should have been 'Punch Adams!'","Going to a movie is a two-hour experience; at $7.50 for a ticket, you are valuing your time at far less than the minimum wage. If you don't understand the film, don't leave. If you understand it all too well and hate it, get out of your seat and walk up the aisle. You will feel empowered.","For my 50th birthday, I got ahold of a new print of 'Saturday Night Fever.' I see it much more as a tough coming-of-age movie than as a disco story."],"Gene Sperling":["One of the things we have to remember about the poorest countries in the world is that parents, extremely poor parents, are making the choice of whether to send their girls to school. And they are struggling with lack of water, lack of firewood, and lack of care for their youngest children. And those burdens fall on the girls.","There is no question in the world that educating a girl is good for her country and good for her. The challenge is, is it good for her parents who are living in extreme poverty, who need the girl's help to take care of getting firewood, water, taking care of young children?","I think Americans have big hearts.","You never see a child die from education on TV. But make no mistake about it: children die from lack of education all the time. Children without an education are more likely to grow up to have HIV/AIDS. They're more likely to die in infancy or before the age of five."],"Gene Tierney":["Life is a little like a message in a bottle, to be carried by the winds and the tides.","Jealousy is, I think, the worst of all faults because it makes a victim of both parties.","Some women feel the best cure for a broken heart is a new beau.","I remember the 1940s as a time when we were united in a way known only to that generation. We belonged to a common cause-the war.","We cannot calculate the numbers of people who left, fled or were fished out of Europe just ahead of the Holocaust.","I knew I could not cope with the future unless I was able to rediscover the past.","When my mood was high, I seemed normal, even buoyant. I felt smarter. I had secrets. I could see God in a light bulb.","When you have spent an important part of your life playing Let's Pretend, it's often easy to see symbolism where none exists.","I admire anyone who rids himself of an addiction.","Cars, furs, and gems were not my weaknesses.","The main cause of my difficulties stemmed from the tragedy of my daughter's unsound birth and my inability to face my feelings.","Houses are one of my passions. I probably should have been an interior decorator.","Those who become mentally ill often have a history of chronic pain.","I was not cut out to be a rebel.","I followed the same diet for 20 years, eliminating starches, living on salads, lean meat, and small portions.","Day after day, I spent long afternoons in the talent pool, being told how to walk, how to talk, how to sit.","Everyone should see Hollywood once, I think, through the eyes of a teenage girl who has just passed a screen test.","When I met Jack Kennedy, he was a serious young man with a dream. He was not a womanizer, not as I understood the term.","What a different world it was when I first sailed for Europe in 1930, with my mother, sister, and brother to spend six months abroad.","Wealth, beauty, and fame are transient. When those are gone, little is left except the need to be useful.","Unlike the stage, I never found it helpful to be good in a bad movie.","Trying to make order out of my life was like trying to pick up a jellyfish.","Throughout my career, I was to be cast as a frontier girl, an aristocrat, an Arabian, a Eurasian, a Polynesian, and a Chinese.","There were days that I worked all the time, without a layoff, or a rest, finishing one picture and reporting for another sometimes on the same day.","The word actress has always seemed less a job description to me than a title.","The Howard Hughes I knew began to change after his plane crash in 1941.","The Hollywood structure was monopolistic, run by four or five big studios.","Rehearsals and screening rooms are often unreliable because they can't provide the chemistry between an audience and what appears on the stage or screen.","My mother would not talk to me for weeks, would not stay under my roof for as long as I was married to Oleg.","My departure from Hollywood was described as a walk-out. No one understood that I was cracking up.","Men are wonderful. I adore them. They always give you the benefit of the doubt.","It was the fashion of the time, still is, to feel that all actors are neurotic, or they would not be actors.","It is difficult to write about any form of mental disease, especially your own, without sounding as if you were examining a bug under glass.","In the months leading up to World War II, there was a tendency among many Americans to talk absently about the trouble in Europe. Nothing that happened an ocean away seemed very threatening.","In my early days in Hollywood I tried to be economical. I designed my own clothes, much to my mother's distress.","In later years, I craved foods that were almost always fattening.","I'm not sure I can explain the nature of Jack Kennedy's charm, but he took life just as it came.","I was plunged into what was known as the debutante social whirl. This was one of the ways fathers justified their own hard work and sacrifices.","I was going to live on my salary or go down swinging.","I was fortunate enough to work under directors who were, most of them, brilliant, emotional men.","I was fine when it came to cheering up others, not so fine with myself.","I used up every cent I earned as an actress.","I used to annoy my father by telling him how much I felt luck was with me.","I simply did not want my face to be my talent.","I needed to be accepted, not humored. I intended to act.","I loved to eat. For all of Hollywood's rewards, I was hungry for most of those 20 years.","I learned quickly at Columbia that the only eye that mattered was the one on the camera.","I hole up now and then and do nothing for days but read.","I have a role now that I think becomes me. I am a grandmother.","I had no romantic interest in Gable. I considered him an older man.","I had known Cole Porter in Hollywood and New York, spent many a warm hour at his home, and met the talented and original people who were drawn to him.","I had been offered a Hollywood contract before my 18th birthday. It gave me the spark I needed.","I existed in a world that never is - the prison of the mind.","I do not recall spending long hours in front of a mirror loving my reflection.","I dated dozens of young men, had fun with all, made commitments to none.","I ask myself: Would I have been any worse off if I had stayed home or lived on a farm instead of shock treatments and medication?","I approached everything, my job, my family, my romances, with intensity.","I am not the kind of woman who excuses her mistakes while reminding us of what used to be.","I always tried to play my hunches.","Hollywood can be hard on women, but it did not cause my problems.","For years it never occurred to me to question the judgment of those in charge at the studio.","Fonda and Gary Cooper had the best sense of timing of all the actors I knew.","Eccentric behavior is not routinely noticed around a movie set.","Children don't understand about people loving each other and then suddenly not.","Chaplin was notoriously strict with his sons and rarely gave them spending money.","As an actress, I was trained to show emotion I did not feel, or no emotion at all.","About my career I was serious and earnest, sometimes impatient."],"Gene Tunney":["To enjoy the glow of good health, you must exercise.","Exercise should be regarded as tribute to the heart.","The way to know about championship quality is to learn from champions, and that I did; studying them with professional purpose during my time in the ring and from habitual interest afterward.","As a West Side kid fooling around with boxing gloves, I had been, for some reason of temperament, more interested in dodging a blow than in striking one.","A boxer's diet should be low in fat and high in proteins and sugar. Therefore you should eat plenty of lean meat, milk, leafy vegetables, and fresh fruit and ice cream for sugar.","Never eat less than four hours before boxing. Then eat only lightly.","Fat is one of the chief enemies of the heart because it has to be plentifully supplied with blood and thus needlessly increases the pumping load that the heart must sustain.","Though I was not a belligerent kid, I do not think I ever passed up a good opportunity to fight.","My own ambition in the ring had always been skillful boxing, speed and defense - on the order of Mike Gibbons.","A concave chest means that your diaphragm is sagging.","Handball, swimming, running, jumping, basketball, and boxing were as much a part of me as breathing.","Upon awakening in the morning, I wondered if the proceedings of the night before had been a dream. It was hard to believe that I was the world's heavyweight champion.","The man who has allowed his body to deteriorate cuts a pitiful figure - chest collapsed, stomach protruding.","One half-conscious thought was burned in my mind: stay on your feet.","Normally, I could hit hard enough, as anyone who studied my fights might have known. But the impression was that I was essentially defensive, the very reverse of a killer, the prize fighter who read books, even Shakespeare.","In youth, we get plenty of exercise through games and running around, but as middle life approaches, we settle down, literally and figuratively.","If all human lives depended upon their usefulness - as might be judged by certain standards - there would be a sudden and terrific mortality in the world.","I did six years of planning to win the championship from Jack Dempsey.","Ever since boyhood I've made a religion of keeping in shape by regular, conscientious exercise.","A boxer must exercise and develop every part of his body."],"Gene Vincent":["I hope my fans remember my name is Gene Vincent and not Gene Autry.","I'm a crack shot and I've won medals for shooting. But I don't think I could shoot a person."],"Gene Ween":["A few years ago, one of our singles got beaten out by Better Than Ezra. The label could only have one band at a time being taken to the right people at radio, and they opted for Better Than Ezra instead of us. Who knows.","A lot of those songs are actually about Sarah, who I was recently divorced from about five or six months ago. I'd been seeing her off and on since I was about nineteen, so a lot of those songs are about her.","Basically, Pizza Hut just backed out on the ad agency at the last minute. They got fired and we got fired. It was a simple as that. We do stuff like that on and off.","Forty minutes in front of Beck isn't really where it's at.","I can't take any more white boys noodling around on their guitars.","I want to sound like Christopher Cross in another ten years, and be totally proud of it.","I was never into smart college boy music.","I wrote most of these songs right before the end. A lot of these songs are about that. Even if it's not direct, you can feel the beginning of the end of the breakup in these songs.","I'm a very big Notorious B.I.G. fan and I do an imitation of him that always cracks everybody up.","Most of our fans seem to be very intelligent people who don't stand out too much, but they're still total freaks. I like that - they're smart and sadistic, which I think is a reflection at us.","Ninety-nine per cent of opening bands stink.","Not after the big bust in '92, there's no big drug lifestyle anymore. I can't talk about it. Pretty ugly.","Now in a way, money is money, and if it's going to increase our audience, that's fine.","We are going to put out a boxed set thing, but I don't want to do it yet. I want to wait until we're 45 and we're bitter and broke. Then, we'll put out the comprehensive Ween boxed set.","We had been working. We had a bunch of songs written and it came time to make the record, so we had our lawyer make the call to Elektra and ask for our advance. Then, we got dropped. It was actually exciting.","We love doing commercial and TV show work.","We sold a certain, steady amount of product for them and they could count on it. When it came time to ask for the money for this new record, they dropped us. It was fine with us. It was a dead fish.","When it comes to the recording and writing, it's still mostly Mickey and I. But now there's this whole live entity that's a whole different thing, and it seems to be where we're gaining the most popularity.","You know, it's absolutely connected to The Mollusk in that, it's what we're writing after The Mollusk. A lot of this stuff reminds me of things on The Mollusk.","In life sometimes, in the universe, you have to close some doors to have others open.","My decision to leave 'Ween', however interpreted, was absolutely not made in haste.","Know that I am extremely proud of all that is 'Ween.'"],"Gene Weingarten":["When you are interviewing someone, don't just write down what he says. Ask yourself: Does this guy remind you of someone? What does the room feel like? Notice smells, voice inflection, neighborhoods you pass through. Be a cinematographer.","The whole point of corporate mascots is to be distinctive. No one in his right mind would ever confuse the Hamburglar with Mayor McCheese.","I felt like I was never going to be a great writer. I felt like I was going to be a good writer at best. I wanted to be great at something.","Sometimes, homely things are done for the best reasons in the world and thus achieve a beauty of their own.","Because I live and work in Washington, D.C., I have a ringside seat at the world capital of The Persuasive Arts, or, as I like to call it, The Opinions Racket.","While it is true that many hep C victims became infected through blood transfusions or organ transplants or in other innocent ways, mine was contracted during my college years, when I showed as much care for my personal health as your average suicide bomber.","The Pulitzer is a crapshoot. Your piece has to hit a few people the right way at the right moment.","I have two favorites: Reading Kierkegaard while listening to Mozart's Piano Concerto 9 in E Flat Major, and reading early Bazooka Joe comics in Hebrew.","When she was too young to resist, or even to understand, I turned my daughter into a lifelong, rabid Yankees fan.","I am the most skilled parallel parker the world has ever known.","For $60, I once bought a neck massage at a 'massage parlor' that advertised in 'The Washington Post.'"],"Gene Wilder":["I never thought of it as God. I didn't know what to call it. I don't believe in devils, but demons I do because everyone at one time or another has some kind of a demon, even if you call it by another name, that drives them.","I'm going to tell you what my religion is. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Period. Terminato. Finito.","I never used to believe in fate. I used to think you make your own life, and then you call it fate.","I trust if your life is right, the right things will happen at the right time. If the chords are in harmony inside, I think other things will happen in the same way. That sounded highfalutin' to me once, but I believe it now.","I'm funny on camera sometimes. In life, once in a while. Once in a while.","When I'm not working on something, I seem to go through periods of depression. It helps to keep busy.","My mother was suffering every day of her life, and what right did I have to be happy if she was suffering? So whenever I got happy about something, I felt the need to cut it off, and the only way to cut it off was to pray. 'Forgive me Lord.' For what, I didn't know.","When your mother gives you confidence about anything that you do, you carry that confidence with you.","The thing I love about making movies is the peace of mind that I know I don't have to be perfect the first time. I can be perfect the second time or the third time.","Success is a terrible thing and a wonderful thing. If you can enjoy it, it's wonderful. If it starts eating away at you, and they're waiting for more from me, or what can I do to top this, then you're in trouble. Just do what you love. That's all I want to do.","I like writing books. I'd rather be at home with my wife. I can write, take a break, come out, have a glass of tea, give my wife a kiss, and go back in and write some more. It's not so bad. I am really lucky.","My basic mistake in 'The World's Greatest Lover' was that I made the leading character a neurotic kook and sent him to Hollywood. I should have made him a perfectly normal, sane, ordinary person, and sent him to Hollywood. The audience identifies with the lead character.","Pride is not the worst of sins. In fact, it's one of the most interesting ones.","The world is not based on fairness. Human beings can rise to fairness, can administer something that makes it fair or just. But that's not God.","I love acting, especially if it's a fantasy of some kind, where it's not just realistic, it's not naturalism.","I've had a very good life and a very good career. I have no regrets.","What I learned from Mel Brooks was audacity - in performance as in life. Maybe you go too far, but try it.","I write funny. If I can make my wife laugh, I know I'm on the right track.","I'm not from Hollywood, and I'm also not one of the people who wants to do a tell-all, and I hate tell-alls. I didn't want to tell all.","I want to do what I can lend my talents to, but I want it to be as a human being and not as a two-dimensional character.","A lot of comic actors derive their main force from childish behavior. Most great comics are doing such silly things; you'd say, 'That's what a child would do.'","Actors fall into this trap if they missed being loved for who they really were and not for what they could do - sing, dance, joke about - then they take that as love.","And in 'Frisco Kid' and in 'The Woman in Red' I had to ride badly. Then you have to really ride well in order to ride badly.","I don't mean to sound - I don't want it to come out funny, but I don't like show business. I love - I love acting in films. I love it.","I love the art of acting, and I love film, because you always have another chance if you want it. You know, if we - if this isn't going well, you can't say - well, you could say - let's stop. Let's start over again, Gene, because you were too nervous.","I wanted to do - there was this film called 'Magic' that Anthony Hopkins did. And the director wanted me. The writer wanted me. Joe Levine said no, I don't want any comedians in this.","I write funny. If I can make my wife laugh, I know I'm on the right track. But yes, I don't like to get Maudlin. And I have a tendency towards it.","I'd like to do a comedy with Emma Thompson. I admire her as an actress so much. I love her. And I didn't know it until recently that her whole career started in comedy.","I'm not so funny. Gilda was funny. I'm funny on camera sometimes. In life, once in a while. Once in a while. But she was funny. She spent more time worrying about being liked than anything else.","So my idea of neurotic is spending too much time trying to correct a wrong. When I feel that I'm doing that, then I snap out of it.","Great art direction is NOT the same thing as great film direction!","I'm in complete remission. I'm alive and well.","My favorite author is Anton Chekhov, not so much for the plays but for his short stories, and I think he was really my tutor.","Lots of things are hard work, but I think writing, for me, after I started acting at 13 years old. I like writing now much more than I do acting only because, well, partly because the scripts that are offered are junk.","I'm stopped by mothers who say, 'Mr. Wilder, what advice would you give to my young boy? He's really talented.'","I had a unique form: a Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.","My wife and I water color, paint water colors.","Sidney Poitier was directing a film called 'Hanky Panky.' And he said, 'Do you want to come with me to New York to see Gilda Radner in 'Lunch Hour' on Broadway? I said, 'I don't need to see her, I love her. I've wanted to write something for her for a long time. So it's OK by me.'","I had a daughter and lost her a long while ago. That's too sad a story to go into.","If something comes along that's really good, and I think I would be good for it, I'd be happy to do it. But not too many came along. I mean, they came along for the first, I don't know, 15, 18 films, but I didn't do that many. But then I didn't want to do the kind of junk I was seeing.","Mel Brooks is one of the few authentic geniuses working in comedy in America today.","I worked two days in Texas and two days in Hollywood on 'Bonnie and Clyde,' and that was it. I had no idea how it was going to turn out. And when I saw it, I was so upset, or fascinated, or something, by the sight of myself on the screen that I could hardly pay attention to the rest of the movie.","We all grew up on movies with scenes where the actor is lying, and you know he's lying, but he wants to make sure you know it's a lie, and so he overacts and all but winks at you, and everybody in the world except for the girl he's talking to knows he's lying.","What good is a character who's always winking at the audience to let them in on the secret?","I don't like giving speeches. It makes me nervous.","When I was in desperate trouble for maybe eight or nine years, I went to a neuropsychiatrist.","I feel very Jewish, and I feel very grateful to be Jewish. But I don't believe in God or anything to do with the Jewish religion.","I'm an actor, not a clown.","What do actors really want? To be great actors? Yes, but you can't buy talent, so it's best to leave the word 'great' out of it. I think to be believed, onstage or onscreen, is the one hope that all actors share.","If my mother hadn't laughed at the funny things I did, I probably wouldn't be a comic actor. After she had her first heart attack, the doctor said, 'Try to make her laugh.' And that was the first time I tried to make anyone laugh.","I'm not a natural writer like, let's say - I'm not talking about Arthur Miller; that's a whole other thing - but let's say Woody Allen. But the more I've written, the more I've found that there is a deep well in me somewhere that wants to express things that I'm not going to find unless I write them myself.","There seems to be a pattern. I get one good script every two years.","I know a lot of sad people who aren't comedians.","I didn't want to be a comedian. I wanted to be an actor - maybe a comic actor, but a real actor - by real, I mean not a comedian. I wanted to be an actor.","I said something really stupid once. I told a friend that my mother was so beautiful, but my dad was ugly. My dad heard it and just laughed it off, but I felt guilty. It haunted me for years. I should never have said that.","I was a milksop as a kid. I had no confidence, no guts. I felt I was going to be someone else someday - someone who didn't have my weaknesses.","I've become pretty philosophical about a lot of things, including death. It doesn't get to me.","When you fall in love, and you're very young, you think that that's the love of your life. And maybe it is, but it usually doesn't turn out that way.","I live in a small town in Connecticut, and they don't write scripts there, but I get them anyway because my agent is in Los Angeles.","I feel alone and safe in public.","I don't want to do 'Hamlet.' I don't want to do Robert Redford roles or Mel Gibson roles or Kevin Costner roles, because I'm not going to be good at them.","If there's an audience, I think they're going to expect me to be funny. But what if I'm not funny? What if I fail?","Whatever simplicity I've achieved in writing, I think I owe most of it to Jean Renoir and Hemingway: simple, declarative sentences. I've read some very good writers, but the sentences were so long that I've forgotten what the point was.","I've read everything printed in English that Freud has written. It helped me a great deal."],"Gene Wolfe":["Knowledge is soon changed, then lost in the mist, an echo half-heard.","A youthful American voice isn't particularly challenging - I've been a young American, and they're all around me. I can walk from my house to Barrington High School.","Ambiguity is necessary in some of my stories, not in all. In those, it certainly contributes to the richness of the story. I doubt that thematic closure is never attainable.","He's not rewarding us by talking to us. He's talking to us because He has something to say to us directly, as opposed to the things He says to all humanity.","I don't think anyone is more intrinsically holy. People experience God in many ways; and it seems to me that God does what the rest of us do: He chooses the means that best gets His message across.","I have read only the first 'Harry Potter' book. I thought it excellent, perhaps the best thing written for older children since The Hobbit. I wish the books had been around when my kids were the right age for them.","My whole life experience feeds into my writing. I think that must be true for every writer. Clearly the Army and combat were major influences; just the same, you need to understand that many of the writers we have now couldn't load a revolver.","Online publication is fine with me, in part because I hope to collect those stories later.","Whether the medium is ready for consumers is better judged by those consumers. I sometimes read online - but not often. The stigma is attached to pay scales. Much online publication is no pay or small pay.","You seem to think that the only genuine existence evil can have is conscious existence - that no one is evil unless he admits it to himself. I disagree."],"Genelia D'Souza":["When in doubt, always opt for going naturel rather than hiding your skin under foundation and such. Line your eyes with kohl and mascara, put on some bright lip gloss and pinch your cheeks a little bit to get them all flushed and bright!","At home, a T-shirt and something loose like harem pants would do. If I'm stepping out, a pair of blue jeans and a white tee are just fine.","I don't see a difference between the big screen and the small one. We are entertainers, and the medium doesn't matter.","Every role I do is a dream role for me because I can't imagine I'm doing it.","I eat egg whites a lot. Aside from that, I eat everything. I try to avoid too much oily food, but I do eat carbs. I have to have a balanced diet.","I'm an athlete, so I can get up one day and run and it wouldn't bother me. I don't get the time because I work for long hours every day. Being constantly on the move itself helps me stay fit. I don't go to a gym. I use the stairs, not the lift. I'm not into fitness, but I feel I should start, as it's healthy.","No doubt, my role in 'Urumi' has been one of my best so far. It surprised me as an actor and made me more confident.","Following 'Urumi,' I did get a lot of offers from Malayalam, but frankly, managing films in several industries can become a little hectic. So I decided not to take them up.","I'm a fast and impatient dresser, so I can't dress myself up for too long. I don't even need a lot of makeup, so I'm usually ready in about half an hour.","Considering the regular use of make-up and the fact that I'm under the glare of the harsh shooting lights practically all the time, I'm adamant about using really strong cleansing milk to get the make-up off my skin, and I never sleep with make-up on, however tired I am.","When it comes to make-up, I usually go au natural most of the time and opt for a basic blush, lip gloss and kohl for a day look.","What a lot of people don't realise is that damage to hair starts from washing your hair in a rush and not taking all the product out such as leave-in conditioners. So I always make sure that I cleanse my hair properly and get the shampoo and conditioner completely out.","There is a general notion that playing a bubbly girl is undemanding and less challenging. But that's not the case. You need oodles of energy to bring out the spirit of a lively character. Besides, no two bubbly girls are the same. Every character I have played is different from the other. I love being chosen for such lively roles.","As far as my projects are concerned, I have always maintained a healthy balance. My south Indian projects have never taken a backseat even though I've been busy in Hindi. Both regions have loved me, and being wanted by both the north and south film industries is a compliment by itself."],"Genesis Rodriguez":["I don't really care if people think I'm good-looking or not; it doesn't define me as a person.","Making a fool out of yourself and putting it on the Internet is one of the best bonding experiences you could have.","I really want to keep on opening doors for myself, and others who want to come in.","Being by the ocean is the greatest thing.","I love Miami; I miss it so much. I miss the beach, the peace it brings you. I love the sound and smell of the sea.","I love to talk about sports. I love sports; it's just something that's in my nature.","Every woman needs a girls' night out.","I think I'm representing a new generation of Latinos - bilingual, bicultural people.","I would love to do film in Spanish.","I really like the risk takers. I like people who make those different choices on the carpet. I really like Charlize Theron. I think she's elegant and edgy as well. I love Zoe Saldana.","I'd rather just be the girl who likes to eat a lot of food.","I like when a guy has his shirt off and I can see his chest and his abs. When it's all smooth, you can see a lot.","Girls like to see a guy who takes care of himself. It says a lot about him.","Girls really like for doors to be opened for them. Guys should really remember that.","I could never date a guy with a pet snake.","Every guy should have a fantasy sports team.","I'm so excited about 'Identity Thief'. It's such a good comedy, and I'm excited for people to go out and see it!","In novelas, sometimes you get the most ridiculous situations, but you make the best of it. But novelas are a very special genre.","My character in 'Casa de mi Padre' is an ambitious woman. I had never played that kind of character before.","I knew what kind of genre 'Casa de mi Padre' was going for. But my character, specifically, I think is very real.","I don't have an idol per se.","If I could do anything, I'd be an engineer of some sort. I used to build robots.","Latinos are very passionate, and they perform a lot, and look at me, I'm talking with my hands, and this is just my normal self, so it kind of allows me to be who I am and not dumb it down.","If this acting thing doesn't work, I'd just put in my resume for NBA.com. I'm a really huge basketball fan... I'll talk all sorts of trash.","I'm bicultural, and everyone sees me as a Latina, but in my head I see myself as both Latina and American.","It's very important to me that people see I am an American and I was born in the States.","I've never given myself a nickname.","I know I can't eat whatever I want and look the way I want, so you need to work for it. I give credit to Pilates and my parents' good genes.","I am living my dream every day."],"Geneva Carr":["I'm living the dream! I just want to tell actors and writers it's never too late, and it can happen when you least expect it.","Commercials are art, too; they're 30-second movies starring people like me. If you look down on the medium, you're never going to book. If you don't love it, do not bother. Find another job you like.","I'm so grateful for where I am now, but I think I'm more grateful because it's been so hard-won; I haven't given up, and I've had plenty of reasons to give up.","I saw a play in a black box theatre, and it changed my life.","It ain't over at 40. I haven't crested the best part of my career.","The first thing I say when someone says they want to be an actor is, 'Go get 'Backstage.' You know what's going on, you know who's doing what, and there's work that you can find in there. It's an incredible resource, and there's nothing else like it.","I'm a Southern girl, and I like to put a good face on everything.","I've lived in 11 states, but I'm not an Army brat. My father couldn't hold a job, so every six months, we'd move.","I'm sort of a Southerner because those are my roots, but my parents are from Iowa.","My husband and I met on OKCupid. We went out on our little coffee date, and I knew right away he was my husband. He's a handsome, smarty-pants architect from Tokyo. On our first date, I said, 'I wake up like this. I'm Pollyanna Sunshine, and I'm not for everyone'.","I don't come from an artistic family, so I didn't know what theater was. I was working on Wall Street in the '90s, and I went to see 'Appointment With a High-Wire Lady' at Ensemble Studio Theatre, and it affected me so deeply. It changed everything I thought about the arts. I quit banking and became an actor.","I think 'Hand to God' is going to change the landscape of Broadway. I think Broadway, truthfully, will never be the same.","Let me tell you a little secret: There are no bad actors. There are none. You have to find the right role. I never give up on people. For God's sake, look at me.","I like visceral writing that people can't help but respond to, even if they respond, and they're shocked, or they're angry, or they're offended. I think that's the only way to reach people.","I think I'm going to do a workout tape called 'Hand to God to Abs of Steel.'"],"Genevieve Bujold":["I confess it, I love the camera. When it's not on me, I'm not quite alive.","I don't like to intellectualize about my acting.","I don't sit around and study the pages of a script over and over again.","I don't worry whether the period is contemporary or three hundred years ago. Human beings are all alike.","The main thing in acting is honesty, to feel the humanity and get to the essence of the character. You can't put anything into a character that you haven't got within you.","I don't like to intellectualize about my acting. I don't sit around and study the pages of a script over and over again."],"Genevieve Gorder":["And the relationships that happen become so intense, deep, involved and complex and really hard to say goodbye to. The hardest part of the show is saying goodbye when it's all done. It really breaks you.","Design can have such a positive impact on the way people live and on their relationships and moods.","You need to have a home to go back to, whether it's a hotel room or a barn. It's only home when he's there.","I had the idea for the show like a year and a half, two years ago. And it was all about the things that I didn't like about TV. I was trying to create a positive solution for it. And it actually worked.","It's about the power of design and the power of the human spirit. It's above paying anybody to do something stupid for money like reality television does - like ambushing people.","So, to really execute design in its highest form and making people feel joy, that's a great reward.","The birth of any show is always a rough one.","But instead of that stuff you get relationships with people and neighbors that you would never get in a city. People in small towns are a lot more open.","Like I said, TLC has enough of my life. I have to keep some of it for myself.","I think taking design out of the studio and really having a relationship with the people that you're making it for really convinced me of how powerful a thing design is. It's not just an aesthetic decoration.","There's a big difference between decorators and designers and the training is very different.","I had been to the South many times and I thought I knew what the South was, but not until you live with people and live through their lives do you know what it's really about.","I think we typically, as Northerners, stereotype what the South is in so many negative ways. We kind of forget all the beautiful things that they contribute to make this country a country.","I think that, in comparison, New Yorkers and Northerners are so guarded.","So, like I said, I will visit Jeffersonville more often because I now have a little getaway house up there.","Being on Oprah? You realize that there are a couple of types of audience members. There are like the cult people in the audience who are just crying before she gets on. And then there are the people who are playing it cool. I definitely was somewhere in the middle.","I'm so used to talk-show hosts just giving you a sound bite and not really being interested.","Oprah has this intense curiosity that I haven't found with any interviewer.","I'm opening a store at the end of the month in the New York meatpacking district. I'm launching a line of bedding this summer, and I am writing a book that will be out next January.","That was always my frustration with so many of these shows, because design is not an ambush... it's a relationship. You have to know how people move and live and work to be able to design for them.","We worked out a lot of bugs and figured out who was working and who wasn't and how this beast functions. It was a lot bigger than we actually thought, and now we have a well-run ship where it feels I can actually have time to imagine and not just stress out about everything.","I will not do work that isn't done well or right. Stuff happens - things break, contractors don't come through - but I don't want to be responsible for not doing something correctly.","I'm a designer, I love it, and I haven't worked this hard to do bad work.","You forget how many people watch TV until you come into a town like this. Everybody knows you, and I'm always humbled, especially when there are 500 little kids who all have their hair done like yours and want to be designers.","The Deep South has a completely different history, both good and bad, that is fascinating for everybody. It makes people work together who usually don't, and that sounds like a cliche in so many ways, but it actually happened... and it happened because of a beautiful idea.","It's not about doing over the living room of someone who has bad taste in color. This is about restoring historic buildings and instilling pride in a community, which can be done through designing new public spaces and social gathering spots."],"Genevieve O'Reilly":["I'm not sure I'm a good cook. But I like cooking, and it's a real family thing - an expression of love being together.","I love going away with friends - it gets a bit raucous and fun.","I think most Irish people are creative. Whether it's music, or dance, or... certainly storytelling is in the blood.","I'm a bit of a mongrel, really!","There's such a fascination with celebrity. I think that's a very different thing to being an actor.","I've had quite a wide spread of a career. But it's not like I've had to negotiate what Sienna Miller has had to negotiate, or even Felicity Jones, for example.","My goal has always been, from the time I was at drama school, about longevity.","Certainly in my youth there was lots of singing, lots of storytelling, and whenever we went to a party, you had to do a party piece, like sing songs, recite poems, or tell stories. That sort of narrative musical culture was my upbringing.","When I was around 13 or 14, there were visits to the theater, which really ignited my passion. Going to see live theater is when I properly got the bug and hoped I'd be able to do it for a living one day.","Whenever I do a play, there are 'Star Wars' fans at the stage door, and they're always lovely - so excited and so effusive about the storylines and the characters. When you're doing something really serious, and the 'Star Wars' fans are waiting outside, it's a nice juxtaposition.","I used to have an Australian accent for school and an Irish accent for home.","I was the only one silly enough to carry it on to the professional level, but I would say most of my family - and my extended family - are storytellers. And really, that's just what acting is.","It's great to have a job and then go to another one, and have another one to go to after that. It doesn't always happen; you might be waiting a few months. But I've had some interesting roles, and worked with some great people. And it has been a really interesting mix between theatre television and film.","Isn't everybody a 'Star Wars' fan?","I have a few homes. I have my family home in Adelaide where my parents and my brothers and sisters are, and I have a few friends and my place where I used to live in Sydney, and then my husband and our family in London, so... I'm from everywhere and nowhere.","I'm a working actor, and that's what I always wanted.","I love Adelaide. It's a great place.","I think there's a responsibility to any character that you play that was a living persona.","We used to speak Irish - Gaelic Irish - around the dinner table, but over the years, we lost that.","I think moving from Ireland to Australia, you couldn't get a more different accent on the palate. The Irish accent is very muscular and involves a lot of tongue and cheek-muscle work, whereas the Australian accent is really flat; the palate is quite broad. They're at almost opposite ends of the scale, so I feel it was good training.","What's that comment about every actor being a waiter who is out of a job? I did a lot of waitressing, and I loved it because I love getting to know people from different places.","Me and my husband make decisions together, and we think of the children always, as a lot of jobs take you away as an actor, and it's a bit of a gypsy lifestyle.","All of my dad's family, his brothers and sisters, my nana and grandad and all of the cousins emigrated to Australia within two years of each other. Irish families are close at the best of times, but when you move to the other side of the world, we were like a big posse over there.","I think there are lots of reasons to take projects. Being scared about one is always good.","It's not difficult to be attracted to Rupert Penry-Jones."],"Genevieve Padalecki":["I have some cool talents. I'm really flexible and can do all sorts of twisted yoga positions. And I'm a big athlete and especially love soccer.","I love the possibility that anything can happen in any moment with acting. That you have the opportunity to experience lives and adventures that you may not have otherwise.","My biggest thing is, I'm learning what it's like to carry myself in a personal way and also a professional way: how I can be a leader and do multitasking.","I use circumlocution too often, and instead of getting my point across, I tend to babble."],"Genevieve Valentine":["I will always have a soft spot for 'East of the Sun, West of the Moon,' which I discovered just at the age when I was beginning to enjoy the darkness in fairy tales but still wanted a story where the good guys win.","Most of my writing takes place at a cramped desk in a cramped apartment, so whenever I get to write on a train or make notes on a road trip, it has an entirely different cadence. And I can remember specific writing sessions while on a train through beautiful countryside in a way I can remember almost nothing else.","The ways in which language changes never ceases to interest me."],"Genie Francis":["There is something else at work here that is beyond me - and that is Laura. She has a life of her own. There is a magic in her. The muse is in her. And I'm lucky to have her in my life.","I have never, ever, had an acting partnership that was a safe, as full, and as exciting as the one I had with Tony. I didn't want to go through life without having a chance to taste it again.","The pleasant surprise for me is that when I look into Tony's eyes, he's still 100% present, sharing everything that's going on. Acting with him is like a beautiful dance.","I felt for a while with the GH appearances, they were kind of using me as a media trick, bringing me on for three or four weeks, saying I was back on the show, but not really writing for me. And then I would be gone. I just didn't like that anymore. I guess it was me putting my foot down.","What I have found is that my fan base will follow me to whatever I'm doing. They gave me a big tune-in for Hallmark. They were just happy to see me working again, and my job is not to disappoint them, not to cheat them.","I have an appearance on a new TV show called 'Bar Karma' on Current TV. I had the most fun ever making this episode. I play someone with a multiple personality, and I think my fans will be surprised and get a real giggle out of it. It's a new model for TV in that it is interactive with the community.","My heart goes out to the Lindsay Lohans and Britneys who have really had childhood taken from them and probably missed important developmental steps. They have become sort of 'public domain' and something to be made money on. There's no sense of self there, I'm sure of it.","From the time I was 16 and I had my own checking account, you'd think most young women would run out and buy clothes. No, I ran out and got myself a psychiatrist!","I've always loved interior design.","Being a wife and a mother is very gratifying, but it's not a creative expression and that's something I need to be happy.","I remember being in Atlantic City once when I was 18 or 19, and a sea of people were screaming and pulling their hair because I was there. It was weird. Nobody deserves adulation like that. I tried to explain it to my kids once. I said, 'Mommy used to be kind of cool, kind of like a Britney Spears.'","Most of my actor friends don't believe it's possible to let go of it and be happy, and for a while that was true for me. For the first two years I ached, every day. And I had such bad dreams. But then I made the decision to start working on my little shop and all that went away.","A lot of actors think they can't be happy without the acting... But I think I couldn't be happy with it anymore.","It's nice to come back for visits. 'General Hospital' is my home.","I would stay on, but 'General Hospital' honestly doesn't seem to want that relationship with this character at the moment. They want little short doses during sweeps periods."],"Gennady Timchenko":["China is an area where we need to be present. Lots of companies want to supply their products to China.","Western media present events in Russia in a thoroughly negative light. Yes, we have problems, and these need to be covered. But the fact remains that there is a propaganda campaign being waged against Russia. And this is disturbing.","I have never concealed my dual citizenship. People involved in state business should probably declare their dual citizenship if they have it."],"Gennifer Flowers":["I don't know Bill Clinton as someone who needs to literally sexually harass a woman. I'm sure that he could have found many willing participants.","I don't think Bill is a role model for anyone.","I'm a sexually liberated woman that earned that liberation. I am very proud of the fact that I feel comfortable in certain forums discussing sex.","I met Bill Clinton in 1977 while I was working as a news reporter for KARK-TV in Little Rock, Arkansas. Shortly after we met, we began a sexual relationship that lasted for twelve years.","On several occasions, I discussed with Bill Clinton the subject of inquiries by the media about our relationship. He told me to continue to deny our relationship, that if we would stick together, everything would be okay.","I don't have any interest whatsoever in getting back out there and bashing Hillary Clinton.","I feel like I have a Ph.D. in life, I'm a survivor. I've not only survived, I've thrived.","I've always believed everything was about protecting the Clinton power structure and anyone would be sacrificed who got in the way of that.","I've had a face-lift. I've had my eyes done; liposuction; the nose job - well, that was a long time ago.","I'm a married woman. I love my husband; I have a good life.","My advice to Hillary would be to divorce that chump.","Let me tell you this, if I had wanted to have a library of audio and videotapes of Bill Clinton, I could have had that. And after I was accused of being a liar, I wished that I had of.","People used to ask me: 'Well, was it the power that attracted you to Bill Clinton?' And I said, well, how much power do you think the attorney general of Arkansas has? Of course not. It wasn't that for me. I just a thought he was wonderful in general.","I think that Bill and Hillary Clinton have a very special relationship and I think in very many ways to them it's a very satisfying relationship. I think that it's a mutual respect with a goal of power to achieve, maintain power. And I think that they have been good partners in that.","I have never lied about my relationship with Bill Clinton. The only proven liar, at this point, and the only admitted liar, is Bill Clinton; not Gennifer Flowers, not Kathleen Willey, not Paula Jones and not Monica Lewinsky, at this point. He is the only proven liar."],"Genzebe Dibaba":["I already have natural speed, which I don't need to work on, so in training I've been working more on my endurance.","The 1500 m. record was considered impossible to break.","It's amazing - 2015 has been a fantastic year for me because of the records I've broken and the wins I've had.","I damaged my hamstring at the London Olympics and had to stop training for five months. At times, I thought my career was over.","An athlete may not know what they're putting in their body.","I'm the first from Ethiopia getting 1500-meter world record; that is amazing.","It feels so good to be the World Athlete of the Year.","Even when I'm back home, I find the flat parts of the course tougher. Because it's flat, I feel it more in my knees.","I used to win at school, and some teacher said to me, 'Why don't you take up running like your sisters?'","I've worked hard to get here; I would like to thank all the people who helped me.","I want to do just like my sister, if not even better.","I wanted to train more for the outdoor season than the indoor season, so I changed my training totally.","I have been dreaming of an outdoor world record forever. Now I want them all: the 1500, the 5000, even the 800.","Everybody expects me to win the gold medal.","Everyone is getting prepared for this, to win the gold medal. I am among them: I want to win the medal.","My dream is to get gold medal both in the world championship and the Olympics.","I had a great season and truly enjoyed competing around the world - from Monaco, where I managed to establish a world record, to Beijing, where I finally captured my first world outdoor title.","My focus in 2016 will be the IAAF World Indoor Championships in Portland, and as preparation for that, I will try to break the world indoor mile record in Stockholm on February 17.","Usually, it is not difficult to change from indoors to outdoors.","I find outdoors easier than indoors, but I am more interested in indoor athletics. I prefer it because it is hotter indoors, and I like the shorter laps.","I train mainly with guys, and they help to push me."],"Geoff Davis":["I'm very confident that the solutions that we are developing are going to be effective not only in application in Iraq, but also will be very helpful for potential homeland security situations as well.","Our all-volunteer force continues to prove itself with a great level of professionalism, personal commitment and a technical competence that is quite remarkable.","This campaign was special because we always kept the challenger mentality we had from the start. We managed to keep the against-all-odds, can-do spirit that kept us going when no one thought we could win.","You know that I am living proof that the American Dream is real. Growing up, our congressman cut through government bureaucratic red tape to help my mom buy our first house. That's the kind of congressman I'll be.","Two million dollars is only small when you're talking about Washington, D.C.","What I want to do is create more taxpayers, not more taxes.","Heritage Action is a self-interested fundraising organization led by a former Giuliani staffer who is not taking counsel from real conservatives... It is a worthless organization to the conservative movement. I'll be the first to say that.","I went through some real challenges growing up. I joined the Army two weeks out of high school when I was 17, and never looked back.","Ayman Zawahiri, Osama bin Laden's deputy, as well as Abu Musab Zarqawi, have made it quite clear in their internal propaganda that they cannot win unless they can drive the Americans out. And they know that they can't do that there, so they've brought the battlefield to the halls of Congress.","The sheer magnitude of Speaker Pelosi's spending spree is mind boggling. Most of us do not use the number 1,000,000,000,000 in our daily lives, so it is difficult to attach tangible value to the figure.","One of the simplest ways to get an idea of one trillion dollars is to consider the amount in terms of the passage of time. One million seconds is equal to roughly eleven days and twelve hours, and one billion seconds is thirty-two years. One trillion seconds equals thirty-two thousand years.","The American people know that we cannot spend our way to prosperity.","Stimulus spending, permanent bailouts, government takeovers, and federal mandates have all failed our nation. America's employers are afraid to invest in an economy racked with uncertainty over what Washington's next set of rules, regulations, mandates, and tax hikes will look like.","The sooner we rein in the red tape factory in Washington, D.C., the sooner small businesses can get back to creating jobs and helping more Americans find an honest day's work."],"Geoff Downes":["We have always tried to treat every album differently and even from day one I think that each Asia album has been approached with care and thought and hopefully that shines through twenty years later.","Ironically I think this is what sparked my interest in and passion for the NOAH, which is capable of creating all these old weird and wonderful sounds.","Just the actual physics of putting it all together, you know, the latter period is actually quite fragmented in terms of the licenses and all those things so it makes a compilation of the full twenty years really a technical minefield.","Still, we view that old material very much like we view the new material so if this gives us a chance to go out and promote it then, yes we will go out and do that.","The Buggles was much more a studio environment idea, which we never actually took on the road.","Well, I think that it is complicated in that the first four albums were all with Universal so they have the rights to that and therefore it is a lot easier for them to do that period.","With NOAH, you can create some stunning, yet original soundscapes. Therefore, as a performance tool, it really comes into its own because you can make one single performance which has a lot of detail.","To some degree. I think that I've always been very much of a chordal person. The chords are the foundation of everything. Some of Yes' stuff is very linear, albeit complex, but it's single-line melodic stuff. So I kind of had to wear a different cap working with Yes. It's not so much chord-based.","Styx has their own style of music, and I think that's justifiable, the same way that Asia and Yes have had - Yes particularly has a unique style that seems to have transcended all styles of music for 43 years.","I think that Yes' music is kind of on its own out there, and it goes through different chapters, and that involves different people. I don't think it's a case of 'any year is better than any other.' They can all co-exist quite comfortably.","I think when you follow a band, you're following a - and I don't like to use the term 'brand,' but you are following a kind of style, if you like. So I think you have to accept that there will be different people involved from time to time.","I've always been fascinated with the juxtaposition of technology in music, not only in recording, but in the keyboard. It's amazing the way you can apply technology to an art form.","Now with Pro Tools, you can play with layers and 100s and 100s of tracks. When we used to do it back in the day, you had one shot, or you would have to wipe it and carry on over that track."],"Geoff Dyer":["I think I got into travelling because it was so not in my blood, so against my tendency to just stay put because my dad just hated going on holidays, because, as I've said in many essays, the thing that he hated more than anything else in life was spending money. And as soon as you leave your home, you're spending money.","There's one profound difference between secular and religious pilgrimages. It's inconceivable that a Muslim would feel a sense of anticlimax when reaching Mecca. But for a secular pilgrim, the potential for disappointment is always there.","I love festivals, period.","If you're not religious, like me, how do you explain the transformational power that certain places have? They bring an incredible degree of attention to where you are and the passage of time. You're looking at every flower twitching, wondering if it's just the breeze or some magical pulse.","Have you ever stayed at the Four Seasons Hotel in Mumbai? I'd warmly recommend it. It's super luxurious, and right next door, there's a classic slum. So you can do a quick slum tour and get back to your sanctuary without any inconvenience but with some excellent snaps.","There's something awful about Oxford, I think. It's such a little ghetto.","There are the tears of rage when books get praised when they're so obviously garbage. But then there are so many more that continue to move me: the end of 'Paradise Lost,' 'The Ruined Cottage' by Wordsworth, Prospero's 'Our revels now are ended' speech near the end of 'The Tempest.'","I don't read 'genre' fiction if that means novels with lots of killing and shooting. Even Cormac McCarthy's 'No Country for Old Men' seemed pretty childish in that regard.","In history books, or the one about the guy who cut his hand off to get out of a canyon in Utah, you really want them to be accurate. But my stuff is such small beer by comparison.","The lesson of travel seems to be so banal, but so great, which is that people are just so amazingly decent the world over. Given the disparity of income and wealth, it's amazing not just that you don't get robbed everywhere - it's amazing you don't get eaten.","I think I do have a sort of terrible propensity for boredom and for being bored, even though I am absolutely of the opinion that one shouldn't be bored and that there is no excuse for it and that it is a personal failing.","When I'm writing, quite often I start having a good time when I see there's a chance to make myself look like a real jerk. I start chuckling and having an interesting, rather than a boring, time.","Now, instead of loading up your jalopy and heading for California, you take a second, badly paid job; 'The Grapes of Wrath' has turned into 'Nickel and Dimed.'","Once you've got through immigration, one is always made to feel very welcome in America, once they've let you in. It's a great place to be.","In terms of behaving in a civic way, I feel my behavior is always exemplary.","It really doesn't matter if it happened exactly how I say it happened.","I didn't get on a plane until I was 23, after I left Oxford and was teaching at Lucy Clayton Secretarial College in London.","People never read my books for the quality of the documentary value.","I could never write a book where the point-of-view character was a short person, because I just can't imagine what that's like.","I do understand my limitations as a fiction writer, which is why my novels are always going to be close to home.","When I started writing, the deal was that publishers gave you a grand or two as an advance to buy some sweets, with the promise that they would make a big putsch with your fourth book when you'd built up a bit of a following. But by the time my fourth book came out, previously unpublished authors were the new big thing.","If you just take me as a fiction writer, then you're probably going to find me fairly limited.","I am still moved by passages of Marx: the 'Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right,' for example, where, after the famous line about religion being 'the opium of the people,' he goes on to call it 'the heart of a heartless world.'","I didn't read much of anything till I was 15, except Alistair MacLean and Michael Moorcock - the sword and sorcery novels - when I was about 13 or 14.","I'm as strong and supple as a pane of thin glass. I've got too many ailments - left shoulder, left elbow and left wrist - in fact, the whole of the left arm.","I'm incredibly competitive in all sports in a way that is so mystifying to my wife because she grew up playing the violin and piano. I've always been like that.","I really like to win at sport.","I'm never happier when writing than when I see gags taking shape - ideally, gags at my own expense. What I like is the shuttling back and forth, serious into comedy and vice-versa, ideally, both in the same sentence, or even simultaneously. The best jokes are always ideas in miniature.","I have this long-running idea that the distinction between fiction and nonfiction is not just, 'Did it happen or didn't it happen?' It's one of form.","I feel that form determines how readers read a book and how they judge it.","I remember being interviewed about my first novel, 'The Colour of Memory.' They kept using the expression 'your first novel,' and I said, 'No, I object to that phrase, because this is it for me.'","While writing, I'm always so happy in the middle of a book or finishing a book and really hate starting them, so I often think, 'I wish I had a really big book to write to which I could devote seven years of my life.'","It doesn't require much thought for one to realise that any travel book worthy of the name has to be a departure from the standard idea of the form.","I first got a sense of that idea of nodality - but I didn't use the word back then - with 'The Missing of the Somme': that sense of a particular place in a landscape or on a map having some kind of tremendous power to draw us to itself... that made me conscious, and since then, really, it has been an abiding concern of mine.","I think that if you are a resolute, unswerving atheist, you have that sense that you are conscious of the God-shaped hole that has been left in the wake of any religious belief, and in a way, one is much more drawn to articulate why it is that certain places, or certain experiences, have a kind of power.","The devastating scale and frequency of my disappointment was proof of how much I still expected and wanted from the world, of what high hopes I still had for it.","Stories don't interest me.","It would be nice to turn off that incessant churning of consciousness.","I think I can recognize when a piece is at a state of completion.","I've never been much drawn towards satire of any kind.","Earnest people are always a bit on the thick side in my experience.","Writing, for me, has always been a way of not having a career.","What I've really liked doing is combining what you might call art criticism or music criticism with something that is happening in real life.","It's funny, because people always say when they meet me, having read me - or they read me, having met me - that they are struck by how the tone is pretty similar, in real life and in the books.","Generally, I'm not anti the novel.","My reading of serious books about serious music is seriously compromised by the way that I can't understand any musical theory. Any mentions of D major or C minor are meaningless to me.","I've always had this belief that you want to write about universal truths.","One of the things I've really come to realise is that the chances of arriving at a universal truth are increased if you remain absolutely faithful to the contingencies of your own experience and the vagaries of your own nature.","Sharing a room with one person is worse than sharing with six, and sharing with six is in some ways worse than sharing with sixty.","The essence of my character is an inability to get used to things. This, in fact, is the one thing I have grown accustomed to: an inability to get used to things.","As soon as I hear that there's something to get used to, I know that I won't; I sort of pledge myself to not getting used to it.","You read 'Stalingrad' by Antony Beevor because you're interested in the Second World War or Russia or whatever.","I guess, when I left university, I liked the idea of being a writer, and I thought then that being a writer really meant that you were a novelist. But if one of the impulses for being a novelist is wanting to be a storyteller, I never had any urge to tell stories.","We have in our heads a pretty well-defined narrative of the First World War, and there are certain events that are obviously key.","First, unreliability is not the sole preserve of fictional narrators. Second, the pleasure of patting oneself on the back for seizing on instances of unreliability and ignorance is, as the late Frank Kermode may or may not have pointed out, considerable.","One of the great privileges of my life was growing up in a house without books.","Contrary to popular belief, Oxford has the highest concentration of dull-witted, stupid, narrow-minded people anywhere in the British Isles.","The person doing the learning is the person writing the book as much as the person reading it.","I'll be writing essays long after I've stopped writing fiction. There is this unusually broad range in the non-fiction, but if you look at what I'm capable of as a novelist, I'm more limited.","The only thing that changes in my novels are the locations.","Once you've published a few books, you drag around this ball and chain of a back list. All the evidence of how few you've sold is there. I think a lot of writers my age have this strange experience of going from would-be to has-been.","For me, those little cinemas in Paris where I saw many art films for the first time meant that cinema became a kind of pilgrimage site.","The business of taking a book and transforming into a script to make this thing called a film - it's a mysterious process to me; sometimes it works.","In terms of target audience, who cares what a middle-aged guy like me wants; most mainstream are not catering to me at all.","I would probably, in my 60s, be ready to start having kids, as long as I was spared all the stuff about it that doesn't appeal to me. By then, I'd have lost interest in practically everything, so there'd be no opportunity cost involved.","My evangelical phase about Burning Man is well and truly in the past.","What I don't like is constructing a book that fits in with any kind of generic template, whether it's fiction or nonfiction.","We still go to nonfiction for content. And if it's well-written, that's a bonus. But we don't often talk about the nonfiction work of art. That's what I'm very interested in.","I've seen 'Stalker' more times than any film except 'The Great Escape.'","Physical violence is always a bore in films today. We don't see how much it hurts. We don't learn the true consequences of it.","The CGI landscape is another world. It has its own physical laws; it can defy gravity. But surely the wonder of cinematic space is that it is wedded to reality?","Making the ordinary potentially magical is what film should be all about.","The ritual of film-going in some sense replaced that of churchgoing, because you share something communal, sometimes mystical.","In the 1930s, photographers such as Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange produced images of sharecroppers and Okies, which drew attention both to the conditions in which these unfortunates found themselves and to their heroic fortitude.","While admiring the pleasing evidence of wealth, we become complicit in - or, at the very least, recognize the extent to which we, too, are beneficiaries of - an economic system we routinely deplore.","My Tarkovsky idolatry was at its peak, but 'Nostalghia' really didn't do anything for me. 'The Sacrifice' was similarly disappointing for me. Next thing we knew, he was dead.","In many ways, I was a typical young guy out of college. I was at Oxford, where every night there'd be a late showing of some great film.","I was studying English, as you will, in the day, and five nights a week, I would be at the cinema. That continued throughout my 20s, which was also the 1980s - there was a lot of really good films coming out then."],"Geoff Hoon":["My role is not to choose between safeguarding the economy and protecting the environment - it's about doing both.","Most people are flying to Heathrow because it's a hub, so they can fly on to other places, often long-distance flights. If they can't go on those long-distance flights from Heathrow, they will go to Paris, they will go to Amsterdam, they will go to Frankfurt, because those are viable alternatives.","Ministers regularly meet soldiers that have returned from operational tours to hear about their experiences, including those who have recovered from their injuries.","I lived at admiralty house from 2002 until 2006 on advice from special branch on security grounds as defence secretary. The alternative of providing comprehensive security at my personal property would have entailed significant extra costs to the taxpayer.","I need to maintain a home in Derbyshire and in London to be able both to represent my constituents and to fulfil my responsibilities as an MP and as a minister.","Despite my involvement in difficult and sometimes controversial questions I have received consistent support from the people of Ashfield. They have recognised that it is necessary to take difficult decisions, that newspapers do not always report fairly or accurately.","I have had many Ashfield people say to me that they might not agree with my political views or my decisions but that they supported my right to be heard.","I joined the Labour party because I believed in equality, in freedom of speech and in tolerance, compassion and understanding for people, irrespective of their background and views. In whatever I decide to do in the future I will hold to those principles.","I don't want to be a lobbyist. I want to provide strategic advice to companies. I said both of those things in the course of the interview, and I made clear this is a matter only for after I had become a private citizen and I was no longer a member of parliament.","I think anyone about to leave one job not surprisingly would use their knowledge, their experience, their skills drawn from their previous positions to try and earn a living in the future. That's what happens in all interviews.","We're investing record sums on buses and trains. We have a huge programme to encourage people to walk and cycle, and everyone up to and including the PM has been looking closely at how we can promote electric vehicles, hybrids, and other technologies.","During the last economic slowdown in the 1990s, the Tories slashed infrastructure investment. I am determined not to make that mistake.","The Chief Whip's job is trying to make sure that the Government - and MPs elected as part of the governing party - deliver the promises that they were elected on. That's a healthy part of the democratic process.","I drove 3,500 miles this summer on our family holiday, we drove across 10 countries. I have driven across the United States four times. I love cars, I love being in cars, I think so do most people. I want to help and support those people who have that same kind of enthusiasm for driving that I have."],"Geoff Johns":["Evil is relative - and what I mean by that is that our villains are as complex, as deep and as compelling as any of our heroes. Every antagonist in the DC Universe has a unique darkness, desire and drive. And the reason for being of 'Forever Evil' is to explore that darkness.","I think every writer doubts themselves, every day. You procrastinate because you're afraid. You're always afraid it's not going to be as good as you want it to be. But, the key is overcoming fear.","We are finding new areas in the ocean every day. It's as alien as going to outer space.","The truth is, we're all cyborgs with cell phones and online identities.","I've been writing 'Green Lantern' for a long time, and one of the reasons I've enjoyed it is because the depth of stories you can tell is pretty endless with space and everything.","Clearly, Simon Baz brings such a different viewpoint to 'Green Lantern.' The very nature of the corps concept of overcoming fear, I felt Simon was a great character to explore, while getting a different viewpoint on things.","The ocean is 90% unexplored. It's a great canvas to paint Aquaman stories across, just like Green Lantern has space. It's more organic, which makes it different and interesting. It's alien, but it's terrestrial.","I really explored self-awareness and emotions through 'Green Lantern.' It might sound goofy, but I do believe that emotions have power. We're all driven by something, and most of that is emotional reaction. For me, it was about recognizing my self-awareness.","Batman and the Flash have a whole lot in common behind the mask. They've both experienced loss, know forensic science, and are both a bit introverted. In 'Flashpoint,' Thomas Wayne thinks Barry is crazy, but Barry thinks Thomas is crazy. It'll be really fun seeing those two trying to figure things out.","I tend to like writing long stories in comics. I worked on 'Flash,' 'Teen Titans' and 'JSA' for years. I always like diving into characters.","I think evil is very relative.","'Forever Evil' is, ultimately, a Lex Luthor story. And everything in there is reflecting who Lex is and what he's going through. And we continue to learn more and more things about him that we might not know, and he's going to continue to experience things and do things that are surprising, I think, to even him - especially us.","I didn't want to take the DC universe, put it in a box, shake the box and pour it out. I wanted to take the major characters and show what they could be like if they were put on a different path.","The idea of introducing the Seven Seas is absolutely to challenge Aquaman on an emotional and personal level. His responsibility is unification of the world, and that just became a lot more complex when he learns about the fall of Atlantis and the splintering of the kingdoms.","Any character can find an audience and work if you have passion for that character. You might have to just scrape off the dirt and the barnacles and pull it out and highlight it.","The problem is there are so many stories out there where I can pull that superhero out, put any other superhero in, and the story works the same. For me, that's broken. I have to write a story that no one else but Aquaman or Shazam can be in, and as soon as you pull that character out and out someone else in, it doesn't work.","My sister was the inspiration for the character, the good qualities instilled in the character. The initial inspiration was there, but Stargirl has taken on a life of her own. She's her own character now.","I love every character in the DC universe, except for Rampage. Rampage is a She-Hulk rip-off, and I like She-Hulk.","As long as Green Lantern is still dealing with fear, it's going to be relevant. 'Rebirth' really grew out of 9/11. 9/11 happened, and then two years later, I was writing about fear. It was obviously connected.","I like collecting comics, I like buying comics, I like looking at comics, but I also read comics on digital readers, so any way people read comics is fine with me. Digital is just helping people who might not necessarily have access to comics help them; that's great.","One of the things that I thought really worked was that you have 'Smallville' on television and 'Superman Returns' come out in the theater, and it was fine. Nobody freaked out; nobody thought they were competing.","'The New 52,' I was really excited that new people got to jump in on books. In particular, on 'Aqua Man.'","I put my comics that are really valuable into regular mylar because I like to look at them. Once they're in those clam shell boxes, they're impossible to open up.","I love finding balance. My favorite thing to do is action-driven, emotionally-charged scenes.","The characters that have greys are the more interesting characters. The hero who sometimes crosses the line and the villain who sometimes doesn't are just much more interesting.","Greg Berlanti, Marc Guggenheim and Andrew Kreisberg are fantastic producers and showrunners, and they lead a very, very positive, fun, creative environment to work in and to work with.","I absolutely love Aquaman, and the character has been a passion since 'Blackest Night.'","Aquaman is one of the greatest characters at DC Comics and one of my favorites.","I think Aquaman feels - and deservedly so - like an A-list, premier DC hero. I hope that carries on; it certainly will carry over to Justice League.","Aquaman has the ability to be a huge character, and I think we really brought him to a new level in comic books, and I'm hoping that new level continues to everything that is DC Entertainment. Certainly, that's the goal. He's one of our most recognizable and most important characters, and it's going to continue to stay that way.","Every villain in the DC Universe wants something different, and not all of them want to rule the world. Or at least, not all of them want to rule the world in the way the Crime Syndicate do.","Deathstorm sees Power Ring as a fascinating experiment. Deathstorm is a scientist who's been merged with the dead body of his lab assistant. It's given him a cold demeanor and a clammy touch.","'Forever Evil' is my love letter to DC super villains. It's my chance to take all of the villains I've worked with and all the ones I've never worked with and put them into one gigantic, epic story that will bring together the bads of the DC Universe.","The Green Lanterns are very forward and very courageous, very forceful. The Red Lanterns are out of control, and they're not in their right mind because when we're angry or in rage, we say things and we do things we wouldn't normally do.","I am always a sucker for the underdogs. I love Batman and Superman, but when it comes to the guys who don't stand in the front of the line, Aquaman is one of the key guys for me. He's so much fun to work on.","I think supporting casts in comics are missing. I think a lot of the time in comics, all we have are people in costumes talking to other people in costumes, superheroes talking to superheroes and supervillains, and that's it.","'Flashpoint' is a showcase to demonstrate why the Flash is a major character, just like how we've done with Green Lantern. It's important that the Flash can hold his own.","I'm really proud of all the stuff we've built with Green Lantern - from Larfleeze to the different corps. The universe has expanded and will live well past my run. It was more than just telling another story, but really giving back to the character by expanding and adding to their mythology.","Everyone knows Aquaman, probably from all the animation he's been in over the years from the '70s and the '80s, entering him into the pop culture.","I don't know who made the first Aquaman joke. I'm sure it was comics readers; maybe we all did. But it's the idea that the perpetuated story of Aquaman is that he only has powers in water, and he talks to fish. I think it's the idea of him in the middle of a city just doesn't make a lot of sense to people. It's just the character itself.","'Justice League' takes place in the past, and Aquaman has a lot more to prove. He's just starting out. The perception is already beginning, and all these super humans are just showing up, and here's Aquaman. The perception is, 'What's next? Now we've got a guy talking to fish. What can be next?'","The thing about Green Lantern rings is they pick whoever has potential to overcome great fear.","There's a famous tension between Green Lantern and Green Arrow in the comic books. Those guys have always been friends. They started off as not on the same page, and then they quickly became best friends.","I love Captain Cold. I have him on my door at the office. He's grounded; he doesn't want to rule the world. He's not necessarily driven by ego, which a lot of villains are.","The DC Universe has the best villains in fiction, right? I don't think there's any group of villains collectively or anywhere else that come close to DC's. Joker, Cat Woman, Lex Luthor, are all staples. A lot of the comic book icons are fiction icons."],"Geoff Mulgan":["As the Internet of things advances, the very notion of a clear dividing line between reality and virtual reality becomes blurred, sometimes in creative ways.","All of nationalism can be understood as a kind of collective narcissism.","L'Oreal's slogan 'because you're worth it' has come to epitomise banal narcissism of early 21st century capitalism; easy indulgence and effortless self-love all available at a flick of the credit card.","So is civil society prepared for the future? Probably not. Most organisations have to live hand to mouth, juggling short-term funding and perpetual minor crises. Even the bigger ones rarely get much time to stand back and look at the bigger picture. Many are on a treadmill chasing after contracts and new funding.","Conflicts are never caused in any simple way by identity, culture or economics. Where resources are scarce, or there are strong historical memories of conflict, small events are more likely to inflame passions.","A tablet replacing an exercise book is not innovation, it's just a different way to make notes.","There is incredible potential for digital technology in and beyond the classroom, but it is vital to rethink how learning is organised if we are to reap the rewards.","The responsibility for good government lies not just with governments themselves but also with every other part of the system they operate in, including media, non-governmental organisations and the public.","Computing should be taught as a rigorous - but fun - discipline covering topics like programming, database structures, and algorithms. That doesn't have to be boring.","A modest dose of self-love is entirely healthy - who would want to live in a world where everyone hated themselves? But taken too far, it soon becomes poisonous.","People don't want charities to usurp the state as the core provider of social services.","The classic think-tank is supposed to be sitting in an attic thinking up grand ideas.","Science is, rightly, searching for drugs to arrest ageing or to slow the advance of dementia. But the evidence suggests that many of the most powerful factors determining how you age come from what you do, and what you do with others: whether you work, whether you play music, whether you have regular visitors.","Social innovation thrives on collaboration; on doing things with others, rather than just to them or for them: hence the great interest in new ways of using the web to 'crowdsource' ideas, or the many experiments involving users in designing services.","There is a yearning for people to return to elementary moral virtues, such as integrity and commitment. We distrust people who have no centering of values. We greatly respect businessmen, for example, if they display those virtues, even if we don't necessarily agree with the people.","All over the world, social innovation is tackling some of the most pressing problems facing society today - from fair trade, distance learning, hospices, urban farming and waste reduction to restorative justice and zero-carbon housing. But most of these are growing despite, not because of, help from governments.","The really interesting moment will be when you have a critical mass of people engaging through the networks, more than through the press and TV. When that happens, the culture of politics has to change, moving away from controlled one-way messages towards a political culture that is more questioning.","Most governments do have inbuilt biases in favour of the rich and powerful, and most do contain plenty of manipulators who love intrigue, who have lost whatever moral compass they may once have had and who protect themselves with steely cynicism.","Recycling is an area where jobs could be created at low cost. Green collar workers. That's not very sexy.","Understanding capitalism is in some ways simple. At its best, capitalism rewards creators, makers and providers: the people and firms that create valuable things for others, like imaginative technologies and good food, cars and drugs.","Governments that invest billions in new hardware still find it hard to accept that they might benefit just as much from systematic innovation in such things as child development or cutting crime.","Societies advance through innovation every bit as much as economies do.","With a fractured sense of self, we come to depend on what people feed back to us - often mediated through social networks - not what we are. We have complex identities but may become less able to act as a subject - confident in what we really are.","Lots of creativity is and should be solitary.","Many of the greatest composers and musicians do their best work in extreme confinement but we are seeing it in other fields - uses of technology to link people together in networks to solve problems and almost certainly we'll get better ideas than we would from them just doing it on their own.","The City of London has never been known for understanding technology and has never matched Silicon Valley's tradition of knowledgeable investment in technology start-ups, just as the U.K. government has never matched the vast investment made by the U.S. government.","As with products on supermarket shelves, the public has a right to know where their financial products and services come from.","Capitalism is not so much an aberration as a step on an evolutionary path, and one that contains within it some of the answers to its own contradictions.","All real capitalisms are impure hybrids, mongrels mixed with other strains.","The idea of entrepreneurship applies as much in politics, religion, society and the arts as it does in business.","The market turns out to be just one special case of collective decision-making.","Democratic nation states remain far more capable of managing the circuit of coercion, taxation and legitimation than any transnational bodies.","Europe has shown how government can be organised in a network. Its institutions both compete and co-operate and include a directly elected parliament that does not appoint the executive, independent judiciaries and a complex set of relationships between the Commission, the Council of Ministers and the Parliament.","It matters more how governments behave than how big they are.","I have a lot of admiration for people willing to face the public, but I'd prefer not to.","On the environment and climate change, I suspect that future generations will think there was too much timidity, too much fear of upsetting business. Basically, New Labour was very nervous about regulating business, or requiring it to do anything, even when there was a very clear social or environmental case for doing so.","Democracy isn't solely about polite conversations in parliaments. It needs to be continually refreshed with raw passions, anger and ideals.","A lot of people in government don't really read books at all.","I can think of nothing worse than a think-tank where everybody agreed.","I didn't much like being in Parliament physically. I found it a bit depressing. It's very dark and heavy. I like being out and about.","Over 5,000 years, states have made surprisingly consistent claims about their duties. They have promised to protect people from threats; promote their welfare; deliver justice and also, perhaps less obviously, uphold truth - originally truths about the cosmos, and more recently truths drawn from reason and knowledge.","States which used to communicate directly to their citizens now do so through the media, where their messages are reshaped by the logics of news values and commentary.","Vigorous independent and critical media are indispensable in a democracy.","Governments should want and even crave the best possible scientific advice. With reliable knowledge come better decisions, fewer mistakes and more results achieved for each pound spent.","As a civil servant in charge of the government's Strategy Unit, I brought in many people from outside government, including academia and science, to work in the unit, dissecting and solving complex problems from GM crops to alcohol, nuclear proliferation to schools reform.","Advisers who think that they are very clever while all around them are a bit thick, and that all the problems of the world would be solved if the thick listened to the clever, are liable to be disappointed.","In Britain, polls show large majorities in favour of mansion taxes and higher taxes on the finance sector.","Predation is part of the everyday life of capitalism, in sectors as mainstream as pharmaceuticals, software and oil - where people's money, their data, their time and their attention are routinely taken in fundamentally asymmetrical exchanges.","In every capitalist economy there are anti-capitalist movements, activists, and even political parties; in a way, that there are no longer anti-democratic movements, activists, and parties.","Economies are complex beasts that need people to do an extraordinary range of tasks.","There are hardly any apprenticeships in care; hardly any schools preparing teenagers for jobs in care; and few signs that politicians know what to do to raise the status and rewards for what will soon be one of our most important industries.","Immigration isn't always good for the economy or jobs.","Huge sums are invested globally in medical research and development - and with good reason.","The end of life is likely to be an important focus for innovation. Most people die in hospitals, tied up with tubes and with their bodies pumped full of drugs. Yet most would rather die at home and with more control over the timing and manner of their death.","Britain is rich in radicalism, and anyone who says that our society has drifted into fatalism and apathy should get out more.","Radicalism is as British as tea and cakes, as much a part of our make-up as monarchy and football. It will never have its own jubilees, palaces or honours system.","Health is already a dominant sector in most societies and the one most guaranteed to grow.","By international standards, many of the U.K.'s policies for civil society are exemplary. However, there are concerns about constraints on civil liberties - particularly restrictions on free assembly and about the rising tide of everyday regulation has seriously impeded community activity - from organising street parties to helping children.","Freecycle groups match people who have things they want to get rid of with people who can use them.","The most dynamic cities have always been immersed in the critical innovations of their time.","Bangalore has become a centre for healthcare.","Adelaide is becoming a hub for higher education.","Cities simply don't have the powers they need to radically innovate in cutting obesity or the number of disaffected teenagers.","Big business increasingly likes to portray itself as socially concerned, adopting the style of civic action through 'campaigns' of varying degrees of cynicism.","It's an irony that growing inequality could mean more money for philanthropy. In the U.S., quite a few of the ultra-rich have taken to heart the 19th century industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie's comment that it's a disgrace to die wealthy.","One effect of an individualistic culture that's poor at instilling mutual respect is that people jump more quickly to anger or violence.","Everyone knows of great projects that were too dependent on a charismatic individual, or simply too expensive to be replicated.","Spreading an idea is hard work.","The most important innovators often don't need any technologies - just imagination and acute sensitivity to people's needs.","The biggest barrier to dealing with climate change is us: our own attachment to habits that are hard to shift, and our great ability to park or ignore uncomfortable choices.","Before the Second World War, L'Oreal in France was an active supporter of the French fascists. The cosmetic group's founder Eugene Schueller was an active member of the 'Cagoule' group, committed to the violent overthrow of the Third Republic, and hosted meetings at Oreal headquarters.","Local government in England is simply too big. Our lowest tier serves an average population of 118,500, while in the U.S. and across continental Europe the figures are more like several thousand.","Many people leave government disillusioned about its ability to achieve change and cynical about politicians. I left with rather opposite lessons.","The wrongful arrest of tens of thousands of British Muslims after the September 11 attacks can be explained by the very poor intelligence the police had, and, just possibly, excused by the fact that a terrorist action in Britain linked to British Muslims would have been hugely damaging.","Societies can easily talk themselves into conflict and misery. But they can also talk, and act, their way out.","Courses can, and should, incorporate the excitement and fun of programming games, apps or even real digital devices.","Learning isn't something you should only do solo.","The smug complacency of technology adverts disguises a pretty mixed picture, with too many people not connected, too many passive users of technologies designed for interactive, and far too much talk about empowerment but far too little action to make it happen.","Even many of the teenagers who feel confident on navigating the web simply don't have the skills needed to 'write and create' digital tools, not simply consume them.","For most of human history, the main goal of states has been to conquer land and to achieve glory for their rulers, usually at others' expense. Then in recent decades it was all about GDP. It's only in very recent history that rulers have been willing to commit themselves to helping their citizens live happier lives.","Deeper fulfilment is rather different from the happiness of seeing a good film or watching your team win at football, and it doesn't come at the push of a button.","The once-science-fiction notion of hyper-connectivity - where we are all constantly connected to social networks and other bubbling streams of digital data - has rapidly become a widespread reality.","Young people who were relaxed about posting every detail of their life on Facebook become a lot less relaxed when they realise just how transparent their life has become to future employers."],"Geoff Ryman":["My favourite sites are all about web accessiblity, like Jakob Nielsen's site, but I'm afraid I've got quite utilitarian in my uses of the web. I buy things for friends and family in America on it. I find train times on it. I get a quick short article on a subject from it. I do not surf for fun much.","'253' has a little bit of time in it, but basically, everything's happening at once in a small space, and you're exploring the space. 'What happens next?' is not the question that you're asking or answering. It's where do you go, and why should you go there?","The trouble with writing for the web is that writing is about getting people to forget they're reading. Anything that reminds them they are reading, or which annoys or distracts them, bounces them out of the world. And the web, it seems to me, is all bounce. A very, very difficult medium to write for.","Franchising implies a financial arrangement, and I am always pleased to consider those.","I sure do think it is an emergent form, but I also despair of reading online until screen quality is better.","Traditional fiction has a little bit of spatial exploration but is basically a question of time - the question is, what happens next?","With the hyperlinks, '253' says, 'Look at all the links we have we don't know about.' Without the links, the message becomes, 'Look at God's infinite variety.'","I work with a lot of scientists, and one of the frustrating things they find is that all this fascinating stuff is being done which doesn't find its way into science fiction. They say look at the science fact pages - they're so much more imaginative than science fiction.","It's my experience that scientists can find it difficult to understand the needs of scriptwriters or storytellers."],"Geoff Stults":["In sports, every day you can be the hero or the goat.","The holiday season can be an especially trying time for our service men, women, and families. Military service and deployment create empty seats at holiday tables, religious services, and celebrations.","I did 'Good Morning America' with David Beckham. Oh, god, what a handsome devil that guy is.","There are athletes and celebrities that are out there and they Twitter and they constantly try to drum up press because they're narcissists.","I feel very blessed in my career to have been able to bounce back and forth between different things, television and film, comedies and some dramas, but I am, um, as long as the script inspires me and there good people, that's it. I'm in.","I think anybody can relate to the reluctance to have to lead sometimes.","You might be the leader of the team, but without the rest of the team, you're not doing anything. I think that's the way I look at my job as the lead of a TV show.","I've never thought that what I do as an actor does anything for anybody, other than making them laugh once in a while.","I don't look at things goin', 'Oh, is this gonna make me rich? Is this gonna make me a star? Am I gonna win awards?' If all that stuff happens, great. Who cares? I still have to wake up in the morning and go to work and be happy to do it.","You don't want to jump in on your first day on a show and start improv-ing and changing the show.","I think the one thing that athletics prepared me for that's been more beneficial than anything has been the humbling times.","I wanted to do a comedy. I'd been actively looking for a comedy. I wanted to do one that was different. Nothing against them, but I wasn't interested in just your normal sitcom, boy meets girl.","I've flown halfway around the world to kiss a girl. I jumped on a plane and flew to Australia.","I'm a laid-back guy. I like being outdoors. I enjoy hanging out.","You have to be engaged, or else you're not going to want to show up and go to work.","There's a million leading men on TV today that are perfectly great, and their jobs are fantastic. But it's not as interesting to me when every fight they win, every case they solve, every girl they get.","The older I've gotten, the more I try to stay out of the gym.","I do a lot of a cross training.","I always wanted to be an athlete. Then when I realized that I can't run very fast, jump very high, or catch anything, I thought, 'Maybe if this doesn't work out, I can be an actor.'","I wasn't a regular, avid 'Bones' fan, but I'd certainly seen it. I liked the banter; I liked the people and that world.","When you cast somebody, you write to their strengths.","A part of being in the army is you never really leave a man behind."],"Geoffrey Beene":["Designis a revelation to me. It's like taking something that is not alive and giving it form, shape, substance, and life.","Fashion is treated too much as news rather than what it is, what it does and how it performs.","A woman should be less concerned about Paris and more concerned about whether the dress she's about to buy relates to the way she lives.","Clothes should be as interesting on the inside as on the outside. Even if you enjoy it totally alone, it's important.","Clothes should look as if a woman was born into them. It is a form of possession, this belonging to one another.","Design is an unknown.","Fashion is in a terrible state. An overdose of too much flesh.","I come in. I'm going to sketch, I'm going to drape, I don't know what I'm going to do.","I tell women not to believe everything they read about fashion.","The greatest concubines in history knew that everything revealed with nothing concealed is a bore.","The influence of Paris, for instance, is now minimal. Yet a lot is written about Paris fashion.","When I don't have any ideas, I pick up fabric and start working with it and something happens."],"Geoffrey Boycott":["I agree that my single-minded approach was a failing in life, but if I upset people, it was never intentional - it was just the unfortunate result of a burning desire to get the best out of myself and achieve as much as possible.","I'd love to see pitches start very dry all over the world, which is good for batting but means there will be turn - a cricket match without spinners is like a chess match without two important pieces - a less interesting game.","I was not a political animal; I could not toady up to the committee men, pour drinks down their necks at the bar, and make them feel important. I was too focused on the cricket.","Once I got cancer of the tongue and throat, I realised that stress is a killer and I had to try and get stress out of my life.","Since I had cancer I've realised that every day is a bonus.","A lot of wasted energy in my life has been spent on sorting out problems and issues at Yorkshire cricket. Of course, I know I made mistakes along the way, but I care passionately about the club - I always have done and always will.","My mind became so frazzled by the end of the 1974 season that I decided the thing to do was give up playing for England and concentrate on Yorkshire. I felt the only way to succeed was to captain and play every match for Yorkshire.","If Trescothick had tried to get me off the field when batting well, I'd have hit him with my bat.","I think England will win a Test. My concern is Australia will probably win two.","When I was playing the game we never had the benefit of TV or video to analyse our techniques or look at faults, we depended on other cricketers to watch us and then tell us what they thought we were doing wrong.","Until you've had depression I don't think you're qualified to talk about it.","I played football for Leeds United under-18s, but at 17 my eyes started to go and I had to wear glasses. The football had to go - there were no contact lenses in 1957.","I've known people with exceptional talent - and some have wasted it. Ambition spurs a man on.","We've got to get the public back into watching Test matches - speeding up the game with innovation is one way forward.","The contribution of Anthony William Greig to English cricket has been underestimated because of his allegiance to Kerry Packer and his choice to recruit players for World Series Cricket while still the England captain. His critics hold that as a black mark against him, which rules out anything else he may have done.","Unlike cricket, where I reached the top solely down to my own efforts, cancer was not a one-man battle. This time, I couldn't have done it on my own. Without the support and bullying encouragement of my wife Rachael, I would not be here now.","Emma wasn't bothered about the fact that I was a 'celebrity', held in high esteem by millions of cricket fans around the world. As far as she was concerned, I was just her dad, and she believed that role should take priority over anything else.","Throughout Yorkshire's history, the committee had not been known for its visionary approach. They just assumed that because Yorkshire had been fantastic in the past, and the county was full of kids wanting to play cricket, everything would be okay.","During the time I didn't play for England, they were losing Test matches, and the Yorkshire committee were telling me that I should be batting for my country. Then, when I decided to make myself available to play for England again in 1977, and Yorkshire lost a couple of matches in my absence, they criticised me for not being there.","I always loved the Yorkshire members and was passionate about playing for the county, but the people who were running the club made it at times unbearable for me. The rulers had a history of doing what they wanted and sacking players seemingly on a whim.","'Boycott caused all the trouble,' they say, as if I could have canvassed all those people personally to take a stand in 1983. Nonsense! The committee were the ones with the power to make the decisions, not me. They started the unrest, they did the sackings, and they reaped what they sowed.","Good scores are valuable, but centuries stick in the mind. There are influential people who might not notice a good innings of 60 or 70, but they will react if you get a hundred.","The difference between a score in the 90s and a century is often reflected as the difference between failure and success. It may be illogical, but in cricket, a century has its own magic.","I usually tried to stay in the net for 45 minutes, half an hour longer than most batsmen would stick at the county nets. There was a reason for this so-called gluttony of practice: it was a conscious effort to make myself concentrate for long periods of time in circumstances as close to the real thing as I could make them.","I don't think anybody can totally change what they are. I'd always been a strident individual, but cancer does smooth off a lot of the edges. I have been lucky to have survived an extra 12 years of my life with my wife and daughter."],"Geoffrey Canada":["People don't believe or understand that a community can lose hope. You can have a whole community where hopelessness is the norm, where folks don't have faith that things will get better because history and circumstances have proven over 30, 40, or 50 years that things don't get better.","Video games offer violent messages, and even the sports video games include taunting and teasing.","You grow up in America and you're told from day one, 'This is the land of opportunity.' That everybody has an equal chance to make it in this country. And then you look at places like Harlem, and you say, 'That is absolutely a lie.'","The tendency in lots of large organizations is to try and find a comfortable place where you think you can get measured rewards for measured work.","Poverty places not just one or two obstacles but multiple obstacles in a child's pathway to what we would consider to be regular development - cognitively, intellectually and emotionally.","Many schools today are sacrificing social studies, the arts and physical education so children can cover basic subjects like math, English and science.","Education is the only billion dollar industry that tolerates abject failure.","When I first found out that Superman wasn't real, I was about maybe eight. And I was talking to my mother about it. And she was like, 'No, no, no. There's no Superman.' And I started crying. I really thought he was coming to rescue us. The chaos, the violence, the danger. No hero was coming.","Kids who are poor often have families that have not really been kept informed about... how important it is to read to your child, to reduce stresses in their life, to use positive incentives and words.","My own faith was nurtured by my grandmother and her clinging deeply to her faith when she was dying a painful and slow death from cancer.","Middle-class families know education begins at birth.","The rates of soda consumption in our poorest communities cannot be explained by individual consumer preferences alone, but rather are linked to broader issues of access and affordability of healthy foods in low-income neighborhoods, and to the marketing efforts of soda companies themselves.","I graduated from Bowdoin College and went to the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Then I left and took a job teaching really poor inner-city white kids in Boston. It was interesting to me because I'd never been around poor whites before.","Lots of boys pick strong messages about who they are and who they want to be from the media.","An extended school day gives administrators the ability to ensure children get a well-rounded education.","How is it we could have a system where schools could remain lousy for 50 years and yet you do exactly the same thing this year that they did 50 years ago when it didn't work then, and no one feels any pressure to change?","I believe that for lots of churches and religious institutions, their main focus on the development of faith among parishioners needs to spread to the community.","At a school in Massachusetts where I once worked, we managed early on through consensus. Which sounds wonderful, but it was just a very, very difficult way to sort of manage anything, because convincing everybody to do one particular thing, especially if it was hard, was almost impossible.","Convincing people to give your way a try will work if you neutralize - and sometimes you have to cauterize - the ones who really are against change. They're the kind of person who, if you tell them it's raining outside, they'll fight you tooth and nail.","There's not a day that goes by that I don't draw on my undergraduate background in psychology.","My contract with my teachers is fair, and is two pages. The union contract is 200 pages. You cannot manage your business when you cannot make any decision without going back to 200 pages worth of stuff.","If you are a lousy teacher, you should be fired.","Teachers need to be paid like professionals.","We've gotta guarantee all of our kids an education.","I want my kids to graduate from high school. But that's not enough. I also want them to go to college. Why? Because rich people's kids go to college. And if that's good enough for them, it's good enough for my kids. Because you know what? College graduates don't tend to go to jail as frequently as nongraduates.","You go through the Civil Rights struggle, everybody knew the songs - 'We shall overcome.' Everybody would sing it. Music helped us. James Brown, 'Say It Loud - I'm Black and I'm Proud.' They helped black people figure out how to navigate what was a very treacherous place in America for them.","Young people will tell you, if you're not prepared to write the most violent, the most misogynistic, the most horrible kinds of rhymes and scenarios, you are not going to get air play.","Good dental care doesn't make you a good student, but if your tooth hurts, it's hard to be a good student.","People talk about Wall Street greed, but one of the things many people don't understand is that there are a lot of organizations that have been the recipient of largess from the same Wall Street.","It is important to have permanent safe spaces in Harlem.","When I was growing up, kids used to talk about snitching... It never extended as a cultural norm outside of the gangsters.","One of the things that sells music is when the artist is looked at as someone who's come up from the streets. Not just any streets, but the toughest, meanest streets of the urban ghetto. And that's called 'street credibility.'","Movies portray men as tough guys.","Boys want to grow up to be like their male role models. And boys who grow up in homes with absent fathers search the hardest to figure out what it means to be male.","It's just becoming more acceptable for girls to react violently.","You don't need someone destroying you when your own people are the worst messengers possible. And this is what black people in America have not come to grips with.","The system decides you can't run schools in the summer.","When I began working in not-for-profits, it was taking a vow of poverty, which eliminated huge numbers of folks.","In two-parent households, women have increasingly entered the workplace, and in single-parent households, there is even more of a need for the adults to work. That means parents do not fully control their own schedule and have to scramble to find high-quality after-school options."],"Geoffrey Chaucer":["And she was fair as is the rose in May.","Time and tide wait for no man.","Women desire six things: They want their husbands to be brave, wise, rich, generous, obedient to wife, and lively in bed.","The life so short, the crafts so long to learn.","People can die of mere imagination.","Love is blind.","Filth and old age, I'm sure you will agree, are powerful wardens upon chastity.","There's never a new fashion but it's old.","Whoso will pray, he must fast and be clean, And fat his soul, and make his body lean.","The greatest scholars are not usually the wisest people.","By nature, men love newfangledness.","Forbid us something, and that thing we desire.","There's no workman, whatsoever he be, That may both work well and hastily.","We know little of the things for which we pray.","He was as fresh as is the month of May.","Murder will out, this my conclusion.","Nowhere so busy a man as he than he, and yet he seemed busier than he was.","First he wrought, and afterward he taught.","The guilty think all talk is of themselves."],"Geoffrey Fisher":["Until you know that life is interesting - and find it so - you haven't found your soul.","The long and distressing controversy over capital punishment is very unfair to anyone meditating murder.","In cities no one is quiet but many are lonely; in the country, people are quiet but few are lonely.","This country and the Commonwealth last Tuesday were not far from the Kingdom of Heaven.","I hope that by going to visit the pope I have enabled everybody to see that the words Catholic and Protestant, as ordinarily used, are completely out of date. They are almost always used now purely for propaganda purposes. That is why so much trouble is caused by them.","My feelings are those of a schoolboy getting in sight of the holidays. Or more seriously, my feelings are perhaps those of a matador who has decided not to enter the bull ring.","Once you start, there is no end to who is to go in and who is to be left out.","I have asked myself once or twice lately what was my natural bent. I have no doubt at all: It is to look at each day for the evil of that day and have a go at it, and that is why I have never failed to have an acute interest in each morning's letters.","Who knows whether in retirement I shall be tempted to the last infirmity of mundane minds, which is to write a book.","Some of the press who speak loudly about the freedom of the press are themselves the enemies of freedom. Countless people dare not say a thing because they know it will be picked up and made a song of by the press. That limits freedom.","In a civilized society, all crimes are likely to be sins, but most sins are not and ought not to be treated as crimes. Man's ultimate responsibility is to God alone."],"Geoffrey Hinton":["The brain sure as hell doesn't work by somebody programming in rules.","Machines can do things cheaper and better. We're very used to that in banking, for example. ATM machines are better than tellers if you want a simple transaction. They're faster, they're less trouble, they're more reliable, so they put tellers out of work.","I am scared that if you make the technology work better, you help the NSA misuse it more. I'd be more worried about that than about autonomous killer robots.","In a sensibly organised society, if you improve productivity, there is room for everybody to benefit.","We want to take AI and CIFAR to wonderful new places, where no person, no student, no program has gone before.","I have always been convinced that the only way to get artificial intelligence to work is to do the computation in a way similar to the human brain. That is the goal I have been pursuing. We are making progress, though we still have lots to learn about how the brain actually works.","A deep-learning system doesn't have any explanatory power.","The role of radiologists will evolve from doing perceptual things that could probably be done by a highly trained pigeon to doing far more cognitive things.","Deep learning is already working in Google search and in image search; it allows you to image-search a term like 'hug.' It's used to getting you Smart Replies to your Gmail. It's in speech and vision. It will soon be used in machine translation, I believe.","Computers will understand sarcasm before Americans do.","In the brain, you have connections between the neurons called synapses, and they can change. All your knowledge is stored in those synapses.","My father was an entomologist who believed in continental drift. In the early '50s, that was regarded as nonsense. It was in the mid-'50s that it came back. Someone had thought of it 30 or 40 years earlier named Alfred Wegener, and he never got to see it come back.","The paradigm for intelligence was logical reasoning, and the idea of what an internal representation would look like was it would be some kind of symbolic structure. That has completely changed with these big neural nets.","I feel slightly embarrassed by being called 'the godfather.'","Take any old classification problem where you have a lot of data, and it's going to be solved by deep learning. There's going to be thousands of applications of deep learning.","Most people at CMU thought it was perfectly reasonable for the U.S. to invade Nicaragua. They somehow thought they owned it.","In A.I., the holy grail was how do you generate internal representations.","I get very excited when we discover a way of making neural networks better - and when that's closely related to how the brain works.","The brain has about ten thousand parameters for every second of experience. We do not really have much experience about how systems like that work or how to make them be so good at finding structure in data.","Most people in AI, particularly the younger ones, now believe that if you want a system that has a lot of knowledge in, like an amount of knowledge that would take millions of bits to quantify, the only way to get a good system with all that knowledge in it is to make it learn it. You are not going to be able to put it in by hand.","We now think of internal representation as great big vectors, and we do not think of logic as the paradigm for how to get things to work. We just think you can have these great big neural nets that learn, and so, instead of programming, you are just going to get them to learn everything.","In science, you can say things that seem crazy, but in the long run, they can turn out to be right. We can get really good evidence, and in the end, the community will come around.","I have a Reagan-like ability to believe in my own data.","Now that neural nets work, industry and government have started calling neural nets AI. And the people in AI who spent all their life mocking neural nets and saying they'd never do anything are now happy to call them AI and try and get some of the money.","I had a stormy graduate career, where every week we would have a shouting match. I kept doing deals where I would say, 'Okay, let me do neural nets for another six months, and I will prove to you they work.' At the end of the six months, I would say, 'Yeah, but I am almost there. Give me another six months.'","I am betting on Google's team to be the epicenter of future breakthroughs.","I think the way we're doing computer vision is just wrong.","My view is we should be doing everything we can to come up with ways of exploiting the current technology effectively.","The question is, can we make neural networks that are 1,000 times bigger? And how can we do that with existing computation?","Everybody right now, they look at the current technology, and they think, 'OK, that's what artificial neural nets are.' And they don't realize how arbitrary it is. We just made it up! And there's no reason why we shouldn't make up something else.","My main interest is in trying to find radically different kinds of neural nets.","Irony is going to be hard to get. You have to be master of the literal first. But then, Americans don't get irony either. Computers are going to reach the level of Americans before Brits.","The NSA is already bugging everything that everybody does. Each time there's a new revelation from Snowden, you realise the extent of it.","All you need is lots and lots of data and lots of information about what the right answer is, and you'll be able to train a big neural net to do what you want.","In the long run, curiosity-driven research just works better... Real breakthroughs come from people focusing on what they're excited about.","Any new technology, if it's used by evil people, bad things can happen. But that's more a question of the politics of the technology.","Once your computer is pretending to be a neural net, you get it to be able to do a particular task by just showing it a whole lot of examples.","I think it's very clear now that we will have self-driving cars.","Early AI was mainly based on logic. You're trying to make computers that reason like people. The second route is from biology: You're trying to make computers that can perceive and act and adapt like animals.","Humans are still much better than computers at recognizing speech.","Making everything more efficient should make everybody happier.","I got fed up with academia and decided I would rather be a carpenter.","The pooling operation used in convolutional neural networks is a big mistake, and the fact that it works so well is a disaster."],"Geoffrey Holder":["Education begins at home. You can't blame the school for not putting into your child what you don't put into him.","We are too quick to put labels on things. It is my profession. I get up and paint. Everyone wants to put a label on it, but I am a free spirit, so I fight against that.","I paint a slice of life, whatever it is that day."],"Geoffrey Rush":["I always had a fantasy of being a chef, because I like kitchen life.","Within our culture, every school has a swimming pool. We lived on the coast. People swam in the surf. It's a very sporty nation and at that particular time anyone who had an artistic bent was very much an outsider. So if you liked reading or ideas or playing the piano then your dad viewed you as a sissy, basically.","Nobody ever said that growing old would be easy. Just having to hold the newspaper out in your forties and then hair growing out of unusual parts of your body in your fifties. It's tough on the ego.","I did not want to put myself on the line, as an Australian playing Britain's greatest comic actor. The fans of Sellers are obsessive, possessive - and aggressive. I did not want to risk their anger - or my own reputation.","My eye muscles hurt now when I read our MasterCard bill.","Yeah, well, the F-bomb - it's become as ubiquitous as the word 'like.' People just throw the word 'like' around as punctuation. And I think in a lot of everyday speech, the F-bomb has become a kind of dash or a comma.","What I appreciated was the fact that the script delved into how Australians were - and still are - condescended to by the English.","They were saying, 'Keep this under your hat, but Jack Sparrow's going to die in the second movie.' I went, 'You're kidding me. The fans are going to go berserk.'","I asked, 'What is this guy?' They said, he's part-fish, part-bird, maybe a bit of lizard, and you don't have to go through five hours of makeup to play him. That was good enough for me.","I often thought I was in the wrong business. I was pretty seriously thinking of tossing it in before I shot Shine. I do not know why. I was pretty restless, I had been through a bad period of stress induced anxiety - panic attacks - and I was not sure of what I wanted to do.","When people come to me and tell me I was terrific in this or that, I do not want to fall flat on my face the next time. But, tough, I have fallen flat before. You just get up and dust yourself off.","It's their story, and I got to be the guy in the back while they were in the foreground.","This is what happens when you are on the wrong side of 40. Young adults, who could be your children, are now working with you. I was playing their parents or mentor. I started to think: Oh, I am not part of that group any more.","People are intrigued and fascinated, almost obsessed with the private lives of great public personalities.","Yes, anally retentive men are my forte!","People tend to think of Brisbane as a sleepy, sub-topical place. I don't know. It's like Baltimore or something. I don't know. You would hear the family dramas going on behind closed doors.","I knew all about Edward VIII's abdication, George VI becoming the king and having a stammer, but nothing about how he got rid of it.","Most films I've worked on have had large casts, but they've been wonderful people. I think the monkey in Pirates of the Caribbean is the most temperamental costar I've had. It would throw tantrums like you wouldn't believe.","I was never a leading man. I've always been in the outer concentric circles in the company, being a character actor, which is a good place to be. It gives you that diversity.","I die in almost every film I've been in.","There's four biggies. There was Elizabeth I, George III, Victoria, and the current queen, who really dominated four eras.","But as my voice coach keeps saying, if we actually spoke the way they imagine the Elizabethan voice might have been, we wouldn't be able to understand it.","You had to be into sport and, sad to say, I'm a traitor to my country because I don't have a sporting bone in my body.","I always felt thrilled and amazed that I could put actor on my tax form.","I guess I've been fortunate in having an ongoing film career while being based in Melbourne. I'm happy to commute. A day on a plane. Come on. It's easy.","I didn't know the Green Lantern comics at all. I was a Superman reader.","Someone told me that there's a connection to Superman, that in an early edition of the Green Lantern comics, Tomar Re was the envoy to Krypton. That was fascinating to me.","I like roles that are on the extreme ends of the spectrum, and there's special appeal in exploring these slightly forgotten plays that people might think of as subjects for academic term papers instead of live theater.","I think that Ionesco's greatest weapon is that he's able to make us laugh at the darkest corners of our souls.","I do love perusing the dictionary to find how many words I don't use - words that have specific, sharp, focused meaning. I also love the sound of certain words. I love the sound of the word pom-pom.","Sometimes you do feel a script that glows in your hand the moment you start reading it. By page four of Shakespeare in Love, I said, 'I have to be in this movie.'","My kids started school, so having a strong base in Melbourne has been a key priority. I'm not daunted by the travel. People say, 'It's so far to Australia,' and I say, 'You get on the plane, you eat well, you sleep, you wake up - and you're there.'","I wouldn't mind meeting some of the people I've attempted to portray from the olden, olden days. They probably would all have really terrible skin and horrible bad breath, and I'd have to give them an Altoid."],"Geoffrey S. Fletcher":["I'm interested in how innocence fares when it collides with hard reality.","From stoplights to skyscrapers, turn anywhere in civilization and you will see imagination at work. It's in our inventions, advances and remedies and how a single parent masterminds each day. Imagination is boundless, surrounds us and resides in us all.","Characters who experience great trauma will sometimes create an escape.","It's so easy today to get swept up in celebrity fixation and materialism and searching for some validation outside of yourself when we know it's really found within and through meaningful connections with other people.","I don't have to go into outer space to write about an astronaut.","I was always writing scripts, and I had made several shorts, before and after film school. But I worked a variety of temp positions over the years.","My brothers were the ones who taught me about mythology and storytelling, and showed me how to do stop-motion animation.","I think if you get your fifth script made, that's the fast track. But there's no guarantee any of them will get made.","I think there are many more stories still to be told about women.","The brutality that can take place in a crime film heightens the tenderness that can also be there.","I often think about the many remarkable things that my personal computer can do which I never ask it to do. I probably use a small fraction of its capabilities. I often wonder if the same dynamic occurs with our capacity for creativity.","In these times of stress, snark, division and despair, I still suspect that two of the most important features we possess are imagination and a capacity for goodness. Those are qualities for which we will be remembered most fondly.","If humanity is being swallowed by a modern primitivism, imagination might be the thing that saves us all.","There is so much talent out there and not quite as much opportunity.","There are few films where you have women really driving the plot.","Women have a greater verbal capacity.","You only get one world premiere of your directorial debut.","I love so many different genres. I love crime films - and unusual coming-of-age pieces.","It's always healthy to be taken down a notch, even though it's humbling.","I don't think there's enough breadth to the stories told about African-Americans.","It may take hundreds of pages before you begin to get a handle on the craft of writing, and your first scripts may not work. The next five to twenty may not either. However, the ones that do work owe everything to the ones that didn't.","'Precious' is strangely uplifting. It goes down into the valley but it also goes to the mountain tops. A lot of difficult realities are explored in 'Precious,' but the peaks make the valleys and the valleys make the peaks.","My M.F.A was in directing, and all the films I've made, for film school and after, I've written, directed and shot.","If you do the math, films featuring women are a good investment.","You can be moved by an animated film and not by a live action film. There could be great inspiration in and humanity in that animated story.","I devoted myself to writing for years without representation or a promise of anything. And there were times when I felt quite down about my prospects.","My mother enjoyed few things more than investing in the underdogs and showing them that they were special and could achieve their dreams."],"Geoffrey Ward":["Bill Murray is a wonderful actor, and he's very funny, and I've seen him be serious and terrific.","I have always had a great interest in visually documenting the past.","Most filmmakers aren't very interested in history. They worry constantly that people will be bored.","Books provide context and allow you to think about things over time. Film is like writing haiku; there is an immense amount of pleasure in paring down and paring down. But it isn't the same.","The real Jack Johnson was both more and less than those who loved or those who hated him ever knew. He embodied American individualism in its purest form; nothing - no law or custom, no person white or black, male or female - could keep him for long from whatever he wanted."],"Geoffrey West":["When you look at a city, you know, it looks so unique. You feel this kind of uniqueness, you know, and especially if you go from a big city to a small city or if you go from one country to another. Cities look very different, often. They even feel very different. You know, and they are, of course. They certainly are.","The paradigm of physics - with its interplay of data, theory and prediction - is the most powerful in science.","Cities are obvious metaphors for life. We call roads 'arteries' and so forth.","Cities are the origins of global warming, impact on the environment, health, pollution, disease, finance, economies, energy are all problems that are confronted by having cities. That's where they - all these problems come from.","We form cities in order to enhance interaction, to facilitate growth, wealth creation, ideas, innovation, but in so doing, we create, from a physicist's viewpoint, entropy.","Once we started to urbanize, we put ourselves on this treadmill. We traded away stability for growth. And growth requires change.","Tell me the size of a mammal and I can tell you, to about 85 per cent level, pretty much everything about its physiology and life history, such as how long it is going to live, how many offspring it will have, the length of its aorta, how long it will take to mature, what is the pulse rate in the ninth branch of its circuitry.","Every fundamental law has exceptions. But you still need the law or else all you have is observations that don't make sense. And that's not science. That's just taking notes.","It's hard to kill a city, but easy to kill a company.","Cities are just a physical manifestation of your interactions, our interactions, and the clustering and grouping of individuals.","Slums could be thought of as the development of a special organ, or they could be thought of as a tumor that's grown, and in some ways is unhealthy and could ultimately lead to the city's destruction. My own feeling is that slums are probably a bit of both.","Your cells are not working as hard as your dog's but harder than your horse's. The bigger the animal, the less energy needed to sustain a gram of tissue.","I've always wanted to find the rules that govern everything. It's amazing that such rules exist. It's even more amazing that we can find them.","Sometimes, I look out at nature and I think, 'Everything here is obeying my conjecture.' It's a wonderfully narcissistic feeling.","If you ask people why they move to the city, they always give the same reasons. They've come to get a job or follow their friends or to be at the center of a scene. That's why we pay the high rent. Cities are all about the people, not the infrastructure.","Everything around us is scale dependent. It's woven into the fabric of the universe.","Cities are the crucible of civilization.","Exciting cities stay exciting, and boring cities stay boring.","Cities tolerate crazy people. Companies don't.","A human being at rest runs on 90 watts. That's how much power you need just to lie down. And if you're a hunter-gatherer and you live in the Amazon, you'll need about 250 watts. That's how much energy it takes to run about and find food.","When I first saw California, it was extraordinary. Because I came from old, black, dark England, still recovering from World War II. I grew up with bomb sites everywhere.","The bigger the city is, the less infrastructure you need per capita.","On average, an individual doesn't have a powerful connection with more than four to six people, and that's just as true here in the U.S. as it is in China.","I spent most of my career doing high-energy physics, quarks, dark matter, string theory and so on.","My provocative statement is that we desperately need a serious, scientific theory of cities and scientific theory means quantifiable, relying on underlying generic principles that can be made in a - put into a predictive framework. That's the quest.","You could not have evolved a complex system like a city or an organism - with an enormous number of components - without the emergence of laws that constrain their behavior in order for them to be resilient.","Life is extraordinarily resilient. It's been around for over a billion years.","One of the remarkable things about slums is that they do develop their own social organization and economy and even culture that is, on some level, functional and in some cases, remarkably resilient. This is kind of amazing.","A city plays the role of a great big magnet that's sucking people up."],"Geoffrey Zakarian":["I love hospitality, and I love cooking. The kitchen is where I feel most at ease and where I feel most like myself.","I love hotel rooms, so I take pictures of the room and the way out and the lobby, the food and drink.","When I step into the kitchen in the morning, I go for the scrambled eggs with pine nuts and minced lamb. When I finish at night, it is hard to resist the burger.","It's important to salt the tomatoes before draining them because that helps pull out the water. Fresh herbs, some garlic and pepper will also enhance the flavor.","When you have a chef that wants to be in the spotlight, maybe after one or two appearances on a show, they think they're at a certain level that they haven't reached yet in the kitchen. Shows like 'Top Chef', 'Hell's Kitchen' have helped bring attention to the culinary world.","I always request a king-size bed, and if I can't, I try to work that out right after I land. I unpack immediately so the clothes don't get wrinkled. I go the gym. I adjust the temperature; I like the room kind of warm. And then turn on CNBC.","Comfort food is really anything you want at that time. That said, I really love Naple-style pizza.","I've been working in boutique hotels my whole life.","Everybody these days wants to be a star, including myself. Don't get me wrong, I'm a chef but you want to market yourself and your projects.","Chestnuts are my favorite ingredient to use in the fall, especially for the holidays. I always find that they are meaty, hearty and have a mysterious refinement when cooked or roasted over sea salt.","The Lamb's Club is going to be a luxury bar and grill; we're not doing an overly fancy restaurant. We wanted to make a space that people will come to every day, almost like a very high-end bistro.","I'm the culinary and creative consultant for The Water Club.","Shows like 'Top Chef,' 'Hell's Kitchen' have helped bring attention to the culinary world on a whole, but you have to be cautious it doesn't get out of hand.","I've never missed a flight. And I don't see any reason in cutting it close because airports are pleasurable for me: You can go to the restaurant, get a massage, browse books, sit at a bar, check emails.","If we have meetings, I try to schedule the meetings at different restaurants I want to try - so I always suggest the restaurants.","Days off are few and far between in the restaurant business. But on an hour off, I like to have a glass of wine with my wife.","Everyone could use instructions on every aspect of cooking: pantry, storage, refrigeration, cooking, what to buy. Everyone that I come into contact with could use help.","Cooking a piece of fish and cooking it right. Knowing the fish, knowing the properties of the fish. That's a hard thing to do rather than covering it with a lot of sauces and foams or other cooking methods that might be high wire acts and look good on the outside.","How you treat the quiet, shy types is the most important. If you leave them to sit in a corner, they will be noticed, and it will affect everyone's time. I instantly spring on them and treat them as royalty, showing them around and introducing them to everyone so they seem special.","I use the confit principle for chicken thighs. I season them with herbs and garlic, let them marinate, and then cook them in chicken fat.","Confit is not something that comes to mind for summer. Usually it means duck confit, made by cooking the legs and thighs in duck fat to preserve them for winter.","There's a point of no return when you're cooking tomatoes. A little too much heat, a little too long in the pot, and you lose that sense of fresh ripeness that makes tomatoes so great.","If you cook chopped tomatoes with all of their juices, it takes a long time for the sauce to reach the right consistency. By then, the freshness is gone.","A plate of food has to have balance. For example, a mild fish like skate mustn't be overwhelmed by the side dishes. They should have personality and color, but they also have to be subtle.","I still have the 'New York Post' delivered because it's so garrulous and nasty and wonderful when you read it in print. Some things just don't translate online.","I don't usually have time for TV. When I get home at night, I just want to fall asleep.","I begin my day online and end my day online. I like to prepare myself for the next day and have a sense of closure before I go to bed.","Determine who you are and what your brand is, and what you're not. The rest of it is just a lot of noise.","I'm a freak of neat. The kitchen has to be clean.","When I entertain, I want to have fun. But I'm also a control person. I don't go in for those everyone-in-the-kitchen cooking scenes. So if I want to be with my guests, I have to do everything - or nearly everything - in advance.","I do not believe in eating fish hot. People always insist on hot fish, but that leaves it dried out.","Undercook swordfish, and you get rubber. Overcook it, and you lose the fat and succulence.","I like tuna when there's a definite streak of deep pink in the middle, medium rare so to speak, and it comes out best when it's not cut too thick."],"Georg Baselitz":["I don't like things that can be reproduced. Wood isn't important in itself but rather in the fact that objects made in it are unique, simple, unpretentious.","I always work out of uncertainty but when a painting's finished it becomes a fixed idea, apparently a final statement. In time though, uncertainty returns... your thought process goes on.","I had always loved expressionist painting, like every European. In fact I admired it all the more because these were precisely the paintings despised by my father's generation.","I always feel attacked when I'm asked about my painting.","I paint German artists whom I admire. I paint their pictures, their work as painters, and their portraits too. But oddly enough, each of these portraits ends up as a picture of a woman with blonde hair. I myself have never been able to work out why this happens.","The artist is not responsible to any one. His social role is asocial... his only responsibility consists in an attitude to the work he does.","Unlike the expressionists, I have never been interested in renewing the world through the vehicle of art."],"Georg Brandes":["Among the delights of Summer were picnics to the woods.","Being gifted needs courage.","A love for humanity came over me, and watered and fertilised the fields of my inner world which had been lying fallow, and this love of humanity vented itself in a vast compassion.","Any feeling that I was enriching my mind from those surrounding me was unfortunately rare with me.","He who does not understand a joke, he does not understand Danish.","When I was a little boy I did not, of course, trouble much about my appearance.","Birth was something that came quite unexpectedly, and afterwards there was one child more in the house.","But I did not find any positive inspiration in my studies until I approached my nineteenth year.","But my doubt would not be overcome. Kierkegaard had declared that it was only to the consciousness of sin that Christianity was not horror or madness. For me it was sometimes both.","But when I was twelve years old I caught my first strong glimpse of one of the fundamental forces of existence, whose votary I was destined to be for life - namely, Beauty.","I admired in others the strength that I lacked myself.","I became an ardent, but never a specially good, dancer.","I came into the world two months too soon, I was in such a hurry.","I did not know what it was to be happy for a whole day at a time, scarcely for an hour.","I encountered among my comrades the most varied human traits, from frankness to reserve, from goodness, uprightness and kindness, to brutality and baseness.","I was a town child, it is true, but that did not prevent me enjoying open-air life, with plants and animals.","I was always hearing that I was pale and thin and small.","I was at home then in the world of figures, but not in that of values.","I was not afraid of what I did not like. To overcome dislike of a thing often satisfied one's feeling of honour.","I was not given to looking at life in a rosy light.","It gradually dawned upon me that there was no one more difficult to please than my mother.","It was jolly in the country. A cow and little pigs to play with and milk warm from the cow.","Just about this time, when in imagination I was so great a warrior, I had good use in real life for more strength, as I was no longer taken to school by the nurse, but instead had myself to protect my brother, two years my junior.","My father, though, could run very much faster. It was impossible to compete with him on the grass. But it was astonishing how slow old people were. Some of them could not run up a hill and called it trying to climb stairs.","My first experiences of academic friendship made me smile in after years when I looked back on them. But my circle of acquaintances had gradually grown so large that it was only natural new friendships should grow out of it.","On the whole, the world was friendly. It chiefly depended on whether one were good or not.","Poor is the power of the lead that becomes bullets compared to the power of the hot metal that becomes types.","School is a foretaste of life.","Six hours a day I lived under school discipline in active intercourse with people none of whom were known to those at home, and the other hours of the twenty-four I spent at home, or with relatives of the people at home, none of whom were known to anybody at school.","That a literature in our time is living is shown in that way that it debates problems.","The Danish glee: the national version of cheerfulness.","The person upon whom the schoolboys' attention centred was, of course, the Headmaster.","The stream of time sweeps away errors, and leaves the truth for the inheritance of humanity.","The war imbued my tin soldiers with quite a new interest. It was impossible to have boxes enough of them."],"Georg Buchner":["We are only puppets, our strings are being pulled by unknown forces.","Revolution is like Saturn, it devours its own children.","A good man with a good conscience doesn't walk so fast.","Dying people often become childish.","The life of the wealthy is one long Sunday.","The statue of Freedom has not been cast yet, the furnace is hot, we can all still burn our fingers.","You women could make someone fall in love even with a lie.","The stars are scattered all over the sky like shimmering tears, there must be great pain in the eye from which they trickled.","Whoever finishes a revolution only halfway, digs his own grave.","The strides of humanity are slow, they can only be counted in centuries.","That is a long word: forever!","Death is the most blessed dream.","We are always on stage, even when we are stabbed in earnest at the end.","There are only Epicureans, either crude or refined; Christ was the most refined.","One must love humanity in order to reach out into the unique essence of each individual: no one can be too low or too ugly.","They say in the grave there is peace, and peace and the grave are one and the same.","How many women does one need to sing the scale of love all the way up and down?","Love is a peculiar thing.","Your words smell of corpses.","Peace to the shacks! War on the palaces!","We have not made the Revolution, the Revolution has made us.","Government must be a transparent garment which tightly clings to the people's body.","The world is chaos. Nothingness is the yet-to-be-born god of the world.","I'll know how to die with courage; that is easier than living.","The revolutionary government is the despotism of liberty against tyranny.","The weapon of the Republic is terror, and virtue is its strength.","The death clock is ticking slowly in our breast, and each drop of blood measures its time, and our life is a lingering fever.","Raise your eyes and count the small gang of your oppressors who are only strong through the blood they suck from you and through your arms which you lend them unwillingly.","The breath of an aristocrat is the death rattle of freedom.","The power of the people and the power of reason are one."],"Georg C. Lichtenberg":["Sickness is mankind's greatest defect.","Man loves company - even if it is only that of a small burning candle.","Much can be inferred about a man from his mistress: in her one beholds his weaknesses and his dreams.","If you are going to build something in the air it is always better to build castles than houses of cards.","Just as the performance of the vilest and most wicked deeds requires spirit and talent, so even the greatest demand a certain insensitivity which under other circumstances we would call stupidity.","Man is a masterpiece of creation if for no other reason than that, all the weight of evidence for determinism notwithstanding, he believes he has free will.","Every man has his moral backside which he refrains from showing unless he has to and keeps covered as long as possible with the trousers of decorum.","A handful of soldiers is always better than a mouthful of arguments.","Nothing is more conducive to peace of mind than not having any opinion at all.","Once we know our weaknesses they cease to do us any harm.","Here take back the stuff that I am, nature, knead it back into the dough of being, make of me a bush, a cloud, whatever you will, even a man, only no longer make me me.","We have no words for speaking of wisdom to the stupid. He who understands the wise is wise already.","The fly that doesn't want to be swatted is most secure when it lights on the fly-swatter.","Even truth needs to be clad in new garments if it is to appeal to a new age.","He who says he hates every kind of flattery, and says it in earnest, certainly does not yet know every kind of flattery.","The most dangerous untruths are truths slightly distorted.","Be wary of passing the judgment: obscure. To find something obscure poses no difficult, elephants and poodles find many things obscure.","Doubt must be no more than vigilance, otherwise it can become dangerous.","The Greeks possessed a knowledge of human nature we seem hardly able to attain to without passing through the strengthening hibernation of a new barbarism.","Many things about our bodies would not seem to us so filthy and obscene if we did not have the idea of nobility in our heads.","I cannot say whether things will get better if we change; what I can say is they must change if they are to get better.","Everyone is a genius at least once a year. The real geniuses simply have their bright ideas closer together.","Just as we outgrow a pair of trousers, we outgrow acquaintances, libraries, principles, etc., at times before they're worn out and times - and this is the worst of all - before we have new ones.","Perhaps in time the so-called Dark Ages will be thought of as including our own.","Never undertake anything for which you wouldn't have the courage to ask the blessings of heaven.","A person reveals his character by nothing so clearly as the joke he resents.","Men still have to be governed by deception.","One must judge men not by their opinions, but by what their opinions have made of them.","God created man in His own image, says the Bible; philosophers reverse the process: they create God in theirs.","He who is in love with himself has at least this advantage - he won't encounter many rivals.","What is the good of drawing conclusions from experience? I don't deny we sometimes draw the right conclusions, but don't we just as often draw the wrong ones?","We cannot remember too often that when we observe nature, and especially the ordering of nature, it is always ourselves alone we are observing.","If all else fails, the character of a man can be recognized by nothing so surely as by a jest which he takes badly.","I believe that man is in the last resort so free a being that his right to be what he believes himself to be cannot be contested.","Prejudices are so to speak the mechanical instincts of men: through their prejudices they do without any effort many things they would find too difficult to think through to the point of resolving to do them.","There are very many people who read simply to prevent themselves from thinking.","There is no greater impediment to progress in the sciences than the desire to see it take place too quickly.","To do the opposite of something is also a form of imitation, namely an imitation of its opposite.","Nothing can contribute more to peace of soul than the lack of any opinion whatever.","Nothing makes one old so quickly as the ever-present thought that one is growing older.","Virtue by premeditation isn't worth much.","The sure conviction that we could if we wanted to is the reason so many good minds are idle.","A book is a mirror: if an ape looks into it an apostle is hardly likely to look out.","To err is human also in so far as animals seldom or never err, or at least only the cleverest of them do so.","We accumulate our opinions at an age when our understanding is at its weakest.","That man is the noblest creature may also be inferred from the fact that no other creature has yet contested this claim.","I am convinced we do not only love ourselves in others but hate ourselves in others too.","We are obliged to regard many of our original minds as crazy at least until we have become as clever as they are.","With prophecies the commentator is often a more important man than the prophet.","The American who first discovered Columbus made a bad discovery.","Nowadays three witty turns of phrase and a lie make a writer.","With most people disbelief in a thing is founded on a blind belief in some other thing.","We say that someone occupies an official position, whereas it is the official position that occupies him.","It is a question whether, when we break a murderer on the wheel, we do not fall into the error a child makes when it hits the chair it has bumped into.","It is almost everywhere the case that soon after it is begotten the greater part of human wisdom is laid to rest in repositories.","It is in the gift for employing all the vicissitudes of life to one's own advantage and to that of one's craft that a large part of genius consists.","With a pen in my hand I have successfully stormed bulwarks from which others armed with sword and excommunication have been repulsed.","There exists a species of transcendental ventriloquism by means of which men can be made to believe that something said on earth comes from Heaven.","Delight at having understood a very abstract and obscure system leads most people to believe in the truth of what it demonstrates.","What is called an acute knowledge of human nature is mostly nothing but the observer's own weaknesses reflected back from others.","There are people who possess not so much genius as a certain talent for perceiving the desires of the century, or even of the decade, before it has done so itself.","When an acquaintance goes by I often step back from my window, not so much to spare him the effort of acknowledging me as to spare myself the embarrassment of seeing that he has not done so.","Actual aristocracy cannot be abolished by any law: all the law can do is decree how it is to be imparted and who is to acquire it.","The pleasures of the imagination are as it were only drawings and models which are played with by poor people who cannot afford the real thing.","One might call habit a moral friction: something that prevents the mind from gliding over things but connects it with them and makes it hard for it to free itself from them.","To receive applause for works which do not demand all our powers hinders our advance towards a perfecting of our spirit. It usually means that thereafter we stand still.","To be content with life or to live merrily, rather all that is required is that we bestow on all things only a fleeting, superficial glance; the more thoughtful we become the more earnest we grow.","The human tendency to regard little things as important has produced very many great things.","To grow wiser means to learn to know better and better the faults to which this instrument with which we feel and judge can be subject.","If the little bit you have is nothing special in itself, at least find a way of saying it that is a little bit special.","The noble simplicity in the works of nature only too often originates in the noble shortsightedness of him who observes it.","If people should ever start to do only what is necessary millions would die of hunger.","Erudition can produce foliage without bearing fruit.","Man is to be found in reason, God in the passions.","The most perfect ape cannot draw an ape; only man can do that; but, likewise, only man regards the ability to do this as a sign of superiority."],"Georg Cantor":["The essence of mathematics lies in its freedom.","In mathematics the art of proposing a question must be held of higher value than solving it.","A set is a Many that allows itself to be thought of as a One.","I realise that in this undertaking I place myself in a certain opposition to views widely held concerning the mathematical infinite and to opinions frequently defended on the nature of numbers."],"Georg Groddeck":["One must not forget that recovery is brought about not by the physician, but by the sick man himself. He heals himself, by his own power, exactly as he walks by means of his own power, or eats, or thinks, breathes or sleeps.","Disease is a vital expression of the human organism."],"Georg Henrik von Wright":["If one is satisfied with things, one doesn't complain about the downsides that exist, either.","Society is becoming less and less transparent. People no longer know where decisions that substantially affect their lives are taken, nor by whom, nor how.","Transnational, gigantic industrial companies no longer operate within political systems, but rather above them."],"Georg Hermes":["Death is like an arrow that is already in flight, and your life lasts only until it reaches you.","The soul passeth from form to form; and the mansions of her pilgrimage are manifold.","Not all human souls but only the pious ones are divine.","From one Soul of the Universe are all Souls derived."],"Georg Simmel":["In order to accommodate to change and to the contrast of phenomena, the intellect does not require any shocks and inner upheavals; it is only through such upheavals that the more conservative mind could accommodate to the metropolitan rhythm of events.","Secrecy sets barriers between men, but at the same time offers the seductive temptation to break through the barriers by gossip or confession.","The deepest problems of modern life derive from the claim of the individual to preserve the autonomy and individuality of his existence in the face of overwhelming social forces, of historical heritage, of external culture, and of the technique of life.","The individual has become a mere cog in an enormous organization of things and powers which tear from his hands all progress, spirituality, and value in order to transform them from their subjective form into the form of a purely objective life.","For this reason, strangers are not really conceived as individuals, but as strangers of a particular type: the element of distance is no less general in regard to them than the element of nearness.","For, to be a stranger is naturally a very positive relation; it is a specific form of interaction.","Modern culture is constantly growing more objective. Its tissues grow more and more out of impersonal energies, and absorb less and less the subjective entirety of the individual.","Every relationship between two individuals or two groups will be characterized by the ratio of secrecy that is involved in it.","For the metropolis presents the peculiar conditions which are revealed to us as the opportunities and the stimuli for the development of both these ways of allocating roles to men.","Every relationship between persons causes a picture of each to take form in the mind of the other, and this picture evidently is in reciprocal relationship with that personal relationship.","Thus, the technique of metropolitan life is unimaginable without the most punctual integration of all activities and mutual relations into a stable and impersonal time schedule.","On the one hand, life is made infinitely easy for the personality in that stimulations, interests, uses of time and consciousness are offered to it from all sides. They carry the person as if in a stream, and one needs hardly to swim for oneself.","The first internal relation that is essential to a secret society is the reciprocal confidence of its members.","The intellectually sophisticated person is indifferent to all genuine individuality, because relationships and reactions result from it which cannot be exhausted with logical operations.","The metropolis has always been the seat of the money economy.","The metropolis reveals itself as one of those great historical formations in which opposing streams which enclose life unfold, as well as join one another with equal right.","Secrecy is thus, so to speak, a transition stadium between being and not-being.","Cities are, first of all, seats of the highest economic division of labor.","Discretion is nothing other than the sense of justice with respect to the sphere of the intimate contents of life.","Every superior personality, and every superior performance, has, for the average of mankind, something mysterious.","For the division of labor demands from the individual an ever more one-sided accomplishment, and the greatest advance in a one-sided pursuit only too frequently means dearth to the personality of the individual.","In the latter case life rests upon a thousand presuppositions which the individual can never trace back to their origins, and verify; but which he must accept upon faith and belief.","Man's nature, originally good and common to all, should develop unhampered.","Secrecy involves a tension which, at the moment of revelation, finds its release.","The earliest phase of social formations found in historical as well as in contemporary social structures is this: a relatively small circle firmly closed against neighboring, strange, or in some way antagonistic circles.","The psychological basis of the metropolitan type of individuality consists in the intensification of nervous stimulation which results from the swift and uninterrupted change of outer and inner stimuli."],"Georg Solti":["My entire learning process is slow, because I have no visual memory.","The academy gave me a grounding in discipline and hard work that has sustained me throughout my life, and the lessons I learned there I now try to impress on young people.","Although both sides of my family were religious, I was never forced to practice the Jewish faith. I did not really rebel against it, but then, as today, I disliked organized religion. I have a strange inhibition about praying with others.","The stag tells him that he is the eldest of the sons - the father's favorite - and he warns the father that if he tries to shoot any of the stags, their antlers will tear him to pieces.","During the first six years of my life, Hungary was one of the most important components of the Habsburg dynasty's vast Austro-Hungarian Empire, but after World War I it became an independent national entity.","Friends are very important to me, and I have always had many of them. There are probably many reasons why this is so, but two seem to me more valid than any of the others I am a naturally friendly person, and I hate to be alone.","I can only hope that neither of my daughters was scarred by their upbringing.","I wanted to get away from my past and everything connected with it.","I was born and trained to communicate music, just as the sons were born and trained to hunt, and I was lucky to have grown up in Hungary, a country that lives and breathes music-that has a passionate belief in the power of music as a celebration of life.","But one day, when I was still young, I was parted from my family and left my native country. I hunted and searched for music, and destiny turned me into the object of my hunt. The circumstances of life became my 'antlers' and prevented me from returning home.","I would never have become music director of the Chicago Symphony, which would have been an extremely sad loss.","The experience awakened 'my tremendous musical ambition, which has never subsided to this day.","After about six months, I told my mother that I wanted the lessons to stop, and she was intelligent enough not to force me to continue. Besides, the lessons cost money, which was anything but abundant in our household."],"Georg Stanford Brown":["One of the things about being a minority actor is that you don't have that opportunity as some of your counterparts to keep that flow, to constantly be going from one thing to the other, so when you see really great performances out there by some black folks, you know it's coming from somewhere deep, because they just don't work as much.","For me, acting was something I fell into.","For the majority of my career, I've been surprised that I've been able to sustain any kind of a plan. I was always happy to have the job, and I was having a good time. I was growing. But I don't feel all that strongly about my work."],"Georg Trakl":["I drank the silence of God from a spring in the woods.","The near stillness recalls what is forgotten, extinct angels.","The blue of my eyes is extinguished in this night, the red gold of my heart.","Earlier lives drift by on silver soles, and the shadows of the damned descend into these sighing waters.","For whoever is lonely there is a tavern.","The guilt of newborns is immense.","Shuddering under the autumn stars, each year, the head sinks lower and lower.","Silently, God opens his golden eyes over the place of skulls.","Black frost. The ground is hard, the air tastes bitter. Your stars cluster in evil signs.","When we are thirsty, we drink the white waters of the pool, the sweetness of our mournful childhood."],"Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel":["Nothing great in the world has ever been accomplished without passion.","The learner always begins by finding fault, but the scholar sees the positive merit in everything.","Genuine tragedies in the world are not conflicts between right and wrong. They are conflicts between two rights.","The history of the world is none other than the progress of the consciousness of freedom.","All that is real is reasonable, and all that is reasonable is real.","Mere goodness can achieve little against the power of nature.","I'm not ugly, but my beauty is a total creation.","When liberty is mentioned, we must always be careful to observe whether it is not really the assertion of private interests which is thereby designated.","Governments have never learned anything from history, or acted on principles deducted from it.","It is easier to discover a deficiency in individuals, in states, and in Providence, than to see their real import and value.","Education is the art of making man ethical.","Truth in philosophy means that concept and external reality correspond.","Too fair to worship, too divine to love.","World history is a court of judgment.","Mark this well, you proud men of action! you are, after all, nothing but unconscious instruments of the men of thought.","Once the state has been founded, there can no longer be any heroes. They come on the scene only in uncivilized conditions.","Animals are in possession of themselves; their soul is in possession of their body. But they have no right to their life, because they do not will it.","An idea is always a generalization, and generalization is a property of thinking. To generalize means to think.","We do not need to be shoemakers to know if our shoes fit, and just as little have we any need to be professionals to acquire knowledge of matters of universal interest.","To him who looks upon the world rationally, the world in its turn presents a rational aspect. The relation is mutual.","Amid the pressure of great events, a general principle gives no help.","The Few assume to be the deputies, but they are often only the despoilers of the Many."],"George A. Moore":["A man travels the world over in search of what he needs and returns home to find it.","Taking something from one man and making it worse is plagiarism.","The truth is that I am in love with Dublin. I think it is the most beautiful town that I have ever seen, mountains at the back and the sea in front, and long roads winding through decaying suburbs and beautiful woods.","A man of letters never objects to a slum. He sharpens his pen there.","The wrong way always seems the more reasonable.","Some men spend their lives watching bees and ants, noting down the habits of these insects; my pleasure is to watch the human mind, noting how unselfish instincts rise to the surface and sink back again, making way for selfish instincts, each equally necessary, for the world would perish were it to become entirely selfish or entirely unselfish.","The difficulty in life is the choice.","Remorse: beholding heaven and feeling hell.","Dublin dwindles so beautifully; there is no harsh separation between it and the country. It fades away, whereas London seems to devour the country; an army of buildings come and take away a beautiful park, and you never seem to get quite out of sight of a row of houses.","'The Dublin Magazine' has been edited with good taste, and it is very agreeable reading, but to speak quite candidly, I do not believe in the future of any literary journal any more than I believe in the future of the Trinity.","Reality can destroy the dream; why shouldn't the dream destroy reality?","An idea is so impersonal; it is yours today and the whole world's tomorrow.","You will find in me a middle aged man with a career behind me sufficiently brilliant to enable me to talk about many things interestingly; and I am not an unkindly soul, I believe.","The right I claim is that of every human being to speak what he believes to be the truth to whomever he may meet on his way.","England produced Shakespeare, and the British Empire the six-shilling novel.","Art must be parochial in the beginning to be cosmopolitan in the end.","Everybody sets out to do something, and everybody does something, but no one does what he sets out to do.","The right of property holds good in all society; but in the West, ethics invade the personal life in a manner unknown to the East, so much so that the Oriental stands agape at our folly, knowing well that every man brings different instincts and ideas into the world with him.","To what better purpose can a man's energy be devoted, and his talents, than the resuscitation of his country's language?","Men never get free from morality, only women.","Every race gets the religion it deserves, and only as policemen, pugilists, and priests have they succeeded, here and there a successful lawyer, but nothing more serious.","An idea has been running in my head that books lose and gain qualities in the course of time, and I have worried over it a good deal, for what seemed to be a paradox, I felt to be a truth.","I have written 30,000 words in a month - think of it - 30,000! I hope I am putting the right number of naughts: an average of a thousand words a day! For thirty days!","I do not believe in a universal religion any more than I believe in a universal language. My feeling is that people have to make their own religion as they have to make their arts and their parishes, and that they must find their own salvation; the salvation mongers are of not much avail.","Isn't it strange that religious prejudices - beliefs none possess, not even the saints, so they have lamented - divide brothers and sons from their fathers. You see, I except mothers and sisters; the female is not a religious animal. If she were, the world would have ceased long ago."],"George A. Romero":["A zombie film is not fun without a bunch of stupid people running around and observing how they fail to handle the situation.","Zombies are always moving fast in video games. It makes sense if you think about it. Those games are all about hand-eye coordination and how quickly can you get them before they get you.","For a Catholic kid in parochial school, the only way to survive the beatings - by classmates, not the nuns - was to be the funny guy.","Some directors work from day to day. I work from moment to moment.","As movie monsters go, zombies are the most human. They were human at one time. So we are confronted with ourselves in a way, which is much more frightening and disturbing.","The grotesque has never really affected or frightened me. I guess it's real-life stuff that frightens me much more.","The horror films that I've made have been satirical in one way or another or political, and I really think that's the purpose of horror. I don't see that happening very often.","My zombie films were all sort of satirical, with political messages. So I was doing them inexpensively and quietly off in left field somewhere.","I expect a zombie to show up on 'Sesame Street' soon, teaching kids to count.","I can't really make fun of zombies. They're not liars. They're not cheats.","There aren't that many monsters. It's very hard to create a new monster.","I'm like my zombies. I won't stay dead!","My stories are about humans and how they react, or fail to react, or react stupidly. I'm pointing the finger at us, not at the zombies. I try to respect and sympathize with the zombies as much as possible.","I also have always liked the monster within idea. I like the zombies being us. Zombies are the blue-collar monsters.","Nothing's ever real until it's real.","I sympathize with the zombies and am not even sure they are villains. To me they are this earth-changing thing. God or the devil changed the rules, and dead people are not staying dead.","When you're shooting super-low-budget - we had 20 days to shoot 'Diary,' and a little over $2 - time is money.","Comic books and radio were my escape. I even remember 3-D comic books where you put on the red-and-green glasses and Mighty Mouse would punch you in the face. It was the literature of the day for kids my age who were too bored with listening to 'Peter and the Wolf' on the record player.","I remember when John Cameron Swayze over the television told me personally that the Russians now had the atomic bomb; then I knew that we were goners.","If I fail, the film industry writes me off as another statistic. If I succeed, they pay me a million bucks to fly out to Hollywood and fart.","I saw 'Dracula,' 'Frankenstein,' 'The Wolf Man,' 'The Invisible Man.' I saw all those guys on the big screen at RKO in the Bronx. I just always loved that stuff. I loved other stuff, too. That's the thing. That wasn't all I wanted to be.","The 'Dead' films allow me to talk about things that a drama, say, won't. 'Dawn Of The Dead,' which was set in a shopping mall, is on one level about consumerism; 'Land Of The Dead' is a response to Bush.","The guy that made me wanna make movies... and this is off the wall-is a guy named Michael Pal, the British director.","After 'Land,' I wanted to do something about emerging media and citizen journalism, so I got this idea for 'Diary of the Dead.'","I did 'Land of the Dead,' which was the biggest zombie film I had ever made. I don't think it needed to be that big. That money went largely to the cast. They were great, but I don't think that money needed to be spent.","I used to be able to pitch them on the basis of the zombie action, and I could hide the message inside that. Now, you can't. The moment you mention the word 'zombie,' it's got to be, 'Hey, Brad Pitt paid $400 million to do that.'","A lot of my friends are people who do horror films: Wes Craven, John Carpenter, Stephen King.","Collaborate, don't dictate.","Nursery rhymes were political when they were first written! To me, that's what it's about: it's about using it to say something more than just what the story is.","If one horror film hits, everyone says, 'Let's go make a horror film.' It's the genre that never dies.","There are so many factors when you think of your own films. You think of the people you worked on it with, and somehow forget the movie. You can't forgive the movie for a long time. It takes a few years to look at it with any objectivity and forgive its flaws.","As great as Ed is, the wisdom out here is that he can't carry a movie. They'll pay him $3 million to be the second banana in Julia Roberts things. But they won't put up $3 million for an Ed Harris movie.","I like guys who are understandable and good guys who are flawed.","As a filmmaker you get typecast just as much as an actor does, so I'm trapped in a genre that I love, but I'm trapped in it!","I thought Godzilla was a mess, the monster had no character and the humans didn't either. They forgot to make the movie that went along with all these wonderful effects.","I think you're only free if you're working on very low or huge money.","The most realistic blood I've seen is when Marlon Brando gets beat up in On The Waterfront.","I really believe that you could do horror very inexpensively. I don't think it has anything to do with the effects, the effects are not the most important parts.","I don't think you need to spend $40 million to be creepy. The best horror films are the ones that are much less endowed.","I always thought of the zombies as being about revolution, one generation consuming the next.","I'll never get sick of zombies. I just get sick of producers.","I really liked the helicopter pilot in 'Dawn of the Dead', when he gets bitten and comes out of the elevator. That guy was amazing. He did this incredible walk that we didn't even know about until we started shooting.","Movies are about escape.","People called '28 Days' and '28 Weeks' zombie movies, and they're not! It's some sort of virus; they're not dead.","First of all, in the old days, if you wanted to show someone getting shot on film, all you could do was place an effect in the original take. And if you wanted to brighten somebody's face and leave the rest of the room dark, that was a very expensive process.","I keep a little notebook of things that I can do to the zombies that might be silly and fun.","I grew up on the old EC comic books before the Comics Code in North American and with all sort of good-natured fun. I never had nightmares I think because all of the old horror stuff that I was exposed to was well meaning in a certain sense.","Horror will always be there, it always comes back, it's a familiar genre that some people, not everyone - it's sort of the cinema anchovies. You either like it or you don't.","Somehow I've been able to keep standing and stay in my little corner and do my little stuff and I'm not particularly affected by trends or I'm not dying to make a 3D movie or anything like that. I'm just sort of happy to still be around.","Ever since 'Lassie' and 'Old Yeller', I won't watch animal movies. Animals in movies always die.","I grew up on DC Comics, moral tales where the bad guys got their comeuppance. To me the gory panels or grotesque stuff just made me chuckle.","The two great things about computer CG stuff are I can now do gags I would never have dreamed of in the old day.","I don't like the new trends in horror. All this torture stuff seems really mean-spirited. People have forgotten how to laugh, and I don't see anybody who's using it as allegory.","'The Thing from Another World' was the first movie that really scared me.","When I was old enough to go to movies alone, I got to see 'Frankenstein' and 'Dracula' on the big screen. I just fell in love with them.","My zombies will never take over the world because I need the humans. The humans are the ones I dislike the most, and they're where the trouble really lies.","On the other side of that coin, and far outweighing it, is the fact that I've been able to use genre of Fantasy/Horror and express my opinion, talk a little about society, do a little bit of satire and that's been great, man. A lot of people don't have that platform.","I go to conventions and universities and talk to young filmmakers and everybody's making a zombie movie! It's because it's easy to get the neighbors to come out, put some ketchup on them.","What the Internet's value is that you have access to information but you also have access to every lunatic that's out there that wants to throw up a blog.","Anybody who tunes into Rush Limabaugh already knows what he's going to say and is already inclined to agree. So it winds up creating tribes.","I've only actually done one studio film. I want to be left alone.","I'm telling you, man, after I did 'Land of the Dead,' which Mark Canton produced, Universal picked it up, and I had to use stars. I didn't think I needed stars - Dennis Hopper was in it. I loved him. We hung out. I loved him, but his cigar budget was more than we paid for the entire budget of 'Night of the Living Dead.'","My films, I've tried to put a message into them. It's not about the gore; it's not about the horror element that are in them. It's more about the message, for me. That's what it is, and I'm using this platform to be able to show my feelings of what I think.","I wanted 'Night of the Living Dead' to look naturalistic, but we weren't able to do it because we were shooting with a blimped 35mm camera, which is automatically static.","I've made six zombie films; I've tried consciously to make each one different from the next.","Film is a very expensive medium.","'Martin' is my favorite film of mine and 'Knightriders' a close second.","My stuff is my stuff. I do it for my own reasons, using my own peculiar set of guidelines.","There are very few horror films that I think are worth their salt.","I'd love to make a film like 'Pan's Labyrinth.'","'The Thing from Another World' was the first movie that really scared me. But the one that made me want to make movies was 'The Tales of Hoffman.' That's my favorite film of all time. It's a fantasy film. It's an opera. I never get tired of it.","When we made 'Night of the Living Dead,' we got riddled. There was this famous article Roger Ebert wrote just blasting the film because he had gone to see it at some screening where there were all these kids in the audience. I don't know why that happened. We didn't make the movie for kids.","One thing about a film production is that it must run efficiently; there is no room for dead wood. So somebody that hangs around by the coffee wagon won't get hired again, but somebody who is dedicated and works hard and really puts out will get noticed by the people that matter around there and will get asked to come back again.","The very fact that you thought of it means that, somewhere in your mind, it's believable to you. All you have to do is convince your audience that it's possible.","I've seen so many young filmmakers - even professional filmmakers who get a Hollywood deal - they don't quite know where to begin, where to end, and they'll waste a lot of time making this perfect shot, an establishing shot, and then there's no time left to shoot the dialogue.","I love a couple of Fulci things. I just had a gas watching them. It's not what I would do, but I loved watching them. They were fun.","I don't want to do 'Beyond the Planet of the Apes.' I don't want a zombie society. I don't want to go that far.","I always have CNN on. That's where I get my ideas.","I'm amazed. I go to these conventions, and the fans that come, sometimes my line goes all day.","The zombie was just an intriguing character; it is a sympathetic character.","I do think of my films as morality plays, even though my reputation is, you know, splatter films and like that. But I think of them as very moral.","I want 'Dawn' to play like a cowboys and Indians movie.","With CG, I can do more and be sillier. In 'Diary,' there's a scene where they hit a guy with acid, and the camera is never off him, and you see it gradually eat through his skull and get all the way through his brain. That's fun, too.","I grew up on EC comic books and 'Tales From the Crypt,' which were all loaded with humor, bad jokes, and puns. I can have that kind of fun and make these comic book movies but, at the same time, talk about things I want to talk about - whether it's consumerism or the Bush administration or war.","I like to use horror as allegory.","I guess my stuff needs to grow on people. Too bad! That seems to happen with all of it.","There is something about the sameness people like. And what I've tried to do with all the zombie films is purposely make them different. That may be part of why it takes so long for people to see what it's intended to be.","At the time we did 'Night,' I was a director of television commercials. Some of them cost a lot more than our whole movie. They were very slick, sophisticated... we wanted the opposite look for 'Night.' We wanted it to look like a newsreel.","With 'Dawn,' I wanted the slick look; I wanted to bring out the nature of the shopping center, the retail displays, the mannequins. There are times when maybe you reflect that the mannequins are more attractive but less real - less sympathetic, even - than the zombies. Put those kinds of images side by side, and you raise all sorts of questions.","I didn't much care for the 'Dawn' remake. It was a well-made action movie but really wasn't anything like my 'Dawn Of The Dead.'","I liked the '28 Days Later' films, but they're not zombies; they're not dead. They're not using it in the same way.","If you look to the few films that have been really successful, 'Insidious,' 'Paranormal Activity,' it's all basically the old monsters.","The hardest thing when you're making a zombie movie is, 'How am I going to kill these zombies? I need a clever way to knock these guys off.'","I love 'Shaun of the Dead.'","Basically, I'm an EC comic book guy, man. You can show me anything that's high-spirited horror, and I'll be there giggling.","You can get an audience no matter what your opinion is.","You just wish you could lobotomize yourself and just do a thing that's really on instinct. There's always a certain self-consciousness. And you worry about that.","People say you're trapped in this genre. You're a horror guy. I say wait a minute - I'm able to say exactly what I think. I'm able to talk about, comment about, take snapshots of what's going on at the time. I don't feel trapped. I feel like this is my way of being able to express myself.","Is Michael Moore an honest documentarian? Honestly? I don't think he is... The real discussion gets left behind the entertainment value.","I have a very quiet life. There's nothing weird.","My film collection is all oldies.","I sit around listening to classical music. I don't play video games. I love to go to dinner, go on picnics, travel.","If I go to a movie and it's particularly violent, and people are leaving the theatre ready to vomit, we're sitting there with our popcorn just chuckling.","In 2007, 'Diary of the Dead' all of a sudden made money. I was blindsided by that.","Because of 'World War Z' and 'The Walking Dead,' I can't pitch a modest little zombie film which is meant to be sociopolitical.","When you are working with low budgets and you have a gunshot with a squib and it goes wrong - the gun flash does not synchronize with the squib or whatever - it takes half an hour or 40 minutes to clean it all up and reset it. It's much easier to use a computer to paint in the flash and splatter.","I will never make a film where zombies are threatening to take over the planet.","The main thing people took from 'Night of the Living Dead' was that it was a racial statement movie, and that was completely unintended.","I won't say I'm uncompromising, but I won't compromise just for the hell of it.","Pittsburgh, for a while, became a production centre. There was one $400 million year. Hollywood was bringing productions in there. Films like 'The Silence of the Lambs' and 'Innocent Blood.' So my guys, the guys I worked with, were able to have careers and live at home. But then it dried up, and a lot of my friends left.","'Day of the Dead' remains my favourite zombie film of mine.","Most of my stuff was sort of of-the-time. 'The Crazies' was, basically, we were angry about Vietnam, and it had a reason for being.","When you're working with a low budget, the most expensive time is the time spent on the set. The words of the day are, 'Get off the set as quickly as possible,' and so CG enables you to do that.","Neighbors are frightening enough when they're alive.","I'm basically a fairly traditional filmmaker.","Horror films are the anchovies of the cinema. Either you like them, or you don't.","I've never had a zombie eat a brain! I don't know where that comes from. Who says zombies eat brains?","To me, the zombies have always just been zombies. They've always been a cigar. When I first made 'Night of the Living Dead,' it got analyzed and overanalyzed way out of proportion. The zombies were written about as if they represented Nixon's Silent Majority or whatever. But I never thought about it that way.","I go to these horror conventions all the time, and these audiences get so deep into it. They've pulled apart every movie fifty ways from Sunday.","When I was growing up, I actually went through, in New York City, blackouts when we had to close the windows and worry about air raids. I don't know whether or not those were realistic worries or not, but as a kid, when we all had to run around pulling down the drapes and turning the lights off; it was a very frightening experience.","I grew up in New York City. And I lived in the Bronx in a place called Parkchester.","I'm more alarmed by people reacting violently to the violence in my films than I am by the violence in films.","Zombies cannot run.","Zombies are my ticket to ride! It's how I get a deal! I don't care what they are. I don't care where they came from.","Zombies to me don't represent anything in particular. They are a global disaster that people don't know how to deal with.","In the old days, there were three networks, and all of a sudden, Walter Cronkite is the most trusted man in America. Everybody believes what he says, not even thinking. In those days, we didn't even know it was being spun. We were very willing to just listen to it and go along with.","For me, tribalism and religion are basically the big reasons we're in trouble. Patriotism, tribalism, and religion.","I'm a Turner Classic Movies guy. That's it. I'd much rather sit here and watch an oldie than anything new.","I vote in the Academy, so I get all the screeners. I'm so often disappointed by all the material and especially by what wins. I find myself never voting for the winner.","The only advice you can give is, 'Don't let the bad stuff keep you down.'","Back then, in 1968, everything was suspect - family, government, and obviously the family unit in 'Night of the Living Dead' completely collapses. That's what we were focused on.","I have a soft spot in my heart for the zombies.","'Night of the Living Dead,' then 'Dawn of the Dead' is a few weeks later, 'Day of the Dead' months later, and 'Land of the Dead' is three years later. Each one spoke about a different decade and was stylistically different."],"George A. Sheehan":["Success means having the courage, the determination, and the will to become the person you believe you were meant to be.","We may think there is willpower involved, but more likely... change is due to want power. Wanting the new addiction more than the old one. Wanting the new me in preference to the person I am now.","The mind's first step to self-awareness must be through the body.","Happiness is different from pleasure. Happiness has something to do with struggling and enduring and accomplishing.","Exercise is done against one's wishes and maintained only because the alternative is worse.","If you want to win anything - a race, yourself, your life - you have to go a little berserk.","Anything that changes your values changes your behavior."],"George A. Smith":["Our enemies are our evil deeds and their memories, our pride, our selfishness, our malice, our passions, which by conscience or by habit pursue us with a relentlessness past the power of figure to express.","We must seek the loving-kindness of God in all the breadth and open-air of common life.","Man does find in Nature deliverance from himself, oblivion of his past, with peace and purity!","Power and position often make a man trifle with the truth.","The heart which finds life in material wealth is usually certain to go farther and seek for more in the satisfaction of base and sullen appetites.","The seasons come up undisturbed by crime and war.","Yet none use their words more recklessly than the strong, who have not been sobered by the rebuffs and uncertainties of life.","Happiness, contentment, the health and growth of the soul, depend, as men have proved over and over again, upon some simple issue, some single turning of the soul.","To us sin has not become any less of a mystery or a pain.","If we have a heart for the magnitudes of life, it will not seem vain to believe that God Himself should guard it.","Into every soul, however purged and fenced, evil appears to have as much freedom of entrance as God Himself.","Jesus Christ tells us that a man cannot be wrong if he argues towards God from what he finds best in himself.","Lives are changed by a moment's listening to conscience, by a single and quiet inclination of the mind.","Let those who, still in their youth, have preserved their faith and fullness of hope, keep looking up.","There is no truth which the prophets press more steadily upon Israel than that all their national life lies in the sight and on the care of God.","God is stronger than their strength, more loving than their uttermost love, and in so far as they have loved and sacrificed themselves for others, they have obtained the infallible proof, that God too lives and loves and gives Himself away.","The whole mystery of temptation is to have sins suggested to us, and to be swept after them by a sudden enthusiasm, which sometimes feels as strong as the Spirit of God ever made in us the enthusiasm for virtue."],"George Ade":["To insure peace of mind ignore the rules and regulations.","One man's poison ivy is another man's spinach.","In the city a funeral is just an interruption of traffic; in the country it is a form of popular entertainment.","A good jolly is worth what you pay for it.","Anybody can win - unless there happens to be a second entry.","A man never feels more important than when he receives a telegram containing more than ten words.","After being Turned Down by numerous Publishers, he had decided to write for Posterity.","For parlor use, the vague generality is a life saver.","A friend who is near and dear may in time become as useless as a relative.","She was short on intellect, but long on shape.","Nothing is improbable until it moves into past tense.","Do unto yourself as your neighbors do unto themselves and look pleasant.","It is not time for mirth and laughter, the cold, gray dawn of the morning after.","If it were not for the presents, an elopement would be preferable.","The time to enjoy a European trip is about three weeks after unpacking.","Only the more rugged mortals should attempt to keep up with current literature.","Early to bed and early to rise is a bad rule for anyone who wishes to become acquainted with our most prominent and influential people."],"George Aiken":["If we were to wake up some morning and find that everyone was the same race, creed and color, we would find some other causes for prejudice by noon.","True conservation provides for wise use by the general public.

And if you don't behave according to your identity, you pay a cost.","The whole intention of empirical economics is to force theory down to Earth.","Keynesian economics has always been needed.","When you give chief executives too much compensation in stock options, they concentrate too much on the stock price, and there is a perverse incentive to raise the stock price, particularly when the chief executive wants to exercise his own options.","My Swedish grandmother was the daughter of a dairy farmer who lived near Hedemora. My Swedish grandfather worked as a clerk for the Swedish railways in the Stockholm station.","I would never have been a good reporter because I am not accurate regarding facts.","Parents don't take a baby's temperature to decide whether the room is too warm; likewise, for global warming, we need a story that spurs us to do what is necessary.","I think what Bob Shiller and I are doing is we're focusing on macroeconomics and the role of psychology in macroeconomics.","I've always been a macroeconomist. That's what I teach. And I guess that's what I've been concerned with ever since I've been very young.","The only way we are going to ameliorate pressing social needs is through public intervention.","When men do all the outside work, they contribute on average about 10 percent of housework. But as their share of outside work falls, their share of housework rises to no more than 37 percent.","My father was a chemist on the Yale faculty, my mother a housewife.","My mother, whose interest in chemistry was rather minimal, nevertheless went to graduate school in the subject and married my father, for whom it was as important as life itself.","My brother Carl became a physicist; I became an economist.","The failure of credit markets is one of the major reasons for underdevelopment.","In the late 1960s, the New Classical economists saw the same weaknesses in the microfoundations of macroeconomics that have motivated me. They hated its lack of rigor. And they sacked it.","Prior to the early 1960s, economic theorists rarely constructed models customized to capture unique institutions or specific market characteristics.","In New Classical theory, periods of declining employment - business cycle downturns - may be caused by an unexpected decline in aggregate demand, which leaves workers mistakenly holding out for nominal wages that exceed the new market-clearing level."],"George Allen, Sr.":["Work hard, stay positive, and get up early. It's the best part of the day.","Forget the past - the future will give you plenty to worry about.","One of the most difficult things everyone has to learn is that for your entire life you must keep fighting and adjusting if you hope to survive. No matter who you are or what your position is you must keep fighting for whatever it is you desire to achieve.","If you want to catch more fish, use more hooks.","Success is what you do with your ability. It's how you use your talent.","Every time you win, you're reborn; when you lose, you die a little.","Every day you waste is one you can never make up.","Each of us has been put on earth with the ability to do something well. We cheat ourselves and the world if we don't use that ability as best we can.","Winning is the science of being totally prepared.","The tougher the job, the greater the reward.","People of mediocre ability sometimes achieve outstanding success because they don't know when to quit. Most men succeed because they are determined to.","The achiever is the only individual who is truly alive.","Try not to do too many things at once. Know what you want, the number one thing today and tomorrow. Persevere and get it done.","Persevere and get it done.","Leisure time is that five or six hours when you sleep at night.","The street to obscurity is paved with athletes who can perform great feats before friendly crowds.","When we get to the future, I'll determine the future."],"George Allen":["We should favor innovation and freedom over regulation.","I like to motivate and inspire people.","In some ways, September 11, 2001, seems a long time ago. Yet we have done so much in only a few years, and we will continue to do so in the future, to prevent such attacks on America.","We are so appreciative of the men and women in uniform who are protecting us, whether in Afghanistan or Iraq or on ships around the world. For our security, they are taking the offensive to the terrorists overseas.","It is vital that the United States maintains open lines of communication with our allies. We must assure them of our commitment to eradicating global terrorism wherever it may reside or wherever it's given haven.","The idea of reasoning with terrorists without force or with appeasement is naive, and I think it's dangerous.","I have always advocated for funding and programs that increase our productivity and competitiveness.","I rise today to offer a formal and heartfelt apology to all the victims of lynching in our history, and for the failure of the United States Senate to take action when action was most needed.","We're going to hear a lot of spirited discussion about the President's plan in the next few days and weeks and that's fine as long as everyone comes ready to talk and not just snipe, complain and argue.","Most Americans recognize that whatever the government program is, no matter how essential it is, it's waste.","The people of America need personal responsibility and freedom, not dependency on the government.","I do think that the elections of 2010 and 2012 are going to determine the trajectory of the country. Either we're going to be aspiring and improving opportunities based on freedom and responsibility, or we're going to go down the path that dictates and mandates a dependency on government.","Trust free people and free enterprise as opposed to meddling, burdensome government.","I think you always have to be innovating and adapting and improving. You can't stay the same.","I have no intention of running for office again.","My mother is French-Italian with a little Spanish blood in her. I've been raised, and she was, as far as I know, raised as a Christian.","I don't like talking about myself. I don't like talking about these introspective things.","I did learn that some of the things that are great for locker rooms are inappropriate for political discourse. That's a wisdom I've garnered.","China owns more of our bonds than do Americans. That's not a good position to be in.","It's time for an American comeback... where leaders in Washington listen to 'we the people.'","Before I was governor, tuition was skyrocketing, and we stopped that. We capped and then we froze college tuition.","Election Day 2010 saw the culmination of years of aggravation and resentment toward a federal government that became disconnected and disdainful of the values and priorities of Americans.","When I was elected Governor, we had an audacious agenda that naysayers said couldn't be enacted with a Democrat majority in the state legislature. However, we worked across party lines and enacted historic reforms. Working together, we cut taxes by more than $600 million."],"George Andrew Olah":["My Cleveland years were both scientifically and personally most rewarding. My wife Judy was able to rejoin me in our research and my research group grew rapidly.","My father was a lawyer and to my best knowledge nobody in my family before had interest in science.","I grew up between the two world wars and received a rather solid general education, the kind middle class children enjoyed in a country whose educational system had its roots dating back to the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.","Although reading the classics in Latin in school may be not as fulfilling as it would be at a more mature age, few scientists can afford the time for such diversion later in life.","I was invited to join the newly established Central Chemical Research Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1954 and was able to establish a small research group in organic chemistry, housed in temporary laboratories of an industrial research institute.","During our stay in London for the first time I was able to establish personal contact with some of the organic chemists, whose work I knew and admired from the literature. I found them most gracious and helpful.","In the summer of 1965 I was invited to join Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio and returned to academic life as professor with the added responsibility of becoming also Department Chairman.","It was in 1969 that I was able to give up my administrative responsibility. As I worked hard my research never suffered during this period and as a matter of fact these were probably some of my most productive years."],"George Armstrong Custer":["I would be willing, yes glad, to see a battle every day during my life.","You ask me if I will not be glad when the last battle is fought, so far as the country is concerned I, of course, must wish for peace, and will be glad when the war is ended, but if I answer for myself alone, I must say that I shall regret to see the war end.","I appeal to you as a soldier to spare me the humiliation of seeing my regiment march to meet the enemy and I not share its dangers.","There are not enough Indians in the world to defeat the Seventh Cavalry.","My purpose is to make my narrative as truthful as possible.","Benteen, come on, big village, be quick. Bring packs."],"George Ayittey":["Dictators are allergic to reform, and they are cunning survivors. They will do whatever it takes to preserve their power and wealth, no matter how much blood ends up on their hands. They are master deceivers and talented manipulators who cannot be trusted to change.","African history is filled with experiences of people shooting their way to power and then splintering into factions, like in Somalia and Liberia.","Dictators cause the world's worst problems: all the collapsed states, and all the devastated economies. All the vapid cases of corruption, grand theft, and naked plunder of the treasury are caused by dictators, leaving in their wake trails of wanton destruction, horrendous carnage and human debris.","Getting rid of the dictator is only a first step in establishing a free society. The dictatorship must also be disassembled.","Personally, I regard myself as an intellectual 'rebel,' kicking against the 'old colonialism-imperialism paradigm' which has landed Africa in a conundrum.","Africa's salvation doesn't lie in begging and begging for more aid, and as an African, I find it very, very humiliating.","What you and I understand as a government doesn't exist in many African countries. In fact, what we call our governments are vampire states. Vampires because they suck the economic vitality out of their people. Government is the problem in Africa.","Hippos kill more people in Africa annually than any other wild animal.","Mugabe's become a disgrace to Africa. And I must say this because I am an African and a lot of us looked up to him back in the 1980s when he was the liberation hero. But he's now turned himself into a murderous despot.","The reason why Botswana has done very well is because it's the only black African country which went back to its roots and built upon its own indigenous institutions.","There was free trade in Africa. There was free enterprise in Africa before the colonialists came.","Across Africa there is what I call a colonialist mentality or orthodoxy. Orthodoxy in the sense that a lot of things have gone wrong in Africa in the post-colonial period. And time and time again, any time something went wrong, the leadership claims that it was never their fault.","Look at the history of peace accords in Africa. They have a terrible record. They are shredded even before the ink on them is dry.","If NATO goes in and solves the crisis in Darfur, when the next one comes along Africa's leaders will just sit back.","In a banana republic, one might slip on a banana peel but things do work - now and then for the people, albeit inefficiently and unreliably.","The richest persons in Africa are heads of state, governors and ministers. So every 'educated' African who wants to be rich - and there is nothing wrong with wanting to be rich - heads straight into government or politics.","Africa has more dictators per capita than any other continent.","The solutions to Africa's problems lie in Africa, not in Live Aid concerts.","There's a belief that since Africa got a raw deal from the colonial West, then the Chinese must be Africa's best friend. But the evidence doesn't show that, and the main criticism is that they are building infrastructure in exchange for Africa's resources in deals that are structured to favor China.","What Africa needs to do is to grow, to grow out of debt.","When Uganda got debt relief in 1999, the first item President Museveni bought was a presidential jacket for himself.","Radio is the death and life of Africa.","The 'Cheetah Generation' refers to the new and angry generation of young African graduates and professionals, who look at African issues and problems from a totally different and unique perspective.","Unlike their Western counterparts, Africans take elections very seriously - rising up early to queue patiently in line for hours under the hot sun and cast their ballots. Any misguided attempt to nullify or steal their votes will evoke a strong reaction from them.","Western-style multi-party democracy is possible but not suitable for Africa.","Just because a group does not take its decisions by voting does not mean they have no understanding of the essence of democracy.","Virtually all of Africa's civil wars were started by politically marginalized or excluded groups.","In the West, the basic economic and social unit is the individual; in Africa, it is the extended family or the collective.","Traditionally, Africans hate governments. They hate tyranny.","The election of Senator Barack Obama brought jubilation across Africa, where millions celebrated him as 'one of their own.'"],"George B. McClellan":["The Union, which can alone insure internal peace, and external security to each State, Must and Shall be Preserved, cost what it may in time, treasure, and blood.","The moment for action has arrived, and I know that I can trust in you to save our country.","Conscious of my own weakness, I can only seek fervently the guidance of the Ruler of the Universe, and, relying on His all-powerful aid, do my best to restore Union and peace to a suffering people, and to establish and guard their liberties and rights.","When this sad war is over we will all return to our homes, and feel that we can ask no higher honor than the proud consciousness that we belonged to the Army of the Potomac.","As far as military necessity will permit, religiously respect the constitutional rights of all.","All quiet along the Potomac."],"George Balanchine":["The ballet is a purely female thing; it is a woman, a garden of beautiful flowers, and man is the gardener.","In my ballets, woman is first. Men are consorts. God made men to sing the praises of women. They are not equal to men: They are better.","One is born to be a great dancer.","Most ballet teachers in the United States are terrible. If they were in medicine, everyone would be poisoned.","In ballet a complicated story is impossible to tell... we can't dance synonyms.","God creates, I do not create. I assemble and I steal everywhere to do it - from what I see, from what the dancers can do, from what others do."],"George Ball":["Nostalgia is a seductive liar.","Not only must Americans admire Israel, there can be no doubt that we have an interest in, and special responsibility for, that valiant nation.","Until 1956, America treated Israel not much differently from other friendly states.","Most Americans approach the problems of the Middle East with a pro-Israeli bias - and rightly so.","Yet the wonder of it all is that, while engaged in a seemingly endless struggle, the Israelis have managed to turn a desert into a garden.","The question is no longer whether the United States should contribute to assuring Israel's survival and prosperity; that goes without saying."],"George Bancroft":["In nine times out of ten, the slanderous tongue belongs to a disappointed person.","Where the people possess no authority, their rights obtain no respect.","The prejudices of ignorance are more easily removed than the prejudices of interest; the first are all blindly adopted, the second willfully preferred.","Conscience is the mirror of our souls, which represents the errors of our lives in their full shape.","Dishonesty is so grasping it would deceive God himself, were it possible.","Avarice is the vice of declining years.","By common consent gray hairs are a crown of glory; the only object of respect that can never excite envy.","The public is wiser than the wisest critic.","Beauty is but the sensible image of the Infinite. Like truth and justice it lives within us; like virtue and the moral law it is a companion of the soul.","The fears of one class of men are not the measure of the rights of another.","If reason is a universal faculty, the decision of the common mind is the nearest criterion of truth.","Truth is not exciting enough to those who depend on the characters and lives of their neighbors for all their amusement.","The best government rests on the people, and not on the few, on persons and not on property, on the free development of public opinion and not on authority.","The exact measure of the progress of civilization is the degree in which the intelligence of the common mind has prevailed over wealth and brute force."],"George Barr McCutcheon":["He was imposing, even in his pensiveness.","In course of time my first novel appeared. It was a love story.","It was a bright, clear afternoon in the late fall that pretty Miss Cable drove up in her trap and waited at the curb for her father to come forth from his office in one of Chicago's tallest buildings."],"George Benson":["Love songs are one of the great essences of life, the only thing that's lasting.","If you play music for the right reasons, the rest of the things will come. The right reason to play music is that you love it. That's why I play music. I never imagined that I was going to be doing this, especially because I never thought of myself as an instrumentalist.","One of the first things electric I ever saw was a guitar. I was living in a house with no electricity until, at 7, we moved to a house that had it. It had electric lights, but the previous owners had even taken the light bulbs with them when they moved.","I have been doing music all my life so everyday when I get up I expect music will be part of it.","I listen to other guitar players, yeah. It gives me new concepts and shows me where the instrument is going for the future and it is going some places. There are some musicians who are really putting out a good vibe with new theories. I try and keep up.","My biggest song in the world is 'Nothing's Gonna Change My Love for You.' All over the world, it's number one on the whole planet.","Life isn't all me. I have a family to support. I can't rob them of a good life simply because I want to play something.","I like to sing because my mother was a singer. She sang to me all the time, so I learned to love singing. I did have a career as little 10-year-old George Benson. I made my first record as a vocalist, but I've been playing guitar since I was 9.","We don't live in a jazz world, unfortunately. I think if I had lived in a jazz world, I would have done OK. I'm not sure I would have done great. I'm a lover of jazz music, so I would have been happy, don't get me wrong. I go to jazz concerts like the biggest jazz fan in world. The drag is that I don't play jazz for a living.","When I was 15 years old, my cousin and I formed a singing group called The Altaires. And, because we became the most popular singing group in the Tri-State area, the rest of the group convinced me I should play the guitar - even though I didn't own one! So what happened was, my stepfather actually made my first electric guitar for me for $23!","The greatest guitar player in the world today for me is Paco de Lucia, who is actually Spanish.","My whole career from the early 70s on has been mind-blowing. I didn't imagine in my life that I would ever be considered a guitar player first of all because I started off as a singer.","As my career has progressed, I've had the pleasure of playing with the baddest jazz cats on the planet. But that doesn't change my desire to entertain folks. That's really who I am.","Guitar gigs were everywhere in the '50s, and I started diddling around so I could keep working. Playing honky-tonk, simple stuff. I took a few gigs with an organ band that put me out front.","I like Simon Cowell - look at how many great artists have come out of the U.K. because of him.","Andres Segovia, the great name for guitar, he put classical guitar on the map. He was the proponent of it, the best in the world. So I was listening to a record that he had made, and a little bauble happened in the middle of the record. A finger slipped, and I said, 'Wait a minute. He's not allowed to make mistakes,' - my mind.","My stepfather met my mother when I was seven years old, and he was a guitar player. So he caught me messing with his guitar, his electric guitar, and he tried to show me some chords, but my hands were too small.","I study the Bible constantly. I teach the Bible. You know, I'm a Bible conductor, and I have a lot of people studies. But also, I see how small things really help people to get over humps in their life. Gives them direction.","I never gave up on that idea, you know, that jazz musicians have the same opportunity as everybody else and that it's what you put on that record that makes the difference whether you sell it or not or are able to get it into people's households.","My stepfather had an electric guitar. He went to his pawn store one day to get a guitar and an amp, and I couldn't understand what I was hearing. All afternoon, I just sat against the amp and let it reverberate through me. Something must have stuck.","I keep my ears open. The world can change overnight; that's what happens in this world. You never know. You have to keep your eyes and ears open. If you can't keep up, you ain't gonna catch up. I've been making records since 1953, and you just have to keep up.","I haven't done anything with Chick Corea. He had a group called Return to Forever, and everyone in the group became a superstar. I would really like to work with him.","My whole life, I've never worried about being No. 1, because that's the guy they've got to get out of there.","I've always hated rejection; I only want to go out there when I know I've got it right.","I moved to Hawaii from Inglewood, New Jersey. I had planned on retiring there.","I have seven boys.","One thing all the way through the show to me is boring. I don't care how great the artist is. I find that if my audience is very young, and they want to hear very young songs, my show will be dominated by that. But there'll be some ballads here and there and some swing tunes.","I think I'm more entertainer than musician. I like to get with the crowd, make this night special for them.","The jazz rhythm won't be understood by the bulk of my audience. That's the problem. We can get away with maybe one tune a night. It depends on where we place it. A song like 'Beyond the Sea,' the fans love that. It's fresh.","I don't particularly fall in love with my own compositions, but some of them are decent.","I actually got discovered in my hometown of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania by a man who worked at a place that sold barbecue sandwiches!","I've done two albums for Concord Records; one was with Al Jarreau and it did very well for us. The second album was called 'Songs And Stories,' and it had good songs and good performances, but I promised them I would do an album that was more jazz-oriented.","'I Want To Hold Your Hand' is a great classic by Paul McCartney and John Lennon, I sure love that song. I did like the classic version, a rock-oriented song, then someone heard me do it with the Grant Green approach - Grant Green and Larry Young did it, with a bossa nova beat on the funky side."],"George Bentham":["I first began to dry specimens for preservation carelessly perhaps at first, but before the season was over, I had collected between one and two hundred species.","I decided that my means were sufficient to enable me to devote myself to botany, a determination which I never, during the long period of my subsequent career, had on any occasion any reason to repent of."],"George Berkeley":["That neither our thoughts, nor passions, nor ideas formed by the imagination, exist without the mind, is what every body will allow.","I had rather be an oyster than a man, the most stupid and senseless of animals.","Others indeed may talk, and write, and fight about liberty, and make an outward pretence to it; but the free-thinker alone is truly free.","All the choir of heaven and furniture of earth - in a word, all those bodies which compose the frame of the world - have not any subsistence without a mind.","We have first raised a dust and then complain we cannot see.","Many things, for aught I know, may exist, whereof neither I nor any other man hath or can have any idea or notion whatsoever.","He who says there is no such thing as an honest man, you may be sure is himself a knave.","Truth is the cry of all, but the game of few.","A mind at liberty to reflect on its own observations, if it produce nothing useful to the world, seldom fails of entertainment to itself.","So long as I confine my thoughts to my own ideas divested of words, I do not see how I can be easily mistaken.","If we admit a thing so extraordinary as the creation of this world, it should seem that we admit something strange, and odd, and new to human apprehension, beyond any other miracle whatsoever.","The eye by long use comes to see even in the darkest cavern: and there is no subject so obscure but we may discern some glimpse of truth by long poring on it.","That thing of hell and eternal punishment is the most absurd, as well as the most disagreeable thought that ever entered into the head of mortal man.","From my own being, and from the dependency I find in myself and my ideas, I do, by an act of reason, necessarily infer the existence of a God, and of all created things in the mind of God.","The same principles which at first view lead to skepticism, pursued to a certain point, bring men back to common sense."],"George Bernard Shaw":["Progress is impossible without change, and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything.","You use a glass mirror to see your face; you use works of art to see your soul.","The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place.","We are made wise not by the recollection of our past, but by the responsibility for our future.","Success does not consist in never making mistakes but in never making the same one a second time.","Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.","There is no sincerer love than the love of food.","Silence is the most perfect expression of scorn.","Beware of false knowledge; it is more dangerous than ignorance.","Democracy substitutes election by the incompetent many for appointment by the corrupt few.","I learned long ago, never to wrestle with a pig.

This may not be happiness, but it is greatness.","It is the mark of a truly intelligent person to be moved by statistics.","Do not do unto others as you expect they should do unto you. Their tastes may not be the same.","A life spent making mistakes is not only more honorable, but more useful than a life spent doing nothing.","I have to live for others and not for myself: that's middle-class morality.","The golden rule is that there are no golden rules.","Patriotism is your conviction that this country is superior to all others because you were born in it.","Youth is a wonderful thing.

In capitalism, private property is cardinal, and distribution left to ensue from the play of free contract and selfish interest on that basis, no matter what anomalies it may present.","A fool's brain digests philosophy into folly, science into superstition, and art into pedantry. Hence University education.","I want to be thoroughly used up when I die, for the harder I work the more I live.

'A miracle a minute' would not be a bad slogan for God.","If a woman can, by careful selection of a father and nourishment of herself, produce a citizen with efficient senses, sound organs and a good digestion, she should clearly be secured a sufficient reward for that natural service to make her willing to undertake and repeat it.","Why should we take advice on sex from the pope?

So I did ten times more work.","All great truths begin as blasphemies.","It is a curious sensation: the sort of pain that goes mercifully beyond our powers of feeling. When your heart is broken, your boats are burned: nothing matters any more. It is the end of happiness and the beginning of peace.","The man with a toothache thinks everyone happy whose teeth are sound. The poverty-stricken man makes the same mistake about the rich man.","If there was nothing wrong in the world there wouldn't be anything for us to do.","No question is so difficult to answer as that to which the answer is obvious.","I often quote myself.

That always feels at first as if you had lost something.","Life would be tolerable but for its amusements.","We must always think about things, and we must think about things as they are, not as they are said to be.","Caesar was a man of great common sense and good taste, meaning thereby a man without originality or moral courage.","There is no satisfaction in hanging a man who does not object to it.","You can always tell an old soldier by the inside of his holsters and cartridge boxes. The young ones carry pistols and cartridges; the old ones, grub.","Virtue consists, not in abstaining from vice, but in not desiring it.","A man who has no office to go, to I don't care who he is, is a trial of which you can have no conception.","Self-sacrifice enables us to sacrifice other people without blushing.","Few people think more than two or three times a year; I have made an international reputation for myself by thinking once or twice a week.","A statesman who confines himself to popular legislation - or, for the matter of that, a playwright who confines himself to popular plays - is like a blind man's dog who goes wherever the blind man pulls him, on the ground that both of them want to go to the same place.","Nothing is worth doing unless the consequences may be serious.","There is only one religion, though there are a hundred versions of it.","She had lost the art of conversation but not, unfortunately, the power of speech.","We should all be obliged to appear before a board every five years and justify our existence... on pain of liquidation."],"George Best":["I spent a lot of money on booze, birds and fast cars. The rest I just squandered.","I became a beach bum.","Love is about mutual respect, apart from attraction.","Maybe 'loner' is too strong a word, but I've always enjoyed being on my own.","The best thing about being a dad? Well, I think it's just the thing that every man wants - to have a son and heir.","The nice thing is that when people come up to me, it's the football they remember, not all the other rubbish.","Drink is the only opponent I have been unable to beat.","In 1969, I gave up women and alcohol - it was the worst 20 minutes of my life.","There are good players, there are great players, and there are those few at the pinnacle - the Peles, Cruyffs and Maradonas.","If you make up your own mind, you can only blame yourself.","I was born with a great gift, and sometimes with that comes a destructive streak.","I definitely don't think that money can buy you love. It can buy you affection but certainly not love.","The people of Northern Ireland have sorted out my whole life.","I have always thought I was the best ever player.","As long as I stay in training and play well, I don't see what objection there can be to what I do off the field.","I've always been a bit of a gypsy.","My long hair and the sideburns made me stand out, really, because my hairstyle was completely different to the other footballers of that era.","I always wanted more - more of everything.","I noticed that when I touched the ball on the field, you could hear this shrill noise in the crowd with all the birds screaming like at a Beatles concert.","I was probably the first footballer ever to have a pop-star profile, and my agent was right when he said we could put my name on stair rods and sell them to people in bungalows.","If I'd been born ugly, you'd never have heard of Pele.","Nobody knows me.","I'd have to be superman to do some of the things I'm supposed to have done, I've been at six different places at six different times.","I used to go missing a lot... Miss Canada, Miss United Kingdom, Miss World.","I've stopped drinking, but only while I'm asleep.","That thing about being an icon, the fifth Beatle, I just found it so freaky.","I even found it difficult to watch myself playing on TV because I couldn't identify with the person on the screen. I couldn't get to grips with it. It was as if it was all happening to someone else.","Football is a sad game.","People say you have to hit rock bottom, and, I can tell you, almost dying is as rock bottom as it gets.","I was ill, and everyone could see it but me.","You can't trust very many people.","I can remember earning £5,000 a game playing for Hibs at the end of the Seventies. They let me commute from London, train on the Friday and play on Saturday. That lasted until my friends at the Inland Revenue decided to take two-thirds. That wasn't very entertaining for me.","There isn't a single player I would pay to watch. You can say Thierry Henry, he's a fabulous striker, with pace and power, but a great entertainer needs to have charisma, too. Does he have charisma? No.","I was the one who took football off the back pages and put it on to page one.","I was 19 or 20 when The Beatles were at their peak, and I was coming up to the peak of my career, too. I was also the first footballer to have long hair, and that's how I got my nickname 'the Fifth Beatle.'","David Beckham has never impressed me.","We were the first generation to have to deal with the modern stardom of football. Some handled it better than others.","It all went wrong with football, the thing I loved most of all, and from there, my life slowly fell apart.","I'm lucky that, despite all the bad press I've had over the years, the public still seems to like me.","I don't have any regrets. I made all my own decisions.","When I look back on my life as a whole, it is impossible for me not to feel blessed.","Dave Mackay is my definition of a superstar. The man broke his leg three times, but wouldn't be carried off. He walked off.","I rate Fabien Barthez and played with two great keepers in Alex Stepney and Harry Gregg.","When I was playing, there were always lots of teams in contention for the league - Arsenal, Manchester City, Liverpool, Leeds. Every week was a big game and a big battle.","Players today moan about the number of games, but when you're young, you can't play enough.","There are so many memories for me in Manchester. Everywhere I go, I think, 'I used to have boutiques here, clubs there, restaurants in that area.'","It's a big compliment that so many people want to see me. For them, it's all about football. That's what they remember about me.","Football is big business - you can't get away from it. But you have to separate that side from the playing.","I used to rush home to see 'Match Of The Day.' Whatever I was doing, I wouldn't miss it.","At the start of the season, there are 16 teams in the top division looking behind them, making sure they avoid relegation. The fear starts in the boardroom, comes down to managers and through to players. The fans sense it.","From the FA to UEFA and FIFA, there's a naivety, a lack of knowledge and understanding and packed with people who are out of touch.","The onus is on the managers to send out an attacking formation and to tell their players to be bold.","I used to dream about taking the ball 'round the keeper, stopping it on the line, and then getting on my hands and knees and heading it into the net. When I scored against Benfica in the 1968 European Cup final, I nearly did it. I left the keeper for dead, but then I chickened out.","My one big regret is that I didn't play on for ten more years.","Players now have a groin injury for months and months, and I often think they don't really give a toss whether they're playing or not because they're getting paid anyway.","Just as I wanted to outdo everyone when I played, I had to outdo everyone when we were out on the town.","I got my buzz from playing.","They'll forget all the rubbish when I've gone, and they'll remember the football. If only one person thinks I'm the best player in the world, that's good enough for me.","One reason I don't want to play in England again is because we don't have any personalities.","In England, when an athlete gets to the top, we do our best to destroy him.","I have really been disillusioned with soccer in England.","I dressed more like a pop star, I suppose, rather than the traditional blazer and tall trousers other players went for."],"George Blagden":["The best characters to play are the ones who have deep internal conflict.","The Vikings colonized Britain, and a lot of our modern day towns are named after Viking names that settled these big towns."],"George Boole":["Probability is expectation founded upon partial knowledge. A perfect acquaintance with all the circumstances affecting the occurrence of an event would change expectation into certainty, and leave nether room nor demand for a theory of probabilities.","No matter how correct a mathematical theorem may appear to be, one ought never to be satisfied that there was not something imperfect about it until it also gives the impression of being beautiful.","Of the many forms of false culture, a premature converse with abstractions is perhaps the most likely to prove fatal to the growth of a masculine vigour of intellect.","It is not of the essence of mathematics to be conversant with the ideas of number and quantity.","To unfold the secret laws and relations of those high faculties of thought by which all beyond the merely perceptive knowledge of the world and of ourselves is attained or matured, is a object which does not stand in need of commendation to a rational mind."],"George Borrow":["It has been said that idleness is the parent of mischief, which is very true; but mischief itself is merely an attempt to escape from the dreary vacuum of idleness.","A losing trade, I assure you, sir: literature is a drug.","Next to the love of God, the love of country is the best preventive of crime.","I am invariably of the politics of the people at whose table I sit, or beneath whose roof I sleep.","Youth will be served, every dog has his day, and mine has been a fine one.","There are no countries in the world less known by the British than those selfsame British Islands.","Two great talkers will not travel far together.","Translation is at best an echo.","Life is very sweet, brother; who would wish to die?"],"George Brauchler":["I believe in the rule of law, and I respect the will of Colorado voters.","I'm happy every time I stand up in court and say, 'George Brauchler for the people of Colorado...' I take no shame in that; I take pride in that. My mom took pride in being an attorney, too.","In the military, the bottom line has to be the success of the mission.","I want to focus on crimes that affect families and not get distracted going for high-publicity cases. I want to see us move away from politics and focus more on prosecution.","I'm a firm believer that if you are not on the team, you ought not have input on who the quarterback is going to be.","The best government is not the one that you can serve in the longest, but the government that's closest to the people.","I never thought I was going to get involved in politics other than the DA's office.","I don't think I'm the cookie-cutter candidate.","Transportation and education are two big ones for me. And transportation is selfishly a big issue for me because I drive these roads every day. My family does.","I'm not the candidate who puts his kids in private schools.","Let's diminish the impact and influence D.C. has on the decisions that we make here in Colorado.","I am not someone who is different from Colorado. I am part of Colorado. I am like my neighbors and my community.","Honestly, the America of my childhood I'm not convinced is available anymore to my own children, and that is a significant motivation to want to go out and do something better for them and rest of my neighbors in Colorado.","I didn't grow up thinking to myself, 'Someday, if I play all my cards right, I can end up in a public institution with a lower approval rating than attorneys.'","I don't ever go into anything thinking I'm going to lose. I go into it thinking and believing I'm going to come out on top. I'm going to succeed."],"George Brett":["If a tie is like kissing your sister, losing is like kissing you grandmother with her teeth out.","I never lifted a weight in my life. Why am I going to do steroids? That's not going to do me any good. We didn't have any weights in our clubhouse. We had one exercise bike and that was for the guy who tweaked his hamstring. And that thing didn't even work half the time.","I am not too serious about anything. I believe you have to enjoy yourself to get the most out of your ability. I can take the criticism with the accolades. Neither affects me.","There's nothing like Opening Day. There's nothing like the start of a new season. I started playing baseball when I was seven years old and quit playing when I was 40, so it's kind of in my blood.","I'm a ballplayer. I know how hard the game is... and anybody that makes it in the Hall of Fame, I support. They become a member of our special fraternity.","Every time I sit with our general manager at a baseball game, and there's number-cruncher and statistician guy - I'm sitting around - they start talking about stuff, and I say, 'What's that? I've never heard of that one before.'","American League teams don't bunt very often. National League teams bunt a lot.","Old third basemen become first basemen, and old first basemen become designated hitters.","A woman will be elected President before Wade Boggs is called out on strikes. I guarantee that.","I could have played another year, but I would have been playing for the money, and baseball deserves better than that.","If I stay healthy, I have a chance to collect 3,000 hits and 1,000 errors.","I've only read two books in my life: Baseball Sparkplug and Love Story.","If there was no intentional walks, the guy would just walk him anyway, unintentionally intentionally walk him. You see a lot more of that than what meets the eye.","If I was going to make one rule change, I would bring the DH in the National League.","Not many people get to the major leagues and succeed right away. There are some struggles. Everyone seems to struggle.","Do I want someone to get more hits than me? No. Do I want someone to hit more home runs than me? No. Do I want someone to have more RBI than me? No. I get a kick out of seeing the all-time leaders and my name's on top of every one, with the exception of strikeouts. I get a kick out of that.","My father cared a lot about me, but he never gave me the satisfaction of really knowing it. Hitting .390 wasn't enough for him. Nothing seemed to be. He was not trying to be mean. He was just seeing to it that I never got self-satisfied, that I worked hard to get the most out of what I had."],"George Burns":["Happiness is having a large, loving, caring, close-knit family in another city.","You can't help getting older, but you don't have to get old.","I'd rather be a failure at something I love than a success at something I hate.","It takes only one drink to get me drunk. The trouble is, I can't remember if it's the thirteenth or the fourteenth.","At my age flowers scare me.","If you live to be one hundred, you've got it made. Very few people die past that age.","First you forget names, then you forget faces. Next you forget to pull your zipper up and finally, you forget to pull it down.","I can remember when the air was clean and sex was dirty.","Too bad that all the people who know how to run the country are busy driving taxicabs and cutting hair.","If you ask what is the single most important key to longevity, I would have to say it is avoiding worry, stress and tension. And if you didn't ask me, I'd still have to say it.","When I was a boy the Dead Sea was only sick.","I look to the future because that's where I'm going to spend the rest of my life.","You know you're getting old when you stoop to tie your shoelaces and wonder what else you could do while you're down there.","Everything that goes up must come down.

Besides, I can't die now - I'm booked.","I spent a year in that town, one Sunday.","Don't stay in bed, unless you can make money in bed.","Retirement at sixty-five is ridiculous. When I was sixty-five I still had pimples.","The most important thing in acting is honesty. If you can fake that, you've got it made.","Too bad all the people who know how to run this country are busy running taxicabs or cutting hair.","The secret of a good sermon is to have a good beginning and a good ending, then having the two as close together as possible.","Sex at age 90 is like trying to shoot pool with a rope.","You've got to be honest; if you can fake that, you've got it made.","I honestly think it is better to be a failure at something you love than to be a success at something you hate.","I smoke ten to fifteen cigars a day. At my age I have to hold on to something.","Nice to be here? At my age it's nice to be anywhere.","I can't afford to die; I'd lose too much money.","Happiness? A good cigar, a good meal, a good cigar and a good woman - or a bad woman; it depends on how much happiness you can handle.","I'm very pleased to be here. Let's face it, at my age I'm very pleased to be anywhere.","This is the sixth book I've written, which isn't bad for a guy who's only read two.","I'm at the age now where just putting my cigar in its holder is a thrill.","Be quick to learn and wise to know.","It's hard for me to get used to these changing times.

I figure if I give them exact change, they should take me exactly where I want to go.","I've seen many politicians paralyzed in the legs as myself, but I've seen more of them who were paralyzed in the head.","They're building a bridge over the Potomac for all the white liberals fleeing to Virginia."],"George C. Williams":["The general rule is that anything that is passed on in reproduction does not undergo senescence.","Darwin based his theory on generalizations that were strictly empirical. You can go out and see that organisms do vary, that variations are inherited, and that every organism is capable of increasing its numbers in sufficiently favorable circumstances.","The only realistic view is that a human life arises gradually, which is not much help in making personal decisions or devising public policy.","The moment-of-conception fallacy implies that fertilization is a simple process with never a doubt as to whether it has or has not happened.","Job's avoidance of rebellion against God has nothing to do with God being good or wise or anything like that; it's strictly because God is so powerful, and you don't fight something when you are so much weaker than that which you would fight.","I am convinced that it is the light and the way.","I think that my main criticism in that book was directed at the general assumption that adaptation characterizes populations and species, rather than simply the individuals in the populations and species.","Ever since then, all descendant vertebrates have had the forward end of the digestive system and the forward end of the respiratory system very much involved with each other.

I've got many homosexual friends, the issue is not in any way a homophobic reaction on my part.","What I think is that we in the church - and especially I as an Archbishop - I'm responsible for maintaining our rules, and making sure we hold to unity in the Body of Christ.","We've got to trust the politicians with these decisions.","We've got to find ways of confronting the issues that divide - and at the heart of cultural issues, you often find religions.","We must get back to a very strong Christianity... Christianity shaped America and England, and we need to get back to those moral foundations that made us great.","The Israelis have suffered a great deal, we must condemn suicide bombers, and we must never say that the plight of the Palestinians justifies this terrible thing.","One I've been passionately committed to, of course, is women's ministry; I believe solidly in it as a Gospel issue and we've found our way through that.","In my time as Archbishop of Canterbury I've seen a growing sense of unity and mission.","If there are Muslims who believe that they've got to kill Christians to make a way for the Islamic faith in the West, not only would they be disappointed, but it will lead to conflict, there's no doubt about that.","I'm on record as being understood to be a supporter of a reformed establishment, in which other Christian denominations, and other faiths, play a major part.","I think what has happened, actually, is that September 11 has given a spur, a renewed urgency, to dialogue between the great faiths.","I think what Calvinism may offer us is that God's in charge of his world.","I think in my own country, at the way we've seen through the ordination of women to the priesthood, which I'm delighted about, and that will move on to another level before very long.","I mean, I can look back with great pleasure on what has happened in Sudan, and our commitment to people who are persecuted in that kind of way.","I believe with all my heart that the Church of Jesus Christ should be a Church of blurred edges.","God loves us all, wants us all to share his kingdom, has a role for us all.","From a Christian point of view of course we do want a peaceful world, and I think September 11 did actually make people aware not only of vulnerability and how transitory life is, but there are forces of good and honor and justice which speak to us of God and his love for us.","But, as you have intimated, I am among those who would be very wary of any military action in the light of Saddam Hussein's willingness to allow the weapons inspectors to go in.","And so in my warnings, I was pointing to a number of incidents around the communion that could undermine our growing sense of communion - of becoming a global communion. So that's why I pointed to New Westminster in Canada, to incidents in the United States, and Sydney itself.","And here at our Anglican Consultative Council, we have many reports of growth and great encouragement.","An office boy in London was the lowest of the low.

Some people dream of things that never were and ask, Why not? Some people have to go to work and don't have time for all that.","Frisbeetarianism is the belief that when you die, your soul goes up on the roof and gets stuck.","Atheism is a non-prophet organization.","The very existence of flame-throwers proves that some time, somewhere, someone said to themselves, You know, I want to set those people over there on fire, but I'm just not close enough to get the job done.","I went to a bookstore and asked the saleswoman, 'Where's the self-help section?'

There's a closeness that has continued.","If you buy a lottery ticket, you really don't expect to win. However, if you do win, it's a different story. The same is true about getting an Oscar. Of course I knew I was nominated, but I never expected my name to be called. When it was, I'm still at a loss to describe the feelings that I experienced.","I don't regret 'West Side Story' one bit. It was an incredible movie full of young people with amazing rapport.","Why do Greeks always open restaurants that fail?","A lot of people know that I danced, but I also sang.","I had a recording contract with Capitol Records. I loved recording and being in that studio. I made four albums.","As far as dancing was concerned, I always wanted to do it. To actually be performing was thrilling for me.","One of my favorite credits is to say that I worked behind Marilyn Monroe, and I love saying that. She was phenomenal.","To be honest, I think I have a nice voice. A good voice... and I loved recording.","I can go into any working circumstance and, simply, I'm prepared to deal with the work. It was a long, hard lesson I learned.","I made movies with some very nice people, experienced actors.","I don't believe I was jinxed or hexed by winning an Academy Award in my first picture, 'West Side Story.'"],"George Chapman":["Be free all worthy spirits, and stretch yourselves, for greatness and for height.","Pure innovation is more gross than error.","They're only truly great who are truly good.","An Englishman, being flattered, is a lamb; threatened, a lion.","Flatterers look like friends, as wolves like dogs.","Advice is seldom welcome; and those who want it the most always like it the least.","Young men think old men are fools; but old men know young men are fools.","Promise is most given when the least is said.","And let a scholar all earth's volumes carry, he will be but a walking dictionary: a mere articulate clock.","Extremes, though contrary, have the like effects. Extreme heat kills, and so extreme cold: extreme love breeds satiety, and so extreme hatred; and too violent rigor tempts chastity, as does too much license.","Let no man under value the price of a virtuous woman's counsel.","He that shuns trifles must shun the world.","Ignorance is the mother of admiration.","I am ashamed the law is such an ass.","We inherit nothing truly, but what our actions make us worthy of.","Who to himself is law, no law doth need, offends no law, and is a king indeed.","For one heat, all know, doth drive out another, One passion doth expel another still."],"George Clinton":["Style is whatever you want to do, if you can do it with confidence.","When I hear music that parents hate, or older musicians hate, I know that's the new music. When I hear older people saying, 'I hate Rap or Techno' I rush to it.","I was at the Apollo Theater all the time, skipping school, and I worked in a barbershop. That's how I started with doo-wop. Now I've come full circle. I did all kinds of music. I used to work on Broadway and Tin Pan Alley.","I'm always surprised that I'm still around funk and that people are still into it.","You can rebel against everything adults say. When I want to find out what the new music is, I find out what parents hate.","Record companies would rather you stay dumb, not even think of it as a business, so they can either rip you off or get you out of the way in five years to make way for the new groups.","I pick up on styles, way before they get popular, pretty much before young kids do. I see 'em coming.","Hip-hop is getting to the point now where they are going to start sounding like Al Jarreau or Bobby McFerrin or some of the other poets. Some of the better rappers can rap real fast without even melodies. It'll get to that same point.","I think a lot of people really have religious overtones of having come from somewhere. I mean, even the whole concept of religion is kind of alien.","The words I use too often are X-rated, something an old man like me shouldn't be talking about anyway."],"George Clooney":["I enjoy going on motorcycle trips and stopping in small towns and enjoying drinks with the locals.","In doing the screenplay for 'Good Night, and Good Luck,' the most important thing for me was to constantly go back to wherever the opposition would argue. So I had to keep reading all the books and articles about why McCarthy is such a good guy.","If people see me having dinner with a beautiful woman, they immediately believe that I'm having a love affair with her. Of course that's rubbish. I'm not a playboy!","I don't tweet, I don't go on Facebook. I think there's too much information about all of us out there. I'm liking the idea of privacy more and more.","But I'm kind of comfortable with getting older because it's better than the other option, which is being dead. So I'll take getting older.","My father was and is a great journalist. Thirty years ago, I was studying broadcasting in college, and the problem was I wasn't nearly as good as my father. I wasn't as quick or as smart as my old man, and I realized it would be a long time before I was ever going to be, and I decided to do something else.","I believe in all the qualities of being a liberal. I keep going back to all the great social events in our country's history, starting with the Salem witch trials, where the conservative view was that they're witches and should be burned at the stake, and the liberal view was there's no such thing as witches.","I'm kind of comfortable with getting older because it's better than the other option, which is being dead. So I'll take getting older.","The simple truth is that everyone has an opinion, everyone has the right to voice it, and they should if they want to.","I bought a piano once because I had the dream of playing As Time Goes By as some girl's leaning on it drinking a martini. Great image. But none of it worked out. I can't even play Chopsticks. But I've got a nice piano at my house!","I love my grey hair and wrinkles. I love the fact that my face has more of an edge and more character than it did when I was in my twenties and thirties. No Botox for me.","The loneliest you will get is in the most public of arenas: You will go to a place and end up in the smallest compartment possible, because it's a distraction to everybody, and you end up not getting to enjoy it like everyone else.","I find that as you get older, you start to simplify things in general.","In the '60s, when I was growing up, one of the great elements of American culture was the protest song. There were songs about the civil rights movement, the women's rights movement, the antiwar movement. It wasn't just Bob Dylan, it was everybody at the time.","Failures are infinitely more instructive than successes.","You can't legislate good taste.","The only failure is not to try.","I had to stop going to auditions thinking, 'Oh, I hope they like me.' I had to go in thinking I was the answer to their problem.","You don't want to try to look younger, because you'll look wrong. You dye your hair, you look wrong. You wear a bad toupee, you look wrong. You wear makeup to hide things, you get your eyes done, you look wrong.","People know everything about everybody now.","It's possible for me to make a bad movie out of a good script, but I can't make a good movie from a bad script.","I watch 'Batman & Robin' from time to time. It's the worst movie I ever made, so it's a good lesson in humility.","I'm the flavor of the month.","You have only a short period of time in your life to make your mark, and I'm there now.","After doing One Fine Day and playing a pediatrician on ER, I'll never have kids. I'm going to have a vasectomy.","For me, the definition of a patriot is someone who is willing to constantly question the government; that's what separates us from other countries.","Hosting is work. It means you don't get to go up to your room and disappear and take a nap. Like everybody else does after lunch. I'm talking about hosting, not hosting a dinner party, but hosting people staying in your home.","I do happen to have a good life... But I also like to work. I feel like I got the brass ring and I got very lucky in this.","We're picking on people we can beat.","I don't like to share my personal life... it wouldn't be personal if I shared it.","I was in a bar and I said to a friend, 'You know, we've become those 40-year-old guys we used to look at and say, 'Isn't it sad?'","The idea that every time you do a film you're supposed to be tortured confuses me. I mean, guys who say, 'Oh, it's really tough, my character is really suffering' -come on. For us, even in the rotten ones we've had a good time. I don't think you have to suffer.","The hardest thing is trying not to correct everything on the Internet. It'd be night and day - wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. So you just have to say, 'All right, I'll take it, bring it on.'","I love children and I get along with them great. It's just that I believe if you're going to be a parent, there has to be something inside you that says, 'I want a family.' I don't feel that sense of urgency.","You never really learn much from hearing yourself talk.","Hollywood still makes things. We still export a couple billion dollars' worth of product overseas. Original, new product. Some people might not agree that it's original or new, but basically it is.","I had my Aunt Rosie, who was famous and then not, so I got a lesson in fame early on. And I understood how little it has to do with you. And also how you could use it.","I go on YouTube when somebody says to look something up.","'Ides of March' I did for scale - scale as a director, scale as an actor, scale as a writer.","My life isn't focused on results. My life is really focused on the process of doing all the things I'm doing, from work to relationships to friendships to charitable work.","It's not that I lead this oblivious life where I think I've got such a great personality that people want to spend time with me. If someone has a poster of you or asks for your autograph, clearly you can't take them out on a date. It's not that interesting if someone is just interested in you.","I'm so lucky to have been raised the way I have, because my parents believed that everyone had the right to their own feelings, opinions, and existence; as long as they weren't harming others, you had to defend those rights.","I think you should automatically donate your organs because that would turn the balance of organ donation in a huge way. I would donate whatever anybody would take, and I'd probably do the cremation bit.","Anytime there's an actual grassroots movement that isn't funded by people trying to create a grassroots movement, I find that interesting.","I'm certainly the last person to give advice on, well, anything.","My grandparents back in Kentucky owned a tobacco farm. So, to make money in the summer, we could cut and chop and top and house and strip the tobacco.","Run for office? No. I've slept with too many women, I've done too many drugs, and I've been to too many parties.","They say I was a bad Batman, that it was my fault, that I buried the franchise. But the truth is, it was a big project. I was pretty intimidated in that world. I did the best I could in the situation I was given.","You make a lot of films, do you? You make a lot of films yourself? Yeah, I'd like to see you make a film first before you get to talk about it. What a jerk.","America can't beat anyone anymore.","The government itself is running exactly like the Sopranos and they sit back and they make deals. And they say okay, 'I'm going do this: France, you're getting the pipelines.'","I'm not smart enough and I don't know enough about what's going on.","I don't care. Charlton Heston is the head of the National Rifle Association. He deserves whatever anyone says about him.","There's no connection between al-Qaeda and Iraq.","I don't believe in happy endings, but I do believe in happy travels, because ultimately, you die at a very young age, or you live long enough to watch your friends die. It's a mean thing, life.","I grew up in the world of bad television, on my dad's sets and then as a young schmuck on dating shows and so on.","I'd think, 'In a relationship, we should never have his kind of fight.' Then, instead of figuring out how to make it work, I looked for a way to get out of it. The truth is, you shouldn't be married if your that kind of person.","I'm really white trash.","When you're young you believe it when people tell you how good you are. And that's the danger, you inhale. Everyone will tell you you're a genius, which you are not, and if you understand that, you win.","I'm a Method actor. I spent years training for the drinking and carousing I had to do in this film.","Who would name their kid Jack with the last words 'off' at the end of the last name? No wonder that guy is screwed up.","The last real movie stars were probably Redford and Newman. And things were different then. There wasn't this amazing amount of magazines and information about them.","It's incredibly unfair. You don't see a lot of 60-year-old women with 20-year-old men onscreen.","I was watching 'Up In The Air' and I thought, 'Jesus, who's the old gray-haired guy?' And it was me. I never wear makeup for movies and now it's starting to show.","I've been lucky enough to do a few films that will last longer than an opening weekend and those films are the ones I'm proud of.","As you get older and ease your way into being a character actor you have to be comfortable with where you are in life and career, and I'm very comfortable with what I'm doing - working on projects I'm proud of.","The problem is, we elected a manager and we need a leader. Let's face it: Bush is just dim.","There is a strange pecking order among actors. Theatre actors look down on film actors, who look down on TV actors. Thank God for reality shows, or we wouldn't have anybody to look down on.","I just found out about 10 days ago that I must live 300 or 400 yards from Britney Spears... so now I have to move.","Directors are the captains of the ship, and it's your job as the lead actor to make sure that the rest of the cast understand that by doing whatever he says.","Directing is really exciting. In the end, it's more fun to be the painter than the paint.","I know what my limitations are as an actor, but my strength is putting myself into a well-written part. When I get in trouble is when I have to fix it, or when I have to carry it on personality.","I get asked a lot about getting into politics. I say, 'Take a look at politics. You tell me what seems appealing about that.'","You get better as an actor over time if you're growing. Like singers.","I have a real interest in pushing some of the limits of things that studios don't want to make.","I'm the old-fashioned type who prefers to meet a woman in a more normal setting. I don't like to feel that I'm being hunted down. I've always liked to do my own hunting when it comes to meeting women.","It's not about an opening weekend. It's about a career, building a set of films you're proud of. Period.","Most of the films I've done haven't done particularly well. I'm surprised I'm continuing to work.","An acting career usually has about a shelf life of ten years before people get sick of seeing you. It's a good thing to have a job to fall back on and I really do enjoy directing.","I'm only two years older than Brad Pitt, but I look a lot older, which used to greatly frustrate me. It doesn't anymore. I don't have to fit into that category and get trounced by Tom Cruise and Brad.","The first thing that I learned - and I understood it at a really young age - was that I could get a laugh. Really early. Because my mother and father are funny.","I probably wouldn't be a good spokesman for an electric car, because I'll still get on a private jet, and one flight on a private jet undoes all my electric-car good deeds.","If you're famous, I don't - for the life of me - I don't understand why any famous person would ever be on Twitter.","When you first start out, you are just happy to get a job, any job. And as time goes on, either you move forward or screech to a halt.","Without question, I wake every night five times.","Anyone would be lying if they said they didn't get lonely at times.","Yes, I slouch. My mother tells me that.","I'm not out trying to prove anything. I'm sort of finished with that, so I get to play in other sandboxes and try and figure out what I like and I'm interested in.","After a while, you just want transportation, and things like cool cars or motorcycles are all about getting attention. I get all the attention I could ever need, so I kind of like being in a minivan and people not paying so much attention to me.","My parents were disappointed I didn't finish college, and they were really upset when I went to Hollywood to become an actor. I was a big disappointment to them.","I had a Tesla. I was one of the first cats with a Tesla. But I'm telling you, I've been on the side of the road a while in that thing.","I don't know if winning at any cost is wrong or not. There are times I've thought that the end justified the means.","Directing is much more satisfying to me than acting.","The people I've respected most in the industry over the years - Paul Newman, for instance. I just loved the way he handled growing old on-screen. It's understanding that you're now basically a character actor. Which is fine, but you have to pay attention to it.","I don't go on that many dates, because the truth is, anytime you go out in public with a girl when you're well-known, there are pictures of you everywhere, and it's like you're a thing.","I've been my most happy and my most unhappy in relationships. I have family and friends and people I care very much about. I've got a really, really, really good life.","I think it's the most responsible thing you can do, to have kids. It's not something to be taken lightly. I don't have that gene that people have to replicate.","I think people in Italy live their lives better than we do. It's an older country, and they've learned to celebrate dinner and lunch, whereas we sort of eat as quickly as we can to get through it.","I've been working with Pat Robertson on Africa debt-relief, and we disagree on virtually everything except certain very specific, inalienable rights, and the truth is that morality and patriotism come in all shapes and sizes.","Over the years, over the history of our country, liberals have stood on many of the right sides of the issues.","You have to remember that in the microcosm of Cincinnati, Ohio, through northern Kentucky, my father was a big star, still is. So that made my sister and me really visible. Everybody knew us, talked about us.","I rarely tell anybody what they should be doing with their life.","I'm the least metrosexual cat you've ever met. I've never had my fingernails or toenails done, and I've cut my own hair longer than other people have cut my hair.","On an awards-show day, I can play basketball, go in, take a shower and put on a tux - it takes me three minutes to put on a tux - and be out the door in 15 minutes.","Growing old on screen is not for the faint of heart.","There's a certain cruelty to being on a big screen as your eyelids start to sag and your hair falls out and turns gray that you either have to be able to handle or not. What you can't do is try to force yourself into roles that you could have played or would have played ten years earlier.","I've walked with very famous people down red carpets over to the crowd of thousands of people, and you'll reach out to shake their hand and they've got a camera in their hand. And they don't even get their hand out, because they're recording the whole time.","I enjoy living in a nice house and having a nice life. So I do two or three commercials overseas a year to sort of fill in, because they pay pretty well.","I can't give you 150 takes. I can't even give you 30 different ways of doing it! I don't have the talent or the range for it.","Honestly, as you can imagine, it really isn't all that fun directing yourself, running back and forth to the monitors to see if you're terrible or not.","I just think there are a lot of celebrities who don't feel that they have a voice. A lot of actors come from a place of fear, and that's just a general statement about actors. You're terrified the casting director won't like you, you're terrified the producer won't like you, you're terrified the director won't like you, and on and on.","When you first start out as an actor, you're just looking for a good part. As time goes on, if you're being held responsible for the movies themselves, you're looking for a good script all around.","I've certainly done some turkeys along the way and made some dumb choices in my career, mostly early on. I'm one of the lucky ones who got to make a lot of mistakes very early when no one was paying attention.","I did a lot of terrible TV shows and was really terrible in them, and I've done terrible films I was terrible in, but nobody really noticed.","I've had some success at writing and directing, and I like it. It's infinitely more creative than just acting, and I have things I want to say and do.","My biggest fear is doing the same things 10 years from now. That would be a failure. It's something you have to constantly reassess, and asking yourself what you are going to do next makes it a good, long full journey.","Shutting down the government is not how you make government work.","I was very lucky to get well known much later in life. You need to have flopped quite a few times to get a sense of how little any of it has to do with you.","Fame can be very dangerous, because you can start to enjoy that part of it. And that's not the good part of what I do for a living. The good part is the making of films. The unpleasant part is the fame part, if you're not careful.","I certainly direct with confidence even if I'm not confident. I learned early on as an actor that confidence can be faked, and it's not always a terrible thing to do. A lot of times if people feel you're confident, then they're confident.","I think the reason why a lot of young people are such screw ups... is oftentimes they didn't have the luxury I had of forming important relationships and opinions and life experiences before having success.","It's very easy for people to be critical of President Obama's first term, but let's face it, he didn't exactly inherit the country in the best shape.","If I had been with all the women that I was said to have been with, I wouldn't have had the time to shoot a single movie!","My father ran for Congress in 2004, and I got a sense that there is no way to achieve much success without a certain amount of compromise.","On Christmas morning, before we could open our Christmas presents, we would go to this stranger's home and bring them presents. I remember helping clean the house up and putting up a tree. My father believed that you have a responsibility to look after everyone else.","Having 'Oscar winner' on your tombstone is a great thing.","I like owning dirt. You know, I spent a lot of time broke when I moved to California. So deep in my soul is still this idea of being unemployed. To me, owning land means you could sell it at some point and have money.","Republicans are good at standing by their candidate.","I do know something about the news world. I was sitting on the floors of newsrooms since I was seven years old, and I've been around them my whole life. I understand that someone looks at a story with famous people in it, and you want to put it out.","One of my favorite films is 'Big Fish,' which I think is a masterpiece.","I grew up in a family of storytellers, but Google has destroyed us because you can fact-check everything. We'd always like the stories to be a little better than they were.","I think one of the major misconceptions about me is that I live my life the way people think I lead my life, with hot and cold drinks running everywhere and a party all the time. They think of my life in terms of certain excesses that don't really exist. Things are actually fairly simple.","There is something very unsettling about being with someone when they die. People say it's peaceful. It's not peaceful. It's the most personal thing you can do, is die, and you feel almost like you're invading someone's most personal moment by being there.","I use my film-making to work through my deep questions and my deep problems. I think I could watch each film and tell you exactly which part of my psyche I'm trying to work out.","I think anyone who is famous is a moron if they're on Twitter. It's just stupid.","There's a funny thing about fame. The truth is you run as fast as you can towards it because it's everything you want. Not just the fame but what it represents, meaning work, meaning opportunity. And then you get there, and it's shocking how immediately you become enveloped in this world that is incredibly restricting."],"George Cole":["I was always in plays at school and in school concerts - you could say I liked to show off.","I was paid to be cheeky and people clapped me for it."],"George Colman":["Praise the bridge that carried you over.","On their own merits modest men are dumb.","And what 's impossible can't be, And never, never comes to pass.","Like two single gentlemen rolled into one.","Says he, 'I am a handsome man, but I'm a gay deceiver'.","Mum's the word."],"George Combe":["While some of them acknowledge the obligation of natural morality in their mode of conducting their cases, and preserve their individual character as gentlemen, there are others who acknowledge no law, human or divine, but the law of Scotland.","And if these be unprincipled agents who scruple at nothing, he will be a bold man who will deny that there are always to be found men at the bar who lend their services most cordially to back and support these agents in their most desperate cases.","We used to speak familiarly of an agent, now do more, who was accustomed to manufacture evidence, and to invent facts in his cases, or at least to alter the aspects of facts to such an extent that they might fairly be viewed as new.","The friends whom I have are invaluable, and although not numerous they are sufficient for my enjoyment; and the texture of my own mind renders me very indifferent to the rest of the world.","He has a number of curious facts in illustration of the power of mere goodness to protect against outrage.","They are few in the midst of an overwhelming mass of brute force, and their submission is wisdom; but for a nation like England to submit to be robbed by any invader who chooses to visit her shores seemed to me to be nonsense.","Phrenology taught us that the mind thinks by means of the brain, is liable to become fatigued by too long attention, as the locomotive muscles are by too much walking; and I therefore proposed to them to take a brief rest.","I called their attention also to the absence of all means of ventilating the hall, remarking that, as we had already breathed the air which it contained for a full hour, it must have lost much of its vital properties and needed to be renewed.","I requested the gentlemen to put on their hats, and the ladies their shawls, to avoid catching cold, and then had the windows widely opened. This proceeding caused some astonishment and alarm at first; for the Americans generally have a dread of cold air.","The interval allowed was only five minutes, at the end of which I resumed the lecture; but so refreshing was the effects of the brief rest and, above all, the admission of pure air, that during the second hour the attention was as completely sustained as during the first.","The same practice was continued every evening through the whole course, and with the same success. Many individuals expressed their gratification at having discovered such simple means of relieving the tedium of a long discourse."],"George Crabbe":["A great lie is like a great fish on dry land; it may fret and fling and make a frightful bother, but it cannot hurt you. You have only to keep still, and it will die of itself.","To sigh, yet not recede; to grieve, yet not repent.","Better to love amiss than nothing to have loved.","Feed the musician, and he's out of tune.","To the house of a friend if you're pleased to retire, You must all things admit, you must all things admire; You must pay with observance the price of your treat, You must eat what is praised, and must praise what you eat.","Our farmers round, well pleased with constant gain, Like other farmers, flourish and complain.","Be there a will, and wisdom finds a way.","With eye upraised his master's looks to scan, The joy, the solace, and the aid of man; The rich man's guardian, and the poor man's friend, The only creature faithful to the end.","To show the world what long experience gains, requires not courage, though it calls for pains; but at life's outset to inform mankind is a bold effort of a valiant mind.","In her experience all her friends relied, Heaven was her help and nature was her guide.","The game is never lost till won."],"George Crook":["We must not try to force him to take civilization immediately in its complete form, but under just laws, guaranteeing to Indians equal civil laws, the Indian question, a source of such dishonor to our country and of shame to true patriots, will soon be a thing of the past.","All the tribes tell the same story. They are surrounded on all sides, the game is destroyed or driven away; they are left to starve, and there remains but one thing for them to do - fight while they can.","The Indian is a human being.","I at once commenced the ascent through a shower of arrows.","When I jerked it out the head remained in my leg, where it remains still. There were a couple of inches of blood on the shaft of the arrow when I pulled it out.","During the engagement I tried to throw a strong force through the canon, but I was obliged to use it elsewhere before it had gotten to the supposed location of the village.","It demonstrates to his simple mind in the most positive manner that we have no prejudice against him on account of his race, and that while he behaves himself he will be treated the same as a white man.","The buffalo is all gone, and an Indian can't catch enough jack rabbits to subsist himself and his family, and then, there aren't enough jack rabbits to catch. What are they to do?","Give these Indians little farms, survey them, let them put fences around them, let them have their own horses, cows, sheep, things that they can call their own, and it will do away with tribal Indians.","When once an Indian sees that his food is secure, he does not care what the chief or any one else says.","The great mistake these people make is that they go to looking after the spiritual welfare of the Indians before securing their physical.","If you will investigate all the Indian troubles, you will find that there is something wrong of this nature at the bottom of all of them, something relating to the supplies, or else a tardy and broken faith on the part of the general government.","It has been my aim throughout present operations to afford the greatest amount of protection to life and property interests, and troops have been stationed accordingly.","It may be, however, that I am too much wedded to my own views in the matter, and as I have spent nearly eight years of the hardest work of my life in this department, I respectfully request that I may now be relieved from its command.","First, take the government of the Indians out of politics; second, let the laws of the Indians be the same as those of the whites; third, give the Indian the ballot.","But we must not try to drive the Indians too fast in effecting these changes.","The white men in the East are like birds. They are hatching out their eggs every year, and there is not room enough in the East, and they must go elsewhere; and they come out West, as you have seen them coming for the last few years."],"George Crumb":["The retrospective glance is a relatively easy gesture for us to make.","The future will be the child of the past and the present, even if a rebellious child.","The development of new instrumental and vocal idioms has been one of the remarkable phenomena of recent music.","I pick up the New York Times or Time and it's talking about the latest rock group, which I'm sure is exciting to some people, but it neglects a huge area of music.","In a broader sense, the rhythms of nature, large and small - the sounds of wind and water, the sounds of birds and insects - must inevitably find their analogues in music.","As interesting as that music can occasionally be, I don't think it really replaces the other.","Writing seems to be more difficult as you move through the years.","It is easy to write unthinking music.","I think we're in a very low point of music right now.","This is not a happy time for this kind of music in this country.","Most of my influences are turn-of-the-century.","I must confess, my Spanish is not so good - except I read a little, so I started with the English but then determined that it would have to be in Spanish.","If we look at music history closely, it is not difficult to isolate certain elements of great potency which were to nourish the art of music for decades, if not centuries.","I am certain that most composers today would consider today's music to be rich, not to say confusing, in its enormous diversity of styles, technical procedures, and systems of esthetics.","One very important aspect of our contemporary musical culture - some might say the supremely important aspect - is its extension in the historical and geographical senses to a degree unknown in the past.","I have observed, too, that the people of the many countries that I have visited are showing an ever increasing interest in the classical and traditional music of their own cultures.","Unquestionably, our contemporary world of music is far richer, in a sense, than earlier periods, due to the historical and geographical extensions of culture to which I have referred.","Nonetheless, I sense that it will be the task of the future to somehow synthesize the sheer diversity of our present resources into a more organic and well-ordered procedure.","The advent of electronically synthesized sound after World War II has unquestionably had enormous influence on music in general.","Perhaps of all the most basic elements of music, rhythm most directly affects our central nervous system.","Perhaps many of the perplexing problems of the new music could be put into a new light if we were to reintroduce the ancient idea of music being a reflection of nature.","Although technical discussions are interesting to composers, I suspect that the truly magical and spiritual powers of music arise from deeper levels of our psyche.","I am optimistic about the future of music.","I frequently hear our present period described as uncertain, confused, chaotic.","Perhaps two million years ago the creatures of a planet in some remote galaxy faced a musical crisis similar to that which we earthly composers face today."],"George Cukor":["Looking for love is tricky business, like whipping a carousel horse.","Unless the story line carries the scenes, the scenes don't really mean anything.","When one deals with stars, he is dealing with intelligent people. If they weren't intelligent, they wouldn't have arrived at the star pinnacle.","The truth is, a director wins an Oscar for a writer's script and actors' performances.","You can't have any successes unless you can accept failure.","If she was a victim of any kind, she was a victim of her friends.","Anyone who looked at something special, in a very original way, makes you see it that way forever.","People who aren't complicated in real life come through as pretty bland on the screen. Most great performers are not very happy and well adjusted. Perhaps that's the price they pay for being originals.","So many directors say nothing beautifully, and so many others say great and profound things but have no idea how to read a light meter or arrange a shot.","You can always land on your feet if you know where the ground is.","I suppose they call me a woman's director because there were all these movie queens in the old days, and I directed most of them. But I also directed Jack Barrymore and Ronald Colman and James Stewart, to name a few.","You're just poor cornball provincial people, you critics; you just don't know what the hell you're talking about.","Women's director! Well, I'm very pleased to be considered a master of anything, but remember, for every Jill there was a Jack. People like to pigeonhole you - it's a shortcut, I guess, but once they do, you're stuck with it.","I choose my actors well and get to know the quirks of their personalities - and, most of all, I share humor with them. Then I keep my eyes open when they rehearse and perform, because you never know where the next stimulation comes from.","I was a stage-struck kid.","It is reassuring for people to feel they have a boss, someone who knows the answers and has charted the course.","As a professional, it pains me to watch a movie that is botched and amateurish. I prefer directors who have control of both their craft and their ideas.","From the director's point of view, it's infinitely easier to do violence than to do a good dramatic scene.","Give me a good script, and I'll be a hundred times better as a director.","If I were very handsome, maybe I'd have been an actor.","I don't think you can teach people how to be funny. You can make suggestions about how to speak a line or get a laugh, but it has to be in them.","I work through the actors, and the more successful I am, the less my work is apparent.","It never occurred to me that I could live in California. Now I can't imagine living anywhere else.","If there is such a thing as 'a Cukor style,' I guess it arises out of two principal factors: my own personalized perception of the world and my ability to deal professionally with actors. As far as perception is concerned, I always try to imagine settings through the best possible eyes.","We've all been tired and thought we wanted a long vacation when all we needed was a few days off, but didn't know it."],"George Dennison Prentice":["The pen is a formidable weapon, but a man can kill himself with it a great deal more easily than he can other people.","Some people use one half their ingenuity to get into debt, and the other half to avoid paying it.","A word of kindness is seldom spoken in vain, while witty sayings are as easily lost as the pearls slipping from a broken string.","Much smoking kills live men and cures dead swine.","It is in vain to hope to please all alike. Let a man stand with his face in what direction he will, he must necessarily turn his back on one half of the world.","Some people seem as if they can never have been children, and others seem as if they could never be anything else.","A friend you have to buy won't be worth what you pay for him.","A bare assertion is not necessarily the naked truth.","There are many men whose tongues might govern multitudes if they could govern their tongues.","When a young man complains that a young lady has no heart, it's pretty certain that she has his.","A pin has as much head as some authors and a good deal more point."],"George Deukmejian":["The difference in golf and government is that in golf you can't improve your lie."],"George Downing":["We go by the lighthouse; paddle out.

He was an electric violinist.","Frank liked me because I went nuts on the piano using feet, head, whatever I could find to bang on the piano.","I mean this record does not sound like somebody's maiden voyage.","I also hope that with the assistance and expertise of Dome Records, that I will be able to further pierce the UK and European market. I really like playing there and I want to do more! I've found that the audiences get quite involved and really listen to what's happening.","Well, since I produce and pay for my own albums, it is the ultimate freedom.","I've developed an audience over the years and I don't want to loose them.","At the same time, I definitely want to expand my fan base but not at the expense of prostituting my music or heart.","I would much prefer that they take me as I am, that way the experience is genuine between the both of us.","I'm also working on a track for Howard Hewett, and a theme for a new NPR show.","I'm really looking forward to playing in Copenhagen again. Last time I stayed as long as I could, took pictures, signed autographs, and hung out until they through me out of the place!","I'm planning a different show, though for obvious reasons some of the material will be the same, and of course I will perform material from the new CD.","We're performing several shows in the Canary Islands."],"George Dyson":["The unlimited replication of information is generally a public good.","Alan Turing gave us a mathematical model of digital computing that has completely withstood the test of time. He gave us a very, very clear description that was truly prophetic.","If you spend time alone in the wilderness, you get very attuned to living things.","Digital organisms, while not necessarily any more alive than a phone book, are strings of code that replicate and evolve over time. Digital codes are strings of binary digits - bits.","When you click on a link, you are replicating the string of code that it links to. Replication of code sequences isn't life, any more than replication of nucleotide sequences is, but we know that it sometimes leads to life.","Last time I checked, the digital universe was expanding at the rate of five trillion bits per second in storage and two trillion transistors per second on the processing side.","We could construct a machine that is more intelligent than we can understand. It's possible Google is that kind of thing already. It scales so fast.","I have had a Twitter account since the very beginning but have never used it: I haven't tweeted anything, and I haven't followed anyone.","I read the Drudge Report!

It's because somebody built this self-replicating process."],"George Dzundza":["Throughout the course of my life, I've been blessed to work with extremely talented people.","The writers are writing human beings, and they're writing about the human condition and how difficult it is to function in that condition. I think it's one of the charms of the show, the idea of redemption and working towards becoming better people, for everybody involved.","My concern has always been that people who I portray, or the professions that I portray, are not embarrassed by my portrayal of them.","If you know you're going to be outside, you have to be a little bit more in tune, so that you don't get distracted by what's going on and focus better.","I love Philadelphia.

I see biology as being the greatest area of scientific breakthroughs in the next generation.","I was interested in science before I even knew what science was."],"George Eads":["Over the years, I've gotten a little bit thick-skinned when it comes to the acting thing.","Any time you put a cast like this in compromising circumstances or shake it up a little bit, I think we're all pretty close so we draw on real emotion.","Most of my stuff before CSI was kind of the jerk boyfriend, so I thought this was one of those deals, where these two have a thing going on, so we had a scene where they make out.","One lady wrote me and told me how she wants to see me get beat up and near death and that kind of stuff.","I think what's always been interesting to me than the science and the criminality with this job is what happens to your persona, your disposition, after day in and day out dealing with life and death.","I think my character's getting to the point where he can't even eat spaghetti with red sauce anymore, where he has horrible nightmares, he can't sleep anymore.","I love what I do and I love the fans.","I work so hard for the fans who watch our show.","No, there are some location shoots in Vegas, maybe four trips a year.

What comes back is a new morning every day in the year, and that's better.","My first recollection of hearing Wendell Phillips is from my college days, though of course he was always one of my heroes, and I may have heard him before, for we were an anti-slavery family.","Art does not, like science, set forth a permanent order of nature, the enduring skeleton of law. Two factors primarily determine its works: one is the idea in the mind of the artist, the other is his power of expression; and both these factors are extremely variable.","We foresee no limit to scientific advancement in the future, and in scientific truth there is nothing dead; science is always a living and growing body of knowledge; but art on the contrary has many times run its course to an end, and exhausted its vital power.","The growth of art seems to be in cycles, and often its vigorous lifetime is restricted to a century or two. The periods of distinctive drama, Greek, English, Spanish, fall within such a limit; the schools of painting and sculpture likewise; and, in poetry, the Victorian age or the school of Pope will serve as examples.","Art has a double visage: it looks before and after. Romance is its forward-looking face. The germ of growth is in romanticism. Formalism, on the other hand, consolidates tradition; gleans what has been gained and makes it facile to the hand or the mind; economizes the energy of genius.","From the beginning, about the rude altar of the god, to the days of Goethe, of Leopardi, and of Victor Hugo, the poet is the leader in the dance of life; and the phrase by which we name his singularity, the poetic temperament, denotes the primacy of that passion in his blood with which the frame of other men is less richly charged.","I believe that ideal character in its perfection is potentially in every man who is born into the world.","A marvellous power of expression over language often distinguishes genius; but Shakespeare in his phrases seems independent of the bonds of language as of the bonds of metre.","Is there not an art, a music, and a stream of words that shalt be life, the acknowledged voice of life?","Left to themselves, things tend to go from bad to worse. Murphy's First Corollary If you tell the boss you were late for work because you had a flat tire, the next morning you will have a flat tire.","I seldom deal in symbolisms; if there be hidden meanings in my verse, they are there without my knowledge.","The critic is genius at one remove; he is not unlike an actor on the stage, and incarnates in his mind, as the actor embodies in his person, another's work; only thus does he understand art, realize it, know it; and having arrived at this, his task is done.","One can re-create what was in the mind of a mathematician a thousand years ago, recapture the truth of the intellect wherever it may have once come to light; but the image of art, that infinite variable of perception and expression in the individual, - that is not easily re-created, at least, not with certainty and in its original fulness.","Art is expression; what is expressed is often the vision of a subtle and powerful soul, and also his experience with his vision; and however vivid and skilful he may be in the means of expression, yet it is frequently found that the master-spell in his work is something felt to be indefinable and inexpressible.","Aesthetic freedom is like free speech; it is, indeed, a form of free speech.","You may name a bronze statue 'Liberty,' or a painted figure in a city hall 'Commerce,' or a marble form in a temple 'Athene' or 'Venus;' but what is really there is only a representation of a single woman.","Genius is that in which the soul of a race bums at its brightest, revealing and preserving its vision; works of art are great and significant in proportion to the clarity and fulness with which they incarnate this vision.","It is not meant that the artist, in arriving at truth, must follow the way of the scientist, or, in stating it, the way of the philosopher.","Who of English speech, bred to the traditions of his race, does not recognize Hamlet in his 'inky cloak' at a glance? Not to know him would argue one's self untaught in the chief glories of his language.","To realize life in the abstract as noble or beautiful or humane, to set it forth so with radiance upon it, that is civilization in the arts. Shakespeare is the chief modern example of this supreme faculty of mankind.","Our understanding of Shakespeare already depends largely on the vitality of Renaissance elements in our education. Each man must live in his own generation, as the saying is; but the generations are bound together by the golden links of the great tradition of civilization.","A writer is justly called 'universal' when he is understood within the limits of his civilization, though that be bounded by a country or an age.","Seasonal changes, as it were, take place in history, when there is practically an almost universal death, a falling of the foliage of the tree of life. Such were the intervals between the ancient and mediaeval time, the mediaeval and the modern.","Shakespeare has been praised in English more than anything mortal except poetry itself. Fame exhausts thought in his eulogy.","A nation's poets are its true owners; and by the stroke of the pen they convey the title-deeds of its real possessions to strangers and aliens.","The world is a multiplicity, a harvest-field, a battle-ground; and thence arises through human contact ways of numbering, or mathematics, ways of tillage, or agriculture, ways of fighting, or military tactics and strategy, and these are incorporated in individuals as habits of life.","The language of literature is the language of all the world. It is necessary to divest ourselves at once of the notion of diversified vocal and grammatical speech which constitutes the various tongues of the Earth, and conceals the identity of image and logic in the minds of all men.","Words are intermediary between thought and things. We express ourselves really not through words, which are only signs, but through what they signify - through things.","Much of a poet's experience takes place in imagination only; the life he tells is oftenest the life that he strongly desires to live, and the power, the purity and height of his utterance may not seldom be the greater because experience here uses the voices of desire.","The Greeks, those originators of the intellectual life, fixed for us the idea of the poet. He was a divine man; more sacred than the priest, who was at best an intermediary between men and the gods, but in the poet the god was present and spoke.","The poet craves emotion, and feeds the fire that consumes him, and only under this condition is he baptized with creative power.","The great effort of civilization has been, and still is, the attempt to introduce a principle of control into that casual swarm of impressions which makes up men's thought and of which, especially with swayed by emotion, spontaneous action is the law.","Always, some great culture is dying to enrich the soil of new harvests, some civlization is crumbling to rubbish to be the hill of a more beautiful city, some race is spending itself that a lower and more barbarous world may inherit its stored treasure house.","It does not appear to me to be open to question that there is in the soul of man a nature and an order obtaining in it as permanent and universal as in the material world.","Mankind is the grandest and surest artist of all, and history as it clarifies is, in pure fact, an artistic process, a creation in its fullness of the beautiful soul."],"George Eliot":["Life began with waking up and loving my mother's face.","It is never too late to be what you might have been.","Animals are such agreeable friends - they ask no questions; they pass no criticisms.","Blessed is the influence of one true, loving human soul on another.","The beginning of compunction is the beginning of a new life.","The strongest principle of growth lies in the human choice.","It will never rain roses: when we want to have more roses we must plant more trees.","Adventure is not outside man; it is within.","He was like a cock who thought the sun had risen to hear him crow.","Delicious autumn! My very soul is wedded to it, and if I were a bird I would fly about the earth seeking the successive autumns.","Our dead are never dead to us, until we have forgotten them.","Wear a smile and have friends; wear a scowl and have wrinkles.","Great things are not done by impulse, but by a series of small things brought together.","The golden moments in the stream of life rush past us, and we see nothing but sand; the angels come to visit us, and we only know them when they are gone.","Failure after long perseverance is much grander than never to have a striving good enough to be called a failure.","The world is full of hopeful analogies and handsome, dubious eggs, called possibilities.","Only in the agony of parting do we look into the depths of love.","What makes life dreary is the want of a motive.","If we had a keen vision of all that is ordinary in human life, it would be like hearing the grass grow or the squirrel's heart beat, and we should die of that roar which is the other side of silence.","What do we live for, if not to make life less difficult for each other?","Rome - the city of visible history, where the past of a whole hemisphere seems moving in funeral procession with strange ancestral images and trophies gathered from afar.","Hobbies are apt to run away with us, you know; it doesn't do to be run away with. We must keep the reins.","All meanings, we know, depend on the key of interpretation.","Little children are still the symbol of the eternal marriage between love and duty.","We must not sit still and look for miracles; up and doing, and the Lord will be with thee. Prayer and pains, through faith in Christ Jesus, will do anything.","Conscientious people are apt to see their duty in that which is the most painful course.","Perhaps the most delightful friendships are those in which there is much agreement, much disputation, and yet more personal liking.","There are many victories worse than a defeat.","That's what a man wants in a wife, mostly; he wants to make sure one fool tells him he's wise.","Belief consists in accepting the affirmations of the soul; unbelief, in denying them.","We hand folks over to God's mercy, and show none ourselves.","We must find our duties in what comes to us, not in what might have been.","Iteration, like friction, is likely to generate heat instead of progress.","An election is coming. Universal peace is declared, and the foxes have a sincere interest in prolonging the lives of the poultry.","Marriage must be a relation either of sympathy or of conquest.","But that intimacy of mutual embarrassment, in which each feels that the other is feeling something, having once existed, its effect is not to be done away with.","What greater thing is there for two human souls than to feel that they are joined - to strengthen each other - to be at one with each other in silent unspeakable memories.","It seems to me we can never give up longing and wishing while we are thoroughly alive. There are certain things we feel to be beautiful and good, and we must hunger after them.","It is easy to say how we love new friends, and what we think of them, but words can never trace out all the fibers that knit us to the old.","Cruelty, like every other vice, requires no motive outside of itself; it only requires opportunity.","The years between fifty and seventy are the hardest. You are always being asked to do things, and yet you are not decrepit enough to turn them down.","You should read history and look at ostracism, persecution, martyrdom, and that kind of thing. They always happen to the best men, you know.","Jealousy is never satisfied with anything short of an omniscience that would detect the subtlest fold of the heart.","There is a sort of jealousy which needs very little fire; it is hardly a passion, but a blight bred in the cloudy, damp despondency of uneasy egoism.","People who can't be witty exert themselves to be devout and affectionate.","Blessed is the man, who having nothing to say, abstains from giving wordy evidence of the fact.","Our deeds still travel with us from afar, and what we have been makes us what we are.","Opposition may become sweet to a man when he has christened it persecution.","But what we call our despair is often only the painful eagerness of unfed hope.","Anger and jealousy can no more bear to lose sight of their objects than love.","I'm not denyin' the women are foolish. God Almighty made 'em to match the men.","When death comes it is never our tenderness that we repent from, but our severity.","What loneliness is more lonely than distrust?","Excessive literary production is a social offense.","Different taste in jokes is a great strain on the affections.","There is no despair so absolute as that which comes with the first moments of our first great sorrow, when we have not yet known what it is to have suffered and be healed, to have despaired and have recovered hope.","Excellence encourages one about life generally; it shows the spiritual wealth of the world.","There is no private life which has not been determined by a wider public life.","Might, could, would - they are contemptible auxiliaries.","There is a great deal of unmapped country within us which would have to be taken into account in an explanation of our gusts and storms.","You may try but you can never imagine what it is to have a man's form of genius in you, and to suffer the slavery of being a girl.","The egoism which enters into our theories does not affect their sincerity; rather, the more our egoism is satisfied, the more robust is our belief.","The important work of moving the world forward does not wait to be done by perfect men.","The responsibility of tolerance lies with those who have the wider vision.","No story is the same to us after a lapse of time; or rather we who read it are no longer the same interpreters.","In the vain laughter of folly wisdom hears half its applause.","In every parting there is an image of death.","I like not only to be loved, but also to be told I am loved.","When we get to wishing a great deal for ourselves, whatever we get soon turns into mere limitation and exclusion.","The beginning of an acquaintance whether with persons or things is to get a definite outline of our ignorance.","Breed is stronger than pasture.","The happiest women, like the happiest nations, have no history.","Knowledge slowly builds up what Ignorance in an hour pulls down.","No evil dooms us hopelessly except the evil we love, and desire to continue in, and make no effort to escape from.","Will not a tiny speck very close to our vision blot out the glory of the world, and leave only a margin by which we see the blot? I know no speck so troublesome as self.","Whether happiness may come or not, one should try and prepare one's self to do without it.","An ass may bray a good while before he shakes the stars down.","It is a narrow mind which cannot look at a subject from various points of view.","We long for an affection altogether ignorant of our faults. Heaven has accorded this to us in the uncritical canine attachment.","Acting is nothing more or less than playing. The idea is to humanize life.","I like trying to get pregnant. I'm not so sure about childbirth.","Our deeds determine us, as much as we determine our deeds.","Consequences are unpitying.","Nothing is so good as it seems beforehand.","When death, the great reconciler, has come, it is never our tenderness that we repent of, but our severity.","It is a common enough case, that of a man being suddenly captivated by a woman nearly the opposite of his ideal.","One must be poor to know the luxury of giving!","Ignorant kindness may have the effect of cruelty; but to be angry with it as if it were direct cruelty would be an ignorant unkindness.","No great deed is done by falterers who ask for certainty.","But human experience is usually paradoxical, that means incongruous with the phrases of current talk or even current philosophy.","Is it not rather what we expect in men, that they should have numerous strands of experience lying side by side and never compare them with each other?","Death is the king of this world: 'Tis his park where he breeds life to feed him. Cries of pain are music for his banquet.","The only failure one should fear, is not hugging to the purpose they see as best.","There is only one failure in life possible, and that is not to be true to the best one knows.","I desire no future that will break the ties with the past.","A difference of taste in jokes is a great strain on the affections.","Harold, like the rest of us, had many impressions which saved him the trouble of distinct ideas.","The finest language is mostly made up of simple unimposing words.","And when a woman's will is as strong as the man's who wants to govern her, half her strength must be concealment.","The sons of Judah have to choose that God may again choose them. The divine principle of our race is action, choice, resolved memory.","I'm proof against that word failure. I've seen behind it. The only failure a man ought to fear is failure of cleaving to the purpose he sees to be best.","More helpful than all wisdom is one draught of simple human pity that will not forsake us.","In all private quarrels the duller nature is triumphant by reason of dullness.","Quarrel? Nonsense; we have not quarreled. If one is not to get into a rage sometimes, what is the good of being friends?","The intense happiness of our union is derived in a high degree from the perfect freedom with which we each follow and declare our own impressions.","Our words have wings, but fly not where we would.","I have the conviction that excessive literary production is a social offence.","All the learnin' my father paid for was a bit o' birch at one end and an alphabet at the other.","The reward of one duty is the power to fulfill another.","To have in general but little feeling, seems to be the only security against feeling too much on any particular occasion.","In spite of his practical ability, some of his experience had petrified into maxims and quotations.","Falsehood is easy, truth so difficult.","Genius at first is little more than a great capacity for receiving discipline.","Vanity is as ill at ease under indifference as tenderness is under a love which it cannot return.","A toddling little girl is a centre of common feeling which makes the most dissimilar people understand each other.","No compliment can be eloquent, except as an expression of indifference.","The best augury of a man's success in his profession is that he thinks it the finest in the world.","It always remains true that if we had been greater, circumstance would have been less strong against us.","Truth has rough flavours if we bite it through.","Every woman is supposed to have the same set of motives, or else to be a monster.","There are some cases in which the sense of injury breeds not the will to inflict injuries and climb over them as a ladder, but a hatred of all injury.","A woman's heart must be of such a size and no larger, else it must be pressed small, like Chinese feet; her happiness is to be made as cakes are, by a fixed recipe.","For what is love itself, for the one we love best? An enfolding of immeasurable cares which yet are better than any joys outside our love.","Mortals are easily tempted to pinch the life out of their neighbour's buzzing glory, and think that such killing is no murder.","Science is properly more scrupulous than dogma. Dogma gives a charter to mistake, but the very breath of science is a contest with mistake, and must keep the conscience alive.","Worldly faces never look so worldly as at a funeral. They have the same effect of grating incongruity as the sound of a coarse voice breaking the solemn silence of night.","I should like to know what is the proper function of women, if it is not to make reasons for husbands to stay at home, and still stronger reasons for bachelors to go out.","Hostesses who entertain much must make up their parties as ministers make up their cabinets, on grounds other than personal liking.","Play not with paradoxes. That caustic which you handle in order to scorch others may happen to sear your own fingers and make them dead to the quality of things."],"George Emil Palade":["For a scientist, it is a unique experience to live through a period in which his field of endeavour comes to bloom - to be witness to those rare moments when the dawn of understanding finally descends upon what appeared to be confusion only a while ago - to listen to the sound of darkness crumbling.","In 1973, I left the Rockefeller University to join the Yale University Medical School. The main reason for the move was my belief that the time had come for fruitful interactions between the new discipline of Cell Biology and the traditional fields of interest of medical schools, namely Pathology and Clinical Medicine.","My father, Emil Palade, was professor of philosophy, and my mother, Constanta Cantemir-Palade, was a teacher. The family environment explains why I acquired early in life great respect for books, scholars and education.","Since my high school years, I have been interested in history, especially in Roman history, a topic on which I have read rather extensively. The Latin that goes with this kind of interest proved useful when I had to generate a few terms and names for cell biology.","In the early 1950s, during the near avalanche of discoveries, rediscoveries, and redefinitions of subcellular components made possible by electron microscopy, those prospecting in this newly opened field were faced with the problem of what to do with their newly acquired wealth.","We finally understand in general terms how a cell is organized, how its specialized organs function in a well integrated manner to insure its survival and replication."],"George Etherege":["Next to coming to a good understanding with a new mistress, I love a quarrel with an old one.","When love grows diseased, the best thing we can do is to put it to a violent death; I cannot endure the torture of a lingering and consumptive passion."],"George Ezra":["I'm good in summer. My birthday is in summer. I don't like it when it's too hot, but, you know, blue skies, I think people genuinely loosen up a bit, and it's nicer.","Writing and playing songs is something that I've loved doing since the day I started. It's never been a chore; it's always a hobby. To be able to do that from day to day makes me believe I'm a very lucky person.","I've always been someone who needs someone with them to poke and annoy. I'm useless at being by myself.","When people say the words 'singer-songwriter,' I think they have an image in their heads of someone with an acoustic guitar who is a bit woe-is-me. I'd like to think that I'm not one of those. I'm quite a happy person.","The music that I first fell in love with was American music, really. Nothing against British acts - I love them and will forever - but on the whole, it was the art of American storytelling in the kind of folk and blues lyrics that, if you scratch a little bit, there's a heartbreaking story there.","I actually find it really hard to deal with people looking up to me or being interested in wanting a picture.","When I was younger, I used to love the idea of writing songs and performing them live. But that was all I thought about. I didn't think about people getting to know my face.","A lot of what I listened to growing up was blues, but also folk and indie music. So there's this marriage of songs that structurally are quite bluesy. Sound-wise, there's a lot of indie as well. But you can't really say I'm pop-blues, because that's insulting to blues. It just can't exist.","All I wanted to do was to perform my music, so I never really thought about photo shoots or music video shoots or interviews. You can't anticipate those things - you just can't plan this as a job.","I don't know if I'm relentlessly cheerful... more consistently relaxed.","The thing is, I'll always be a touring artist. It's what I am; that's what I love doing.","When I was 15 or so, I made a conscious decision to try and sing with a big voice. Everybody I listened to had these big voices, and I wanted to try it. The blessing is that I could.","When I was growing up, my brother liked the Beatles, and I liked the Rolling Stones. I think if I were a girl, Keith would be the one I fancied.","My first instrument was bass, and the first thing that I remember learning to play that was better than a few notes was Fleetwood Mac's 'The Chain.' If you're the guy who penned that bass riff, then you should probably be in some sort of fantasy band.","I've met other famous people, and what blows my mind is that when they get five minutes off, they're partying with other famous people. I wanna see my boys at home.","Some people don't care why they are famous; they just want to be famous, and that makes my skin crawl a bit.","I don't think I've ever worn anything other than black jeans and shirts. Quite simple, really, and quite casual.","Growing up, I listened to a lot of American singer/songwriters, so a lot of Tom Waits, Paul Simon - also Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan. And bands like Vampire Weekend.","I hate getting a McDonald's. I'm not a McDonald's person: you just feel crap afterwards.","I don't know how convincing I'd be as a soul cat. I'm a scrawny British kid.","You don't want to start writing songs about how your Twitter followers are going up, because one day Twitter won't exist, and you'll feel like an idiot.","My first kiss was actually in a graveyard.","I'm not a big pet fan. I remember the school used to have a hamster, and you used to take it home for a week at a time. I did that. I probably got bored of it within a day.","The year 2014 was a big year for my taste buds. They really stepped up their game. Like, I got into red wine, coffee and sushi for the first time. Well done, George.","You can't plan success with a creative field. So I enjoy it while it's here, and I know it won't be forever. Maybe one day I'll have to go back to flipping burgers, but for now I'm going to enjoy the cool things."],"George F. Kennan":["Heroism is endurance for one moment more.","The very concept of history implies the scholar and the reader. Without a generation of civilized people to study history, to preserve its records, to absorb its lessons and relate them to its own problems, history, too, would lose its meaning.","The best thing we can do if we want the Russians to let us be Americans is to let the Russians be Russian.","One sometimes feels a guest of one's time and not a member of its household.","The best an American can look forward to is the lonely pleasure of one who stands at long last on a chilly and inhospitable mountaintop where few have been before, where few can follow and where few will consent to believe he has been.","The accords were fig leaves of democratic procedure to hide the nakedness of Stalinist dictatorship."],"George Farquhar":["Necessity, the mother of invention.","Those who know the least obey the best.","Grant me some wild expressions, Heavens, or I shall burst.","Captain is a good travelling name and so I take it.","We are the men of intrinsic value, who can strike our fortunes out of ourselves, whose worth is independent of accidents in life, or revolutions in government: we have heads to get money, and hearts to spend it.","I have fed purely upon ale; I have eat my ale, drank my ale, and I always sleep upon ale.","Crimes, like virtues, are their own rewards.","When the blind lead the blind, no wonder they both fall into - matrimony.","There is no scandal like rags, nor any crime so shameful as poverty.","I believe they talked of me, for they laughed consumedly.","Money is the sinews of love, as of war.","Spare all I have, and take my life.","Poetry is a mere drug, Sir.","Charming women can true converts make, We love the precepts for the teacher's sake.","We love the precepts for the teacher's sake."],"George Fetherling":["The heart was always seen as the noblest of the internal organs as well as the most vital. The hearts of martyrs or future candidates for sainthood would be preserved, but never their livers, say, or the entrails - at least not on their own; it was either the heart by itself or the whole lot together.","Romantic ideas about the heart fly in the face of known fact, but that doesn't matter and never has. People many thousands of years ago knew that the heart is basically a blood pump, but that didn't keep them from also believing it was the seat of romantic love (and all other strong emotion).","I suffered from a quite severe speech impediment when I was young, and keeping a journal was part of the therapy.","Poets are accepted in Canada as practically nowhere else in the West because of their place in an officially supported and popularly endorsed Canadian culture. Yet, they are still bitter and argumentative, as poets elsewhere are, because they have no audience as such, only a sanctioned role in the cultural scheme of things.","There are many thousands of books on particular assassinations and on the subject in general, but nearly all of them deal with the victims, not the perpetrators."],"George Foreman":["It's great to reminisce about good memories of my past. It was enjoyable when it was today. So learning to enjoy today has two benefits: it gives me happiness right now, and it becomes a good memory later.","I get up in the morning looking for an adventure.","I was a tiger, a good fighter, in good shape, but I was always nervous before boxing matches.","Forgiveness is that subtle thread that binds both love and friendship. Without forgiveness, you may not even have a child one day.","I love the pigeons. I just raise them, period, and feed them. Pigeons go away, and they always come back. You get a touch of freedom, and then they are free to come back to you. I love the idea of pigeons.","It's very important that people know that I really enjoy everything that has happened to me. And I tell my kids... you're not going to be the tallest, fastest, prettiest, the best track runner, but you can be the nicest human being that someone has ever met in their life. And I just want to leave that legacy that being nice is a true treasure.","Just take one step at a time, trusting that God still has a plan for you, and He will make the best out of your situation.","Money is a good thing, but every morning you have to get up with something no one else in the world gets up with - that's that image. That face you see in the mirror, you got to love it, and you better do some things that you feel good about inside of you. Of course, money is going to come, but make certain that you do some good with it.","In boxing, I had a lot of fear. Fear was good. But, for the first time, in the bout with Muhammad Ali, I didn't have any fear. I thought, 'This is easy. This is what I've been waiting for'. No fear at all. No nervousness. And I lost.","I know from experience that you should never give up on yourself or others, no matter what.","The greatest asset, even in this country, is not oil and gas. It's integrity. Everyone is searching for it, asking, 'Who can I do business with that I can trust?'","Muhammad Ali is a true hero, and the fact there's something wrong with him is his badge of valour. He's a great man.","In raising children, life brings forth those things where you do what you should never have done and what I taught you never to do. And when my kids have done those things, I just kind of look at them and say, 'Now you know life.'","Heroes have a rough time because they stand up when they ought not to, they speak when they ought not to; they always have to go that extra mile.","That's my gift. I let that negativity roll off me like water off a duck's back. If it's not positive, I didn't hear it. If you can overcome that, fights are easy.","Generally when there's a lot of smoke... there's just a whole lot more smoke.","In 1973 I became heavyweight champion of the world with 38 victories, no defeats as a professional. You get to a point where you think you cannot lose. I felt like I had the greatest power with my fists, I was the strongest man in the world.","You may have even an ex-wife or an ex-husband, but you can never have ex-children.","I am so happy to be alive. That's the one thing I'd like for people to know. Sometimes people walk by and slip up and say the wrong thing about me, and I'll smile. They wonder why am I smiling. Because I'm happy that I'm alive.","So many of us have loved ones and people we really care about, and the only time we show affection is when they are gone. I have preached at funerals, and you see loved ones who didn't even say hello to dear ones when they were alive. Give them hugs, kisses while they are alive and need it.","People are hurt in love affairs and never recover, more than a boxing match.","Growing up poor, I didn't even have a lunch to take to school. Lunch was 26 cents, and we didn't even know what 26 cents looked like. I didn't love school because I wanted to disguise that I was poorer than everybody else.","Boxing is like jazz. The better it is, the less people appreciate it.","I'm a winner each and every time I go into the ring.","If you can maintain that integrity in whatever you do, you can't go wrong. That's what I tell my kids, anyway.","Heroes always have their scars. Some you can see, some you read about later on.","The fighters who give it all will be around for next year. Give it all you've got. Don't save anything.","I don't even think about a retirement program because I'm working for the Lord, for the Almighty. And even thought the Lord's pay isn't very high, his retirement program is, you might say, out of this world.","The referee is going to be the most important person in the ring tonight besides the fighters.","Boxing has been the most difficult thing I've ever done. The biggest challenge in my life. I was a boxer. That was hard. Everything else is pretty easy.","I feel that I had been rescued from the gutter by America. One day I was under the gutter, chased by police, thinking dogs were going to get me. I laid there listening to the dogs and the gutter. The next day, there I am standing on the Olympic platform, and you hear the anthem. I was proud.","When I left boxing in 1977 to be a preacher, I couldn't make a fist after I learned about Jesus Christ.","I want to keep fighting because it is the only thing that keeps me out of the hamburger joints. If I don't fight, I'll eat this planet.","George Foreman. A miracle. A mystery to myself. Who am I? The mirror says back. The George you was always meant to be. Wasn't always like that. Used to look in the mirror and cried a river.","Sure the fight was fixed. I fixed it with a right hand.","I've seen George Foreman shadow boxing and the shadow won.","I dread handshakes. I've got some problems with my hands, and everywhere I go, people want to impress me with their grip. To make it worse, now women are coming up with that firm shake.","All my sons are named George Foreman. They all know where they came from.","I look at my children and one thing I'm most proud of, in my heart, are my children.","Oh, there's nothing more dangerous in life at getting hurt at than love itself. People are hurt in love affairs and never recover, more than a boxing match.","I dread handshakes. I've got some problems with my hands, and everywhere I go, people want to impress me with their grip. To make it worse, now women are coming up with that firm shake. So I'll say, 'Gimme five!' If a boy wants a handshake, I'll just give him a hug.","It's strange because you - your life goes so swiftly. You look up one day you're a teenager, the next day you're a grandfather and you want to decide, 'I sure hope my kids don't make the same mistakes.'","My friends know that they're my friends - even my enemies know that they're my friends.","Every day, getting up early in the morning before much traffic, my wife takes me 10 miles from home, drops me off, and I have to get back.","My favorite drink is water - the bland one: Evian. I stick with that. I celebrate in the evening sometimes with Perrier. That's why I love coming to California. They're always talking to you about bottled water.","We'd always said boxers shouldn't lift weights. Now I realize some champion boxer started that rumor. I noticed if I did weights a couple of times a week, I would be able to hit that jab a lot longer. After sparring, everybody's gone, and I sneak into the weight room. Spend 40 minutes in there lifting weights.","I wanted to be the best street fighter in Houston, Texas. And I thought if I got a trophy or two, I'd go back home, and everyone would be afraid of me. I had one fight in '67, the first one. In '68 of October, I was an Olympic gold-medalist, a dream come true, with a total of 25 boxing matches.","I'm never without my dog. They would be in every corner of the house, and my wife will not allow me to have any more than that. But I have lots of dogs. I love the dogs. I breed them. I always have a puppy coming. And I show dogs. I show German shepherds.","My kids idea of a hard life is to live in a house with only one phone.","After you work out, you have your dog with you. There's no better companion. You've got to have a friend. I didn't like opponents who had dogs with them. Because you know they had a little edge. They have a friend.","You've got to keep a dog with you at all times. A dog cannot roam. You've got to keep him in the house with you. You can't have a wild dog and expect days to go good.","Sports are sports. Its all about how we carry ourselves out of the ring.","My mother was watching on television and she doesn't want me to hurt anyone.","A hero is someone right who doesn't change.","I am a winner each and every time I go into the ring.","The question isn't at what age I want to retire, it's at what income.","They'll take everything, even your tears.","The Internal Revenue Service is the real undefeated heavyweight champion.","Put your name on something, it better be the best... you only get one shot.","When I was a kid in Houston, we were so poor we couldn't afford the last 2 letters, so we called ourselves po'.","Everybody wants to be somebody. The thing you have to do is give them confidence they can. You have to give a kid a dream.","When I was a boxer, I wanted to be champion of the world, not the richest man in the world.","As a child I was sometimes so hungry that I used to dream that one day I'd get locked in a grocery store.","Changing your nature is the hardest thing to do. But I discovered that you can be who you choose to be.","You don't know what it is to be heavyweight champ of the world until you become the heavyweight champ of the world.","Evil lurks where disappointment lodges.","As a matter of fact, there was a period of time, especially in my first career, when that's the only one who would work out with me: my dogs. As you get better and better working out, there's no one who can keep up with you running.","A Jack Russell terrier? My god. He'll burn you up. They never stop. A German shepherd, you can only go so many miles.","All the dogs I have are German shepherds from Germany, and I fly them back to Germany to show them.","I hope to have one more boxing match at the age of 55. Given that demographic at the age of 55 to 65, you've got to make a statement with your life. Otherwise, you are just existing.","Sonny Liston stood up to me and actually made me give ground. No one has ever done that to me before or since.","I think its so good for boxing when a new guy or new blood as we call it, makes a big statement.","Just look at the great Nelson Mandela. He came out of prison and saved his entire country. Some of the best people in the world have spent time in prison.","But boxing was my profession. I had to go back the second time because I was broke and I couldn't just go and get a college degree and earn it. I had too many bills, too many families.","I cannot remember a time when I was not getting into fights.","I started a youth center in Houston. The kids would come in and want to learn to box; they wanted to tear up the world, beat up the world. And I'd try to show them they didn't need anger. They didn't need all that killing instinct they'd read about. You can be a human being and pursue boxing as a sport.","You don't have to try to hurt people and be angry to be an athlete.","It would be hard to throw a punch to someone who wasn't a boxer, who wasn't in the ring, and who didn't have on a pair of boxing gloves and who hadn't been training.","Preaching is the most original thing I've ever done. There's nothing familiar about it. You have to be brave.","I named all my sons George Edward Foreman. And I tell people, 'If you're going to get hit as many times as I've been hit by Mohammad Ali, Joe Frazier, Ken Norton, Evander Holyfield - you're not going to remember many names.'","I think that every boxer should understand he's on the pedestal for a short span. It's best that you use boxing and don't let boxing use you. Use boxing to sell, because people are selling you through your boxing career, so you have to learn to sell yourself, and you'll never starve.","'Iron' Mike Tyson is the last boxer who was truly embraced by the media. They followed him around. You didn't know what he was going to do next: bite you, cut you, fight you. When you think about it, that defines him - it was an exciting adventure.","I remember in school once the teacher gave us a speech about anyone can make it if they try, and then she looked at me and said. 'I don't know what you are going to do, Georgie.'","There shouldn't be budget problems. There is so much money that goes untapped. If every athlete gave 5% of what they earned, there wouldn't be any budget problems.","You wouldn't meet a Joe Frazier down today and then up tomorrow, said hello to big shots then ignore someone on the lower level; he was the most consistent human being. What you see is what you get.","Frazier was not a big man at all. Frazier was about 5'9, but he would make anyone run. Put up your dukes and cover up because he's coming. He never backed up from anyone.","I wanted to be champ of the world, but I kept hoping something would happen to Frazier. I didn't want to fight him. Nobody wanted to fight Joe Frazier.","When you're in a single-parent home, they try to give you a good foundation, but by the time you're 4 or 5 years old, from that point on you're pretty much on your own.","I never get upset about what I read in the newspaper. I realize that every human being can make a difference in this world.","As you get better and better working out, there's no one who can keep up with you running. If you don't have a good dog, it's going to be the most lonesome training camp you'll ever have.","I just don't know how I was able to be a boxer in the first place without believing God.","We all think we've got one more boxing match in us, and that, probably, will be the downfall of Floyd Mayweather, George Foreman, Manny Pacquiao. We'll overstay our welcome.","When I was in the ring, you really saw the best of me. Outside the ring, I was really some terrible fellow.","When you speak to a lot of kids, as I've done over the years, you know what to say, keep them laughing, good illustrations and learn to read.","When it gets to the part in life where you're more afraid of what your wife is going to do to you than if you box, say, Mike Tyson, you've got to get a new profession. You don't get to be a family. I know why boxers never quit, some of them. They don't have wives.","You got to look nice. If you got 10 kids, they'll talk about you if you don't look nice.","Getting up to Zaire - getting ready to fight Muhammad Ali - I thought this will be a matter of just a little exercise. I'll probably knock him out in three rounds. Two, three - maybe three and a half rounds. That was the most confidence I had in my whole life.","All of a sudden, one day, you're this boxer that everybody like, or you're this guy that people pass on the highway and wave at. The next day, you're this guy that everybody want to touch - be in touch with you. Then you think that this is the answer to all things.","I'm on the record for five losses or something like that, but the one guy who really whipped me was Muhammad Ali. And it taught me one big lesson. That no matter how big and strong you are, you're going to have to use your mind. You must think things out.","The integration of a headgear in professional boxing would do so much to make it safer for young men. They could go into the sport, make a lot of money and then come out and be good grandfathers.","You've got to have a focus. You just fight for money, you get hurt. You focus on the title, you'll just naturally make money doing it.","I got a strength coach. My wife. She gets big chains, and at night she puts them around the refrigerator. They are so strong, I can't break them.","If you learn to sell, it's worth more than a degree. It's worth more than the heavyweight championship of the world. It's even more important than having a million dollars in the bank. Learn to sell, and you'll never starve.","There are a lot of guys who are successful, they make a lot of big money, I mean millions overnight with a contract, and they don't understand the evaporation. It evaporates. You're always back to square one. I found that out, so integrity is how I do business. That's my main asset.","You want to leave something; you really do. I mean, in the end, statues and all those things, that doesn't mean anything. Leave something that we're all going to benefit from. I think that's what I'd like to do.","When I step into the ring with someone, this has got to be their vacation spot, but my home turf. So I go the opposite side seven rounds doing the same thing. Skipping, skipping, skipping. Then I go seven rounds going both ways. Skip to the left, skip to the right.","I've been on the opposite side of decisions before when the crowd would be booing and saying that I lost. I've lived with it. Judging in boxing has been same since the beginning, and it isn't gonna change.","We fought in 1974 - that was a long time ago. After 1981, we became the best of friends. By 1984, we loved each other. I am not closer to anyone else in this life than I am to Muhammad Ali. Why? We were forged by that first fight in Zaire, and our lives are indelibly linked by memories and photographs, as young men and old men.","I teach kids that want to be tough that their fists are not the way.","I want to tell everybody that there is really a living God.","I love the UFC. I love it. If they had had that back when I was coming up, in 1966, it would have been my sport. Man, I love it. And you know what? Nobody would have pulled the rope-a-dope on me.","I tell my sons all the time, 'The most important thing in your life is fitness,' but a lot of fighters go overboard.","The Olympic Gold medal in 1968 was definitely the highest moment of my career. It was a dream come true. I was a 19-year-old boy, and it was just amazing to be standing on top of the podium and hearing the National Anthem in the background.","I'd have to say losing the title to Ali in '74 was the lowest moment in sports for me. It was the most devastating thing in my boxing career, and it still hurts to this day.","The sport needs a personality, not a fighter. We've got plenty of great fighters in the sport, but no personalities. No one is standing for anything. The last personality we had was Mike Tyson. He stood for something. It wasn't much, but he stood for something.","Anytime I can sneak in a moment to fish and ride horses, I'm a happy camper.","They call it the rope-a-dope. Well, I'm the dope. Ali just laid on the rope and I, like a dope, kept punching until I got tired. But he was probably the most smart fighter I've ever gotten into the ring with."],"George Formby":["Now everybody's got a crazy notion of their own. Some like to mix up with a crowd, some like to be alone.

And in that sense, the suicide bomber is no different from the stealth bomber or the cruise missile. If it is targeted at civilian people, then it is morally wrong, whether done by Bush, Blair, or a suicide bomber.","It's clear enough that there was substantial fraud in Ohio, thus delivering the Electoral College vote for President Bush.","Bush, and Blair, and the prime minister of Japan, and Berlusconi, these people are criminals, and they are responsible for mass murder in the world, for the war, and for the occupation, through their support for Israel, and through their support for a globalized capitalist economic system, which is the biggest killer the world has ever known.","It is only losers that are prosecuted.","I'm demanding to be prosecuted. I'm begging to be prosecuted for perjury.","If you are asking did I support the Soviet Union, yes I did. Yes, I did support the Soviet Union, and I think the disappearance of the Soviet Union is the biggest catastrophe of my life.","Henry Kissinger is the greatest living war criminal in the world today, with the blood of millions of people in Vietnam and Cambodia and Laos and Chile and East Timor on his hands. He will never appear in a court or be behind bars.","I am an opponent of Saddam Hussein, but an opponent also, of the sanctions that have killed a million Iraqi children and an opponent of the United States' apparent desire to plunge the Middle East into a new and devastating war.","I was an opponent of Saddam Hussein when the British and American governments and businessmen were selling him guns and gas.","I have met Saddam Hussein exactly the same number of times as Donald Rumsfeld met him. The difference is that Donald Rumsfeld met him to sell him guns and to give him maps the better to target those guns.","MRSA, which is a kind of super bug mutant, is killing 10,000 people a year in Britain.","The big tyrants never face justice.","Anyone will say anything under torture.","Some things are too important to be left to the private sector.","I've had more than 12,000 emails from the United States. It's not easy in the United States to find out the email address of a British parliamentarian.","Even if you only counted the votes that actually made it through the hoops in order to be cast, the president was really Al Gore.","I'm an advocate of the great Dr. Johnson, the English man of letters who said that patriotism was the last refuge of the scoundrel.","We say here that if you fall down in the United States, the ambulance man must feel for your wallet before he feels for your pulse.","There are those who wrap themselves in flags and blow the tinny trumpet of patriotism as a means of fooling the people.","I think that both men, Bush and Blair, will be damned in history. Both men have made their respective countries the two most hated countries in the world.","Tony Blair will be remembered for nothing other than that he followed George W. Bush over a cliff; took the rest of us with them, and we haven't yet reached the bottom, I'm afraid.","George Bush doesn't represent any civilization!","I came to declare that I am a friend to Arabs, at a time when it is not easy to be friend to Arabs, because nowadays those who have ambitions and interests would not befriend Arab.","I have never solicited nor received money from Iraq for our campaign against war and sanctions. I have never seen a barrel of oil, never owned one, never bought one, never sold one.","I've never had a penny through oil deals and no one has produced a shred of evidence that I have.","I'm 51; I'm younger than Tony Blair. I don't have a dicky heart; I'm up like a broom handle in the morning. I don't drink or gamble - I'm still a catch.","I care about public perception, yes. I don't care about my enemies' perception.","In the Palestinian camps in the Seventies, I fell in love with a woman fighter - now married with six kids, not mine! - and I seriously considered staying there with her.","I think that Hassan Nasrallah is the best leader in the Muslim world.","Spare me this sanctimony about politeness, please. There are millions of people in this country who hate the very word 'Thatcher' and 'Thatcherism,' which continues until this day.","'9/11' came out of a swamp of hatred created by us.","I can assure you Mr. Zureikat never gave me a penny from an oil deal, a cake deal, a bread deal or from any other deal."],"George Gallup":["Polling is merely an instrument for gauging public opinion. When a president or any other leader pays attention to poll results, he is, in effect, paying attention to the views of the people. Any other interpretation is nonsense.","I could prove God statistically. Take the human body alone - the chances that all the functions of an individual would just happen is a statistical monstrosity."],"George Gamow":["My mother was the only girl in the family. One brother was District Attorney of Odessa or something; another was teaching classical languages; another was a captain of a battleship of the Black Navy; and still another was a chemist and icthyologist.","When, in school, they were teaching algebra, I was studying differential equations at home.","I learned Einstein's theory of relativity when I was still in school.

I'm sticking them here, but I don't have any reason for it.","I have a debt, a loyalty to the museum; the best place for me to do what I wanted to do.","Most of the dogmatic religions have exhibited a perverse talent for taking the wrong side on the most important concepts in the material universe, from the structure of the solar system to the origin of man.","Every paleontologist knows that most new species, genera, and families, and that nearly all categories above the level of family appear in the record suddenly and are not led up to by known, gradual, completely continuous transitional sequences.","Darwin recognized the fact that paleontology then seemed to provide evidence against rather for evolution in general or the gradual origin of taxonomic categories in particular.","Now we do have many examples of transitional sequences.","Almost all paleontologists recognize that the discovery of a complete transition is in any case unlikely.","Of course the orders all converge backward in time, to different degrees.","Man is the result of a purposeless and materialistic process that did not have him in mind. He was not planned.","He is a state of matter, a form of life, a sort of animal, and a species of the Order Primates, akin nearly or remotely to all of life and indeed to all that is material.","Certainly paleontologists have found samples of an extremely small fraction, only, of the earth's extinct species, and even for groups that are most readily preserved and found as fossils they can never expect to find more than a fraction."],"George Gaynes":["The two things an actor dreads most are children and dogs.","I was an acting opera singer, and that's one of the reasons I left opera.","It depends on the generation and gender. The males usually go for 'Police Academy,' and the young women now in their late 20s or so go for 'Punky Brewster.' I am recognized quite frequently because they're still playing that stuff on television!","For years, they cast me in these dumb straight roles of businessmen in three-piece suits.","I'm not foreign enough to play foreigners... I have sort of a mid-Atlantic British accent that puts me in the middle of everything, so they don't know quite where to put me.","To build a character like Henry Warnimont required a few weeks and months of work. It turned out he was basically a very kind and generous man, which he covered up with his surface gruffness and surface bluster. And the kind of hopeless quality, that 'everything goes wrong' kind of thing.","I brought what I could of myself to this thing, because between Henry Warnimont and I - not a hell of a lot of difference.","It should be easier to play opposite my wife.","My parents separated soon after I was born, so I left Helsinki when I was a year old. My mother took me to Paris and then other places throughout Western Europe.","It's nice to be in demand."],"George Gershwin":["Life is a lot like jazz... it's best when you improvise.","All great composers of the past spent most of their time studying. Feeling alone won't do the job. A man also needs technique.","I didn't even start playing the piano until I was about 13 or 14. I guess I must have had a little talent or whatever-you-call-it, but I practised regularly, and that's what counts.","Upper berth, lower berth, that's the difference between talent and genius.","True music must repeat the thought and inspirations of the people and the time.","It is always possible to create something original.","I frequently hear music in the very heart of noise.","The extraordinary thing about my mother, she's so modest about me.","When I'm in my normal mood, music drips from my fingers.","Why should I limit myself to only one woman when I can have as many women as I want?","Writing music is not so much inspiration as hard work.","I want to say at once that I frankly believe that Irving Berlin is the greatest songwriter that has ever lived.... His songs are exquisite cameos of perfection, and each one of them is as beautiful as its neighbor. Irving Berlin remains, I think, America's Schubert.","All these tales of people sitting down and composing symphonies just as though they were writing a letter are very much exaggerated; at least, it isn't that way in my work.","It took me three weeks to write the 'Rhapsody in Blue.' I had always wanted to write something blue and Paul Whiteman inspired."],"George Gilder":["This is what sexual liberation chiefly accomplishes - it liberates young women to pursue married men.","Television is not vulgar because people are vulgar; it is vulgar because people are similar in their prurient interests and sharply differentiated in their civilized concerns.","Intelligent design itself does not have any content.","The welfare culture tells the man he is not a necessary part of the family; he feels dispensable, his wife knows he is dispensable, his children sense it.","The differences between the sexes are the single most important fact of human society.","In embracing change, entrepreneurs ensure social and economic stability.","Real poverty is less a state of income than a state of mind.","The first priority of any serious program against poverty is to strengthen the male role in poor families."],"George Gillespie":["Reformation ends not in contemplation, but in action.","There is nothing which any way pertaineth to the worship of God left to the determination of human laws.","The pride of life hath corrupted the judgment of others, and perverted them in the way of religion.","There is no sinfulness in the will and affections without some error in the understanding. All lusts which a natural man lives in, are lusts of ignorance.","The Lord Jesus will be revealed mightily, and will make bare his holy Arm, as well in the confusion of Antichrist, as in the conversion of the Jews, before the last judgment, and the end of all things.","How small regard is had to the oath of God by men professing the name of God."],"George Gissing":["Time is money says the proverb, but turn it around and you get a precious truth. Money is time.","For the man sound of body and serene of mind there is no such thing as bad weather; every day has its beauty, and storms which whip the blood do but make it pulse more vigorously.","It is the mind which creates the world around us, and even though we stand side by side in the same meadow, my eyes will never see what is beheld by yours, my heart will never stir to the emotions with which yours is touched.","That is one of the bitter curses of poverty; it leaves no right to be generous.","Money is time. With money I buy for cheerful use the hours which otherwise would not in any sense be mine; nay, which would make me their miserable bondsman.","Persistent prophecy is a familiar way of assuring the event.","Flippancy, the most hopeless form of intellectual vice.","It is because nations tend towards stupidity and baseness that mankind moves so slowly; it is because individuals have a capacity for better things that it moves at all.","The first time I read an excellent work, it is to me just as if I gained a new friend; and when I read over a book I have perused before, it resembles the meeting of an old one.","Have the courage of your desire."],"George Gobel":["If it weren't for electricity, we'd all be watching television by candlelight.","When I go to a party, nobody says hello.

This in a short time disappeared, to be soon succeeded by another similar in character, but more faint.","On embarking to return we could perceive no sign of One Tree Island; and as we swept down towards the sea the leafy top of a tree seen in the clear water under the boat was the only evidence of its existence; though a few hours ago it had formed so prominent an object.","Spanish alone was understood or spoken here; our friend, the countryman, stuck to us most nobly, he understood us not a bit better than the rest but saw that we were in distress and would not desert us.","This part of Brazil offered the curious spectacle of a great evil, which has been long suffered to exist and is now advancing, gradually yet surely, to that state which must entail inevitable destruction on the existing Government of the country.","The Slave Trade, though nominally abolished, is actively pursued here, eighty-three slaves having been landed just before my arrival, and another cargo during my stay.","Part of my plan was not only to introduce all useful animals that I possibly could into this part of Australia, but also the most valuable plants of every description.","In front of us lay a smooth sandy beach, beyond which rose gradually a high wooded country, and behind us was the sea, studded with numerous islands of every variety of form.","I mention this fact as tending to support what I have often heard stated, namely, that a shark's sense of smell is so keen that, if men ever bathe in seas where they are found, a shark is almost sure to appear directly afterwards.","At several such places we landed, but always found the ascent to the interior so covered with large loose rocks that it would have been impossible to have disembarked stores or stock on any.","All the principal people in the town are concerned in the slave trade, and their chief wealth consists in the number of slaves they possess; therefore there is little chance of the trade being, for many years, totally abolished."],"George Grosz":["I was disappointed, not because we had lost the war but because our people had allowed it to go on for so many years, instead of heeding the few voices of protest against all that mass insanity and slaughter.","I stood up as best I could to their disgusting stupidity and brutality, but I did not, of course, manage to beat them at their own game. It was a fight to the bitter end, one in which I was not defending ideals or beliefs but simply my own self.","Peace was declared, but not all of us were drunk with joy or stricken blind.","I thought the war would never end. And perhaps it never did, either.","It's an old ploy of the bourgeoisie. They keep a standing 'art' to defend their collapsing culture.","The war was a mirror; it reflected man's every virtue and every vice, and if you looked closely, like an artist at his drawings, it showed up both with unusual clarity.","The bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie have armed themselves against the rising proletariat with, among other things, 'culture.'","What can I say about the First World War, a war in which I served as an infantryman, a war I hated at the start and to which I never warmed as it proceeded?","Very little changed fundamentally, except that the proud German soldier had turned into a defeated bundle of misery and the great German army had disintegrated.","I had grown up in a humanist atmosphere, and war to me was never anything but horror, mutilation and senseless destruction, and I knew that many great and wise people felt the same way about it.","The cult of individuality and personality, which promotes painters and poets only to promote itself, is really a business. The greater the 'genius' of the personage, the greater the profit.","In the end, they pardoned me and packed me off to a home for the shell-shocked. Shortly before the end of the war, I was discharged a second time, once again with the observation that I was subject to recall at any time.","In 1916 I was discharged from military service, or rather, given a sort of leave of absence on the understanding that I might be recalled within a few months.

One must learn from him who knows.","Laughter relieves us of superfluous energy, which, if it remained unused, might become negative, that is, poison. Laughter is the antidote.","It is the greatest mistake to think that man is always one and the same. A man is never the same for long. He is continually changing. He seldom remains the same even for half an hour.","Religion is doing; a man does not merely think his religion or feel it, he lives his religion as much as he is able, otherwise it is not religion but fantasy or philosophy.","Without struggle, no progress and no result. Every breaking of habit produces a change in the machine.","Every ceremony or rite has a value if it is performed without alteration. A ceremony is a book in which a great deal is written.

Before I left, I went to a tailor in Savile Row and asked him to make me a suit that I could wear in any climate and which I could use as a tuxedo, a dinner jacket, a lounge suit and a blazer.","I'm kind of like a relic from another era.","A lot of actors flame out.","I've never turned down an autograph request. I've never not taken a picture with someone.","It's hard for people to get their hands around fame, because it's heady stuff, and you have to look at it as being dangerous explosives, and you have to handle it with care.","Acting has always been something for me that's been a romp. I just show up and I have a good time, and I hope that I get through the day and I can have lunch in the sun.","My mother was a star-struck girl from a little town in Arkansas who had gone to finishing school in New York, and whose mother had given her anything she ever wanted.","I've gone to skin doctors and they'll say to you, 'We should remove this because it's pre-cancerous,' and I'll say, 'Explain pre-cancerous to me.' I'll listen for about twenty minutes and I'll say excuse me, 'Is pre-cancerous like pre-dead? So you're saying it could turn into cancer but it's not cancer?'","Democracy, if it meant what our forefathers said, that would be great, but unfortunately it's been corrupted by this funding and funding of campaigns. There's a much better way to do it. There could be a small amount of money given by every taxpayer to be dedicated to candidates.","I always adored Cary Grant. I was fascinated by him. But I could never get too close to him.","The truth of it is that women are far more logical than men.","Women love romance, but they're not as romantic as men."],"George Harrison":["All the world is birthday cake, so take a piece, but not too much.","It is better to be an outspoken atheist than a hypocrite.","When you've seen beyond yourself, then you may find, peace of mind is waiting there.","Gossip is the Devil's radio.","The Beatles saved the world from boredom.","Everything else can wait, but the search for God cannot wait.","With our love, we could save the world.","I'd rather be a musician than a rock star.","At death, you're going to be needing some spiritual guidance and some kind of inner knowledge that extends beyond the boundaries of the physical world... it's what's inside that counts.","In the end, you're trying to find God. That's the result of not being satisfied. And it doesn't matter how much money, or property, or whatever you've got, unless you're happy in your heart, then that's it. And unfortunately, you can never gain perfect happiness unless you've got that state of consciousness that enables that.","I'm really quite simple. I plant flowers and watch them grow... I stay at home and watch the river flow.","I just got so fed up with the bad vibes. I didn't care if it was the Beatles; I was getting out.","Try to realize it's all within yourself no one else can make you change, and to see you're only very small and life flows on within you and without you.","If I go to someplace like Switzerland, I find a lot of uptight people because they're living amongst so much beauty; there's no urgency in trying to find the beauty within themselves. If you're stuck in New York, you have to somehow look within yourself - otherwise, you'd go crackers.","I wanted to be successful, not famous.","People are simply screwing up when they go out and buy beefsteak, which is killing them with cancer and heart troubles. The stuff costs a fortune, too. You could feed a thousand people with lentil soup for the cost of half a dozen filets.","We were talking about the space between us all and the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion. Never glimpse the truth - then it's far too late when they pass away.","After all we did for Britain, selling that corduroy and making it swing, all we got was a bit of tin on a piece of leather.","Basically, I feel fortunate to have realized what the goal is in life. There's no point in dying having gone through your life without knowing who you are, what you are, or what the purpose of life is. And that's all it is.","Although I have guitars all around, and I pick them up occasionally and write a tune and make a record, I don't really see myself as a musician. It may seem a funny thing to say. It's just like, I write lyrics, and I make up songs, but I'm not a great lyricist or songwriter or producer. It's when you put all these things together - that makes me.","Down through the ages, there has always been the spiritual path. It's been passed on - it always will be - and if anybody ever wants it in any age, it's always there.","If we were all perfected beings, we wouldn't be here in the physical world.","As far as I'm concerned, there won't be a Beatles reunion as long as John Lennon remains dead.","People say I'm the Beatle who changed the most, but to me, that's what life's about.","I wanted to collaborate with someone, but it had to be someone I could work with and who wouldn't disrespect my past.","Most people think when the world gets itself together, we'll all be okay. I don't see that situation arriving. I think one by one, we all free ourselves from the chains we have chained ourselves to. But I don't think that suddenly some magic happens and the whole lot of us will all be liberated in one throw.","I think of myself as a jungle musician because of my lack of formal training.","Love one another.","There's high, and there's high, and to get really high - I mean so high that you can walk on the water, that high-that's where I'm going.","The biggest break in my career was getting into the Beatles in 1962. The second biggest break since then is getting out of them.","Some of the best songs that I know are the ones I haven't written yet, and it doesn't even matter if I don't ever write them, because it's only small potatoes compared with the big picture.","The Beatles will exist without us.","Hippies are so phoney and fake.","The world used us as an excuse to go mad.","If we'd know we were going to be the Beatles, we'd have tried harder.","At the point we finished 'Abbey Road,' the game was up. We all accepted that.","As long as you hate, there will be people to hate.","To the best of my knowledge, none of the Beatles can read music.","The Beatles exist apart from myself. I am not really Beatle George. Beatle George is like a suit or shirt that I once wore on occasion, and until the end of my life, people may see that shirt and mistake it for me.","If you want to be popular and famous, you can do it; it's dead easy if you have that ego desire. But most of my ego desires as far as being famous and successful were fulfilled a long time ago.","If I write a tune and people think it's nice, then that's fine by me, but I hate having to compete and promote the thing. I really don't like promotion.","I just write a song, and it just comes out however it wants to. And some of them are catchy songs like 'Here Comes The Sun,' and some of them aren't, you know.","The best slide solo I ever played was on... what's her name? That girl singer who used to be with that all-girl band? ... Belinda Carlisle of the Go-Go's! That's who it was. I played on one of her albums.","The Concert for Bangladesh was just a moral stance.","I've always played around in my own mind with what a Wilburys tour could be. Would each person do a solo set and then do Wilburys at the end, or would we all go on right from beginning to end and make everything Wilburys? It's an intriguing thought.","You've got as many lives as you like, and more, even ones you don't want.","We were the Spice Boys.","I'll play what you want or I won't play at all.","America has everything, why should they want us.","The Beatles will go on and on.","The nicest thing is to open the newspapers and not to find yourself in them.","I'll give up this sort of touring madness certainly, but music-everything is based on music. No, I'll never stop my music.","I play a little guitar, write a few tunes, make a few movies, but none of that's really me. The real me is something else.","I think it was John who really urged me to play sitar on 'Norwegian Wood,' which was the first time we used it. Now, Paul has just asked me recently whether I'd written any more of those 'Indian type of tunes.' He suddenly likes them now. But at the time, he wouldn't play on them.","I'm not a fan of that sort of punky, heavy, tinny stuff. I like a nice melody.","I wasn't Lennon, or I wasn't McCartney. I was me. And the only reason I started to write songs was because I thought, 'Well, if they can write them, I can write them.'","I don't think the Beatles were that good. I think they're fine, you know. Ringo's got the best backbeat I've ever heard... Paul is a fine bass player... but he's a bit overpowering at times.","To tell the truth, I'd join a band with John Lennon any day, but I couldn't join a band with Paul McCartney, but it's nothing personal. It's just from a musical point of view.","They gave their money, and they gave their screams. But the Beatles kind of gave their nervous systems. They used us as an excuse to go mad, the world did, and then blamed it on us.","I'll tell you one thing for sure: once you get to the point where you're actually doing things for truth's sake, then nobody can ever touch you again because you're harmonizing with a greater power.","Of course, once you've been a Beatle, you're never really out of it. People always want to know what you're up to, and if you don't immediately tell 'em, that's when they start making stuff up.","Rap bores me, and all the glamour rock groups like Bon Jovi just amuse me. They obviously have a place, but they all sound like they use the same guitar player to me.","I never listen to the radio to keep up with current trends.","What good are three Beatles without John?","Because we were all from Liverpool, we favored people who were street people.","The fact that we're all here in these bodies means that we're not perfected.","Obviously we were having an effect, because all these people were clamouring to meet us. Like Muhammad Ali, for instance.","It was all part of being a Beatle, really: just getting lugged around and thrust into rooms full of press men taking pictures and asking questions.","Muhammad Ali was quite cute.","We got £25 a week in the early Sixties when we were first with Brian Epstein, when we played the clubs.","In the big picture, it doesn't really matter if we never made a record, or we never sang a song. That isn't important.","I wouldn't say that my songs are autobiographical.","I'm the kind of person who would love to play whenever I felt like, with a band, and it might as well be the Holiday Inn in Nebraska - somewhere where no one knows you, and you're in a band situation just playing music.","The adulation or the superstardom is something I could leave out quite happily."],"George Haven Putnam":["But you say you are conservative - eminently conservative - while we are revolutionary, destructive, or something of the sort. What is conservatism? Is it not adherence to the old and tried, against the new and untried?","Neither let us be slandered from our duty by false accusations against us, nor frightened from it by menaces of destruction to the Government nor of dungeons to ourselves.","John Brown's effort was peculiar. It was not a slave insurrection.","An enthusiast broods over the oppression of a people till he fancies himself commissioned by Heaven to liberate them. He ventures the attempt, which ends in little else than his own execution.","Your purpose, then, plainly stated, is, that you will destroy the Government, unless you be allowed to construe and enforce the Constitution as you please, on all points in dispute between you and us.","We have been so trying to convince them from the very beginning of our organization, but with no success.","Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith, let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it."],"George Henry Lewes":["Originality is independence, not rebellion; it is sincerity, not antagonism.","Insincerity is always weakness; sincerity even in error is strength.","The true function of philosophy is to educate us in the principles of reasoning and not to put an end to further reasoning by the introduction of fixed conclusions.","Many a genius has been slow of growth. Oaks that flourish for a thousand years do not spring up into beauty like a reed.","Personal experience is the basis of all real Literature.","When a man fails to see the truth of certain generally accepted views, there is no law compelling him to provoke animosity by announcing his dissent.","Sincerity is moral truth.","The only cure for grief is action.","Science is the systematic classification of experience.","Language, after all, is only the use of symbols, and Art also can only affect us through symbols.","We must never assume that which is incapable of proof.","All bad Literature rests upon imperfect insight, or upon imitation, which may be defined as seeing at second-hand.","The superiority of one mind over another depends on the rapidity with which experiences are thus organised.","Genius is rarely able to give any account of its own processes.","Speak for yourself and from yourself, or be silent.","Endeavour to be faithful, and if there is any beauty in your thought, your style will be beautiful; if there is any real emotion to express, the expression will be moving.","Literature is at once the cause and the effect of social progress.","Murder, like talent, seems occasionally to run in families.","Books have become our dearest companions, yielding exquisite delights and inspiring lofty aims.","A man may be variously accomplished, and yet be a feeble poet.","The object of Literature is to instruct, to animate, or to amuse.","Science is not addressed to poets.","If you feel yourself to be above the mass, speak so as to raise the mass to the height of your argument.","Good writers are of necessity rare.","Books minister to our knowledge, to our guidance, and to our delight, by their truth, their uprightness, and their art.","All good Literature rests primarily on insight.","Literature delivers tidings of the world within and the world without.","Insight is the first condition of Art.","In complex trains of thought signs are indispensable.","Ordinary men live among marvels and feel no wonder, grow familiar with objects and learn nothing new about them.","All great authors are seers.","Philosophy and Art both render the invisible visible by imagination.","Imagination is not the exclusive appanage of artists, but belongs in varying degrees to all men.","As all Art depends on Vision, so the different kinds of Art depend on the different ways in which minds look at things.","It is unhappily true that much insincere Literature and Art, executed solely with a view to effect, does succeed by deceiving the public.","In all sincere speech there is power, not necessarily great power, but as much as the speaker is capable of.","The delusions of self-love cannot be prevented, but intellectual misconceptions as to the means of achieving success may be corrected.","The public can only be really moved by what is genuine.","No man was ever eloquent by trying to be eloquent, but only by being so.","Sincerity is not only effective and honourable, it is also much less difficult than is commonly supposed."],"George Herbert Mead":["Society is unity in diversity.","To be interested in the public good we must be disinterested, that is, not interested in goods in which our personal selves are wrapped up.","What gives it its human character is that the individual through language addresses himself in the role of the others in the group and thus becomes aware of them in his own conduct.","Imagery is not past but present. It rests with what we call our mental processes to place these images in a temporal order.","The self has the characteristic that it is an object to itself, and that characteristic distinguishes it from other objects and from the body.","No very sharp line can be drawn between social psychology and individual psychology.","The beauty of a face is not a separate quality but a relation or proportion of qualities to each other.","Social psychology is especially interested in the effect which the social group has in the determination of the experience and conduct of the individual member.","To so enter into it in nature and art that the enjoyed meanings of life may become a part of living is the attitude of aesthetic appreciation.","Our cautious ancestors, when yawning, blocked the way to the entrance of evil spirits by putting their hands before their mouths. We find a reason for the gesture in the delicacy of manner which forbids an indecent exposure.","Warfare is an utterly stupid method of settling differences of interest between different nations.","Social psychology has, as a rule, dealt with various phases of social experience from the psychological standpoint of individual experience.","A multiple personality is in a certain sense normal.","Man lives in a world of meaning.","In wartime we identify ourselves with the nation, and its interests are the interests of our primal selves.","Our specious present as such is very short. We do, however, experience passing events; part of the process of the passage of events is directly there in our experience, including some of the past and some of the future.","Take the situation of a scientist solving a problem, where he has certain data, which call for certain responses.

She is truly very special and I adore her.","I'm very strongly in favor of the auteur theory.","I was very inspired by Les Blank's film 'Burden of Dreams.' I think what's unique about his film and the two I've made is that they're close examinations of filmmakers and how their own emotional experiences reflect in the material they're rendering, and vice versa - how that material sometimes colors their own lives.","Generally in my films like 'Hearts of Darkness' or 'Picture This,' I try not to make myself a presence in the film.","There's been a vacuum with movies that people can relate to. There's been a paucity of dramas that people can relate to. I think audiences are clamoring to connect - particularly after 9/11 - with things that are genuine and real and I think documentaries are filling that need.","I love the grandiosity of Hollywood movies, and even in independents, I love the canvas you can tell your story on. I love fiction filmmaking, you really feel like you're creating something.","I think that narrative, fiction filmmaking is the culmination of several art forms: theater, art history, architecture.

I was not.","My father was the orphaned son of immigrants to the United States from Ireland. My father never knew his parents. His mother died - we're not sure - either at or shortly after his birth, and he and all of his siblings were placed in orphanages in the Boston area.","In the spring of 1994 I decided not to seek reelection to the Senate.

I majored in history.","What is good about the United States is the sense that you can disagree with the government and not be seen as unpatriotic, although many in the government will try to make you seem unpatriotic.","The result was, of course, that today, tragically, more than 40 million Americans don't have health insurance, and for many, not having health insurance means they don't have access to good health care.","So my father grew up in an orphanage in Boston. He was then adopted by an elderly childless couple from Maine, who gave him the name of Mitchell. He moved to Maine, and there he met my mother and was married.","So I developed very early a massive inferiority complex, and I've told the story often about how that inspired me later in life to get involved in other things, because I couldn't out-do my brothers in sports, and it's a very competitive relationship.","My parents were very poor, but we never felt any sense of need or want. It was a very close, loving, tightly-knit family growing up, and I never felt any sense of deprivation or anything like that.","My mother was an immigrant from Lebanon to the United States. She came when she was 18 years old in 1920.","In every society in human history, including the United States, those in power seek to imbue themselves with the attributes of religion and patriotism as a way of getting greater support for their policy and insulating themselves from any criticism.","I'm glad I made the decision, although the practice of law - and particularly serving as a federal judge - was a part of my life that I really enjoyed and treasured and look back on it with fondness.","I was the United States Attorney for Maine for three years, and then was appointed a federal judge.","I was born and raised in a small town in Maine, Waterville. I enjoyed living there - still do - and my goal in life was a fairly specific and focused one of practicing law in Maine.","I spent two years in the Army. And my older brother, who was also a great positive influence on me, encouraged me to think about law school, and I said - well, I didn't have any money.","I really owe everything to my parents and their devotion and drive to see to it that their children had the education which led to the opportunities that they never were able to have.","I had been involved in U.S. intelligence in Berlin, Germany, while in the military and had worked with a contact with the Central Intelligence Agency office there.","I got a job with a law firm in Portland after a couple of years with Senator Muskie. But by then, my interest in politics had been sparked, through meeting Senator Muskie, through seeing what he did.","I enjoyed practicing law.","I didn't want to make it a lifetime thing. I don't believe in statutory term limits, but people can limit themselves if they want to, and that's what I decided to do.","From my parents, I learned a very strong work ethic, and all of my brothers and sisters all worked from the earliest days of life right through to the present time.","First, the American legislative process isn't well suited to large and complex measures.","As they say, one thing led to another, and, ultimately, the British and Irish governments asked me to serve as chairman of the peace negotiations, which ironically began six years ago this week.","And I spent that time working as an insurance adjuster and going to law school in the evening, and then when I left law school, I joined the Department of Justice in Washington."],"George Jackson":["Patience has its limits.

Art is the sex of the imagination.","Criticism is the art of appraising others at one's own value.","An actor without a playwright is like a hole without a doughnut.","A man admires a woman not for what she says, but what she listens to.","It is only the cynicism that is born of success that is penetrating and valid.","Whenever a man encounters a woman in a mood he doesn't understand, he wants to know if she's tired.","I have yet to find a man worth his salt in any direction who did not think of himself first and foremost.","Women, as they grow older, rely more and more on cosmetics. Men, as they grow older, rely more and more on a sense of humor."],"George Jessel":["The human brain is a wonderful organ. It starts to work as soon as you are born and doesn't stop until you get up to deliver a speech.","The human brain starts working the moment you are born and never stops until you stand up to speak in public.","Marriage is a mistake every man should make.","This case reminds me of one in which I likened the Plaintiff's case to a colander, because it was so full of holes."],"George Jones":["I miss all of my old friends who have passed away. Sometimes you just don't understand why they were taken so soon. I loved and miss Johnny Cash. I miss my old buddy Johnny Paycheck, who happens to be buried in an area of the cemetery that I bought for my family.","My mama loved me more than anybody ever did.","I was born in Saratoga, Texas, a little town there in the Big Thicket about 60 miles north of Beaumont. Needless to say, we were very, very poor, but we always managed to have enough to keep our bellies full.","I loved Roy Acuff with all my heart, and I never dreamed I'd be able to meet him or see him onstage, or especially become good friends with him. For all this to happen, it's hard to explain what a dream this is when you love something as much as I love traditional country music.","We'd just go to church and sing. My dad would get me and my sister Doris, and we would sing together. I sung the harmony, and my sister Doris took the lead.","There's nothing prettier in the world than a melody. I can get lost in a song with a melody. A lot of times I have, and the song wasn't that good, but I would get lost in that melody, and I'd want to do the song.","Country fans need to support country music by buying albums and concert tickets for traditional artists or the music will just fade away. And that would be really sad.","I just wanted to sing, in church or wherever.","I tried to be a house painter, but I couldn't stand all that paint all over me.","After the first couple of years recording, I did a lot of praying. I said, 'Lord, please give me a hit.' I want one so bad.","The only music we ever listened to out in the piney woods was Roy Acuff and the Grand Ole Opry. That was the only night of the week I was allowed to lay in the middle of the bed with Mama and Daddy, just long enough to hear Roy Acuff sing; then I had to go back to bed.","Roy Acuff was a big hero for me, and I was so sad when he passed. It's hard as you get older to lose your friends and family.","When you don't act right to your family and friends, that's bad, but they also have the opportunity to experience the 'good' side as well. Disappointing the fans is an entirely different thing because the fans love your music and save up money to see you in concert.","There were a lot of songs during my MCA years that I thought should have been singles but were not. You can't worry about what wasn't - I was very lucky to have as many hits as I had.","There was no such thing as production at Starday. We'd go in with the band, we'd go over the song, I'd look over and tell the steel player to take a break or kick it off, and I'd get the fiddle to play a turnaround in the middle."],"George Kaiser":["Naming rights are a seductive philanthropic inducement, yet more anonymous operational support may better advance the charitable purpose.","Truly, learning appears to be a reverse geometric progression with experiences at one hour, one day, one month or one year dramatically more influential and formative than later experiences. As has often been quoted, 85% of brain development takes place by age 3, and yet we spend only 4% of our educational dollars by that point.","Those who have won the ovarian lottery by being born in an advanced society to loving parents have a special obligation to help restore the American Dream.","America's 'social contract' is equal opportunity... yet we have failed in achieving that seminal goal.","Rich, smart parents tend to have rich, smart kids - not because it's genetic but because they can create a home environment and sensory stimulation that lower-income kids often don't get.","If you are born into poverty, the chances are good that your children will be born into poverty. Find a way to give poor kids the same cognitive stimulus that rich kids receive, and they should end up with the same tools for success.","In the charitable world as in the business world, opportunities should drive budgets, not the other way around.","During the desperate depression of the 1980s, there were no oil and gas companies without net operating losses.","I suppose I arrived at my charitable commitment largely through guilt. I recognized early on that my good fortune was not due to superior personal character or initiative so much as it was to dumb luck.","I prefer doing things rather than sitting around talking about doing things.","If you are doing what everyone else is doing, there is probably not an opportunity there.","Maybe the perceived fact that smart, rich parents tended to have smart, rich kids was largely due to the fact that they also tended to have stay-at-home moms or nannies who read to their kids, held them, put mobiles over their cribs, playing those annoying ditties, and sent them off for SAT training at six months."],"George Karl":["The great player, so much of the greatness, in my mind, is in his heart and his head. It's not in his body, in his skill set. It comes from having great talent but wanting to mold that and fit it together into being special. And being special means winning championships.","Coaches don't sleep for a reason. They don't sleep because it's a danger zone every night. Very seldom do you ever get two or three days off... The lifestyle of coaching in the NBA is a tremendous challenge that gives you tremendous highs but also tremendous lows.","You always spend a little more time watching the guys you coached, to see how they're playing. And there's no question that when I check scores, I still go to the Nuggets scorer faster than any other scores. I have a lot of love for the players and a lot of love for the city.","Who is the ally of the coach? Who's going to write, 'Man, that was a well-coached game.' Players win, coaches lose.","I want to try to prove the world wrong - that you can run and win in the NBA, and you can win big if you keep running. The problem is, can you run for 82 games every minute, every possession of every game?","In the NBA, you win, and you think you're going to win tomorrow. But as soon as you lose, you don't think you're ever going to win again.","There should not be an entitlement that because you get paid the most money, that you should finish every game. But if you don't do it, then the agents are going to call, and the players are going to mope, and so you negotiate that. It's a compromise as a coach.","In coaching, you don't ever really have that joyful fun, but there's no question that it's enjoyable.","The truth of basketball is done in competition and fundamentals and team, but there's a lot of other junk that goes around the game.","I think we, as pro coaches, should have a consciousness towards having an image and a role model mentality for kids.","I truthfully think, a consistent coach over 30 years, probably, I'd rather be that than having one championship and mediocrity for years.","I kind of lived by the code of 'I'm going to be a hard-working guy.' And no matter how successful, there is something I can do better. That's kind of the drive I live on.","I want to be the team that creates the action more than be the reactor.","One thing I'll tell you is the food in Sacramento is off the charts. You've got good Asian food, the farm system where everything is natural, which I believe in. I like organic.","The best player I ever coached was Gary Payton."],"George Kell":["Never let yourself get fooled by the same pitcher on the same pitch on the same day.","I always could hit, but fielding I had to work at. I took as much pride in fielding as hitting. I became a complete ballplayer. I knew when to take the extra base. I knew about the outfielder hitting the cutoff man. I knew when and how to bunt. I knew when to hit-and-run.","I don't know anybody else who lives 1,000 miles away from their job and gets to commute back and forth. The owner said, 'You can live in your beloved Swifton, but don't you dare miss a game.' I had a few close calls, but I didn't miss any.","Changes your life, getting into the Hall of Fame. For the rest of my life, I'll be known as Hall of Famer George Kell.","It was much more fun playing with him than against him. If you wanted one pitcher to start the seventh game of the World Series, which he did in 1945, you'd pick Hal Newhouser."],"George Kennedy":["Of course, I also attribute some of my hearing loss to being in the infantry in World War II. It's probably a combination of heredity and noise exposure.","When you think of a movie, most people imagine a two hour finished, polished product. But to get to that two hour product, it can take hundreds or thousands of people many months of full time work.","My father died when I was 4 years old, so I can't really say anything about his hearing.","I have been so fortunate and I really am appreciative of the success I've had.","I had the good fortune of speaking with Orson Wells many decades ago and he said 'Success is primarily luck anyway.' And I have been very lucky. Of course, Orson Wells was enormously talented and brilliant - so who am I to argue with him!"],"George Konrad":["You take a number of small steps which you believe are right, thinking maybe tomorrow somebody will treat this as a dangerous provocation. And then you wait. If there is no reaction, you take another step: courage is only an accumulation of small steps.","I believe that it is my job not only to write books but to have them published. A book is like a child. You have to defend the life of a child."],"George Kotsiopoulos":["Winter dressing is all about having chic outerwear.","Photos convey a point in time, so for casual snapshots I say wear the trends so you have fun images to look back at.","I learned everything about fashion during my time at the 'NY Times.'","For many years I've been using Swarovski accessories when styling editorial photo shoots and also for red carpet appearances.","For slaves to fashion, the rules are made to be broken.","The weight of a fabric is inconsequential, since seasonal dressing is all about layering.","I like to spend Christmas with family and friends, pigging out, exchanging gifts and basically doing nothing.","For proper family portraits it's best to stick with classic, timeless looks that will not only be beautiful now but also in 20 years, and keep the wardrobe color palette similar so it looks like the group shot was well planned.","It's better if you have a strong opinion on any talk show.","You know what I've kind of come to realize is that I'm a huge Drew Barrymore rom-com fan. There are so many of her movies that I love."],"George Lazenby":["Fame is short-lived, and you're the last to know when you are no longer hot."],"George Leigh Mallory":["The first question which you will ask and which I must try to answer is this; What is the use of climbing Mount Everest? and my answer must at once be, it is no use. There is not the slightest prospect of any gain whatsoever.","What we get from this adventure is just sheer joy. And joy is, after all, the end of life. We do not live to eat and make money.","The highest of the world's mountains, it seems, has to make but a single gesture of magnificence to be the lord of all, vast in unchallenged and isolated supremacy.","We will stomp to the top with the wind in our teeth."],"George Leonard":["Competition is the spice of sports; but if you make spice the whole meal you'll be sick.","The ultimate creative capacity of the brain may be, for all practical purposes, infinite."],"George Lindsey":["It's not hard to tell we was poor - when you saw the toilet paper dryin' on the clothesline.","I was too dumb to know Opie was going to grow up to be a great Director, if so, boy, I would certainly have become his best friend.","It takes 10 million failures to find the right stuff.","It's good to be funny when you are a comedian."],"George Linnaeus Banks":["I live to hail that season by gifted one foretold, when men shall live by reason, and not alone by gold.","For the cause that lacks assistance, the wrong that needs resistance, for the future in the distance, and the good that I can do.","I live for those who love me, for those who know me true, for the heaven so blue above me, and the good that I can do."],"George Lloyd":["The ancient Greeks have a knack of wrapping truths in myths.","When I'm old I shall give up writing the big stuff and shall wander round the park thinking of songs."],"George Lois":["Because advertising and marketing is an art, the solution to each new problem or challenge should begin with a blank canvas and an open mind, not with the nervous borrowings of other people's mediocrities. That's precisely what 'trends' are - a search for something 'safe' - and why a reliance on them leads to oblivion.","I look in the mirror, and I work with the brightest person I know.","Great advertising, in and of itself, becomes a benefit of the product.","To me, great advertising can make food taste better, can make your car run smoother. It can change your perception of something. Is it wrong to change your perception about something? Of course not. I'm not lying; I'm just saying, 'This one's more fun, this one's more exciting.'","The creative act, the defeat of habit by originality, overcomes everything. And I really believe that. And what I try to teach young people, or anybody in any creative field, is that every idea should seemingly be outrageous.","Museums are custodians of epiphanies, and these epiphanies enter the central nervous system and deep recesses of the mind.","What I taught myself was that in any problem you get, you've got to come up with an innovative, brilliant, kind of unusual, stunning solution.","Nobody should force you to do a bad piece of work in your whole life - no client, no creative director, nobody. The job isn't to please the client; the job is to produce something for the client that makes them incredibly successful.","If you work with convictions, people have got to listen to you.","My concern has always been with creating images that catch people's eyes, penetrate their minds, warm their hearts and cause them to act.","I don't design. I get what I think is a big idea, and I put the idea down. I'm not a designer. I'm a communicator.","Truly great images make all the other millions of images you look at unimportant. You gotta look at an image and understand it in a nanosecond.","When you think of a brand, you should immediately understand it from the advertising attitude, from the words and visuals.","When I lecture kids, I say, 'You've got to be ambitious by the advertising' - ambitious. You've got to say, 'See, this product? Maybe I can change the world with this product.' They look at me like I'm nuts, but that's what you can do.","In professional work - certainly in the arts and graphics - 99% of people have zero courage. They blow with the wind.","I had a fistfight with every kid on my block. I got about fifteen broken noses to prove it. Part of it was also because I was always drawing, and I always had an artist portfolio with me. But I was a tough kid. I won their respect.","Doyle Dane Bernbach was a great, great agency when I got there. There was an arrogance that everyone had, but it was a closed club. I was a guy who worked a little differently. Edgier. More punch-in-the-mouth.","If somebody says to you, 'MTV,' you think of Mick Jagger on a phone screaming at that phone: 'I want my MTV.' That, to me, was always the epitome of great advertising.","From the time I was three or four years old, I drew all the time. Drew all the time, every second.","The producers of 'Mad Men,' you know, think I hate their show, which is true.","Look at the news stand, you know? I mean, it's a cacophony of famous people or people who want to be famous with blurbs all around it, and it's supposed to be, you know, that's supposed to be creativity in journalism. My God, it's unbelievable. It's shocking.","A graphic designer, you know, who understands ideas and understands that ideas are what makes the world go round, could change the world with a magazine. If one talent could do it right now, and everybody would stop saying it's the death of magazines.","There's no such thing as a cautious creative.","I've done truth to power all my life. It's got me into trouble, but who cares?","Nothing great can come of more than three people in a room. If you had 10 incredibly bright people, nothing would come out of it.","If you're working, and you're not trying to be great, give up.","I talk to all the creative directors today, and they take me aside, and they say, 'You know, it must have been great back in those days when you could do anything you wanted.' I say, 'Huh? Excuse me?' I mean, we fought. In the '60s and '70s, you fought wars with clients, and you have to continue fighting wars to do great work.","Everybody is so busy talking about 'Twittering' and talking about the new technologies and talking about this and that, but they don't talk about creativity.","When you create advertising, always start with the words.","All the people who run agencies, all the important people in agencies have taken communication courses, marketing courses, advertising courses, and courses basically teach advertising as a science, and advertising is so far from a science it isn't even funny. Advertising is an art.","The whole area of creativity is constipated and frightened.","Trends can tyrannize; trends are traps. In any creative industry, the fact that others are moving in a certain direction is always proof positive, at least to me, that a new direction is the only direction.","Whatever the creative industry, when you're confronted with the challenge of coming up with a Big Idea, always work with the most talented, innovative mind available. Hopefully... that's you.","Sometimes all the 'marketing' insight in the world can't move a client, but the creation of a truly great brand name can become a billion-dollar idea!","When I teach classes at the School of Visual Arts,, I'll ask the students, 'How many of you have been to a museum this year?' Nobody raises their hand and I go into a tirade. If you want to do something sharp and innovative, you have to know what went on before.","Ad agencies do all kinds of market research that ask people what they think they want, and instead, you should be creating things that you want. If you do something and you get it, the rest of the world will get it, too. Trust your own instincts, your own intellect, and your own sense of humor.","With the way I worked, a client can give me everything they know about something, and then I go away and come back with advertising that knocks them out of their chair. They finally understand what kind of a company they are.","You can't test great advertising. You can only test the mediocre. Not that I don't care about demographics. You have to understand who you're going after.","The computer has played a role in destroying creativity with the Photoshop. Everybody thinks they're a designer.","People say I'm the original Don Draper. I'm not Don Draper.","The 1960s was a heroic age in the history of the art of communication - the audacious movers and shakers of those times bear no resemblance to the cast of characters in 'Mad Men.'","What Apple did for technology is brilliant, but they didn't do nothin' for our economy.","These days, no celebrity on a magazine cover, including Brad Pitt, Oprah Winfrey, Julia Roberts, or Leonardo DiCaprio, could possibly match the visual punch of Alfred E. Neuman, the gap-toothed, grinning boy, goofily peeking out at us on the newsstand.","A truly great magazine cover surprises, even shocks, and connects in a nano-second.","You don't create a magazine for your readers. You don't take a poll, you know, like the politicians do, and find out what they're thinking and what they want... You're supposed to be telling people what the hell you think is exciting and dynamic and thought-provoking, and do it - and do it your way.","'Mad Men' is nothing more than the fulfillment of every possible stereotype of the early 1960s bundled up nicely to convince consumers that the sort of morally repugnant behavior exhibited by its characters - with one-night-stands and excessive consumption of Cutty Sark and Lucky Strikes - is glamorous and 'vintage.'","It's almost as if creativity is dead. The visual power of advertising was everywhere - now it's basically gone.","If you think people are dumb, you'll spend a lifetime doing dumb work.","When I did 'Esquire,' I did a lot of celebrity covers, but the celebrity cover was Hubert Humphrey as a dummy, sitting on Lyndon Johnson's lap and aping his feelings about the war. I did celebrity covers that made a difference in what was going on in American culture.","I may have destroyed world culture, but MTV wouldn't exist today if it wasn't for me.","I'm sounding like an old fart talking about how bad advertising is today, but it's true. Advertising sucks. Guys like me and Bob Gage and certainly Bill Bernbach and two or three other guys, we exemplified and led the creative revolution."],"George Lopez":["When things are bad, it's the best time to reinvent yourself.","If this country wants to elect someone with no political experience who is racially insensitive and golfs... In my first 100 days, I will make Taco Tuesday the law.","In life, there's a ying and a yang and a balance. And when you don't have balance, you have comedy.","I didn't want to be nobody, and that was the only way I could be somebody was to do stand-up.","The thing that upsets me the most is the entitlement of people that will stand with a flag and say to some other people that they need to go back to where they came from. When, in fact, they also would need to go back to where they came from, because you need to go all the way back to the beginning.","So I started to relax and would work on my act eight hours a day, sitting at a desk writing at my grandmother's house, and I would put on Richard Pryor Live on Long Beach and would play it like a loop and think and write.","I love comedy and I would write things to myself as an exercise in writing. I didn't do well for years, and I quit. I started to break down why I was afraid and started to look at people I admired, like Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy, Freddie Prinze, George Carlin and all.","I believe that there are certain things that could be taken care of that you don't need a strong political background in.","I had a very difficult childhood. I was surrounded by people who had both parents, which made me feel different. Having a bit of a rougher existence early on, it made me appreciate the work ethic that my grandparents instilled in me.","It was June 4, 1979, the first time I went on stage. I didn't know I could do it but I knew I couldn't not do it. I quit everything in my life and this was the one thing I couldn't quit.","It's not even about black and white anymore, because so many people are from mixed backgrounds and mixed ethnicities, and it's just a great time to be able to pull all that together.","It's a great day in America when white people, black people and Latinos can all come together and pick on another minority.","The first night was awful because I was so afraid, and I was never more afraid because it was going out of my character to be outgoing and to be vulnerable and to be out there and onstage. My hands were sweaty and I couldn't swallow, and I drank a bottle of wine to calm my nerves.","I can't pay her back, but what I can do is make her as happy as she thought I would when we first got married.","I never realized I could love people as much as I do now.","If the worst thing that can happen is that nobody laughs, then I can deal with that, because the worst thing that can happen at the factory is that I could lose a limb or be crushed by a huge machine.","David Letterman is the best late-night talk show host right now, hands down, and has been since he first took the desk.","Freddie Prinze was my idol, and he died, and there is not much of his stuff to look at. But now, your comedy can live on forever.","When you go to cable, there are no stations and no affiliates and they allow you to do your show.","I didn't come from a background where I saw a lot of loving couples. All my aunts and uncles were either split up or fighting all the time. The only healthy relationships I saw were on TV.","When I look at the Gospel, I see how it is speaking to me at this time. I see how to be to others and it helps.","I've spent days in cinemas answering questions from the audience, in interviews, travelling abroad, and all they do is thank me nicely.","Whoever is my relative, I will not be nice to them.","I don't know if the art of stand-up will survive. Stand-up seems dated. Now you can do a mini-movie or a short with a beginning, middle, and end. A guy standing there seems a little old - especially when you can go on the Internet and see 'Funny or Die.'","Everything will be seen on your computer or BlackBerry or whatever devices we will be seeing in the future. Comedians will put their content on whatever server and send it to you specifically. We may even lose the live performance."],"George Lucas":["You simply have to put one foot in front of the other and keep going. Put blinders on and plow right ahead.","The secret is not to give up hope. It's very hard not to because if you're really doing something worthwhile I think you will be pushed to the brink of hopelessness before you come through the other side.","Everybody has talent, it's just a matter of moving around until you've discovered what it is.","The sound and music are 50% of the entertainment in a movie.","The story being told in 'Star Wars' is a classic one. Every few hundred years, the story is retold because we have a tendency to do the same things over and over again. Power corrupts, and when you're in charge, you start doing things that you think are right, but they're actually not.","I live a reasonably simple life, off the beaten track.","Working hard is very important. You're not going to get anywhere without working extremely hard.","For 'Star Wars' I had to develop a whole new idea about special effects to give it the kind of kinetic energy I was looking for. I did it with motion-control photography.","You can't do it unless you can imagine it.","Good luck has its storms.","The secret to the movie business, or any business, is to get a good education in a subject besides film - whether it's history, psychology, economics, or architecture - so you have something to make a movie about. All the skill in the world isn't going to help you unless you have something to say.","I'm not much of a math and science guy. I spent most of my time in school daydreaming and managed to turn it into a living.","The secret to film is that it's an illusion.","'Star Wars' is fun, its exciting, its inspirational, and people respond to that. It's what they want.","I am simply trying to struggle through life; trying to do God's bidding.","A director makes 100 decisions an hour. Students ask me how you know how to make the right decision, and I say to them, 'If you don't know how to make the right decision, you're not a director.'","If the boy and girl walk off into the sunset hand-in-hand in the last scene, it adds 10 million to the box office.","Before I became a film major, I was very heavily into social science, I had done a lot of sociology, anthropology, and I was playing in what I call social psychology, which is sort of an offshoot of anthropology/sociology - looking at a culture as a living organism, why it does what it does.","Part of the issue of achievement is to be able to set realistic goals, but that's one of the hardest things to do because you don't always know exactly where you're going, and you shouldn't.","I thought Star Wars was too wacky for the general public.","The technology keeps moving forward, which makes it easier for the artists to tell their stories and paint the pictures they want.","There should be a point to movies. Sure, you're giving people a diversion from the cold world for a bit, but at the same time, you pass on some facts and rules and maybe a little bit of wisdom.","Storytelling is about two things; it's about character and plot.","I've come to the conclusion that mythology is really a form of archaeological psychology. Mythology gives you a sense of what a people believes, what they fear.","Digital technology allows us a much larger scope to tell stories that were pretty much the grounds of the literary media.","One thing about 'Star Wars' that I'm really proud of is that it expands the imagination. That's why I like the 'Star Wars' toys.","I started out in anthropology, so to me how society works, how people put themselves together and make things work, has always been a big interest.","I wanted to race cars. I didn't like school, and all I wanted to do was work on cars. But right before I graduated, I got into a really bad car accident, and I spent that summer in the hospital thinking about where I was heading. I decided to take education more seriously and go to a community college.","When you are a beginning film maker you are desperate to survive. The most important thing in the end is survival and being able to get to your next picture.","Football games are on TV, and it doesn't affect stadium attendance at all. It's the same with movies. People who really love movies and like to go out on a Saturday night will go to the movie theater.","None of the films I've done was designed for a mass audience, except for 'Indiana Jones.' Nobody in their right mind thought 'American Graffiti' or 'Star Wars' would work.","The influence of 'Hidden Fortress' comes up a lot because it was printed in a book once. The truth is, the only thing I was inspired by was the fact that it's told from the point of view of two peasants, who get mixed up with a samurai and princess and a lot of very high-level people.","When I was making 'Star Wars,' I wasn't restrained by any kind of science. I simply said, 'I'm going to create a world that's fun and interesting, makes sense, and seems to have a reality to it.'","I was afraid that science-fiction buffs and everybody would say things like, 'You know, there's no sound in outer space.'","Although I write screenplays, I don't think I'm a very good writer.","I was going to go to a four-year college and be an anthropologist or to an art school and be an illustrator when a friend convinced me to learn photography at the University of Southern California. Little did I know it was a school that taught you how to make movies! It had never occurred to me that I'd ever have any interest in filmmaking.","The way I define 'intelligent design' is that when people started out, we wanted to make sense of the world we lived in, so we created stories about how things worked.","I loved photography and everybody said it was a crazy thing to do because in those days nobody made it into the film business. I mean, unless you were related to somebody there was no way in.","I am a giant proponent of giant screens. But I accept the fact that most of my movies are going to be seen on phones.","Digital technology is the same revolution as adding sound to pictures and the same revolution as adding color to pictures. Nothing more and nothing less.","A special effect is a tool, a means of telling a story. A special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing.","Learning to make films is very easy. Learning what to make films about is very hard.","Film is not an easy occupation. There's a lot of occupations that are difficult and film is one of them.","If you really love films, and you really want to get the full impact, there's a huge difference between watching something on a small screen with a mediocre sound system and watching it on a giant screen in a giant theater with a huge beautiful sound system. I mean, the difference is electric.","I've always been a follower of silent movies. I see film as a visual medium with a musical accompaniment, and dialogue is a raft that goes on with it.","I'm one of those people who says, 'yes, cinema died when they invented sound.'","'American Graffiti' was unpleasant because of the fact that there was no money, no time, and I was compromising myself to death.","A film is sort of binary - it either works or it doesn't work. It has nothing to do with how good a job you do. If you bring it up to an adequate level where the audience goes with the movie, then it works, that is all.","Everyone seems to think that digital technology devoids the medium of content, but that is not true at all. If anything, it broadens the content.","Even in high school I was very interested in history - why people do the things they do. As a kid I spent a lot of time trying to relate the past to the present.","A lot of people like to do certain things, but they're not that good at it. Keep going through the things that you like to do, until you find something that you actually seem to be extremely good at. It can be anything.","Whatever has happened in my quest for innovation has been part of my quest for immaculate reality.","The ideals and principles for which Dr King fought have never been forgotten and are as relevant today as they were 40 years ago.","To be renewed is everything. What more could one ask for than to have one's youth back again?","Making a film is like putting out a fire with sieve. There are so many elements, and it gets so complicated.","There wasn't much as a kid that inspired me in what I did as an adult, but I was always very interested in what motivates people, and in telling stories and building things.","It's hard work making movies. It's like being a doctor: you work long hours, very hard hours, and it's emotional, tense work. If you don't really love it, then it ain't worth it.","Changes are not unusual - I mean, most movies, when they release them, they make changes. But somehow, when I make the slightest change, everybody thinks it's the end of the world.","If you look at 'Blade Runner,' it's been cut sixteen ways from Sunday, and there are all kinds of different versions of it.","It was the money from 'Star Wars' and 'Jaws' that allowed the theaters to build their multiplexes, which allowed an opening up of screens.","All art is dependent on technology because it's a human endeavour, so even when you're using charcoal on a wall or designed the proscenium arch, that's technology.","There's no difference between movies and television. None at all. Except in a lot of cases, television's much better than movies.","I grew up in San Francisco. And so I'm informed in a certain kind of way about, you know, believing in democracy and believing in America. And I'm a very ardent patriot.","I've never been that much of a money guy. I'm more of a film guy, and most of the money I've made is in defense of trying to keep creative control of my movies.","'Young Indiana Jones' was one of the happiest times I ever had, so I love television.","Film is a very tight little box. If you don't fit in that box, you're gone. Television, there's more room to move around.","I realized why directors are such horrible people - in a way - because you want things to be right, and people will just not listen to you, and there is no time to be nice to people, no time to be delicate.","In 3-D filmmaking, I can take images and manipulate them infinitely, as opposed to taking still photographs and laying them one after the other. I move things in all directions. It's such a liberating experience.","One of the amazing things about 'Seven Samurai' is that there are a lot of characters. And considering you have so many, and they all have shaved heads, and you've got good guys and bad guys and peasants, you get to understand a lot of them without too much being said.","Whenever you do something, people try to re-do it and do a better version, especially if they're in another country.","As a Western, 'The Magnificent Seven' was a pretty good film. I don't think it was as interesting or as multi-faceted as 'Seven Samurai.'","I was never interested in being powerful or famous. But once I got to film school and learned about movies, I just fell in love with it. I didn't care what kind of movies I made."],"George M. Church":["At some point, someone will come up with an airtight argument as to why they should have a cloned child. At that point, cloning will be acceptable.","The rewards for biotechnology are tremendous - to solve disease, eliminate poverty, age gracefully. It sounds so much cooler than Facebook.","If we go into space, we need enhancements that handle radiation and osteoporosis... or else we're dead. So what seems like an enhancement in one generation becomes life and death in another generation.","Your genetics is not your destiny.","The goal of getting your genome done is not to tell you what you will die from, but it's how to learn how to take action to prevent disease.","Making new petroleum should be as simple and straightforward as brewing beer.","You can't just hoard your ideas inside the ivory tower. You have to get them out into the world.","Most people are excited about themselves. Personal genome will deliver for inexpensively something about science to which you can relate. Just like computers are becoming something to which you can relate. It should be even easier to relate to your own biology, and I hope that will be one of the ways we get broader literacy in science.","If you get very fine, accurate, and inexpensive control over your genome, you can fundamentally change the kind of organism you are. You are extending human capacity.","Trees are essentially growing chairs. There are lots of primates that sit and sleep in them.","Every cell in our body, whether it's a bacterial cell or a human cell, has a genome. You can extract that genome - it's kind of like a linear tape - and you can read it by a variety of methods. Similarly, like a string of letters that you can read, you can also change it. You can write, you can edit it, and then you can put it back in the cell.","What dinosaur traits are missing from an ostrich? The ostrich has a toothless beak, but there are mutations that cause teeth and claws to come back to their mouth and limbs. You need to replace the feathers with scales, but there are no feathers on their legs and feet, so you just need to make its whole body like its legs are.","A scenario is, everyone takes gene therapy - not just curing rare diseases like cystic fibrosis, but diseases that everyone has, like aging.","A few dozen changes to the genome of a modern elephant - to give it subcutaneous fat, woolly hair and sebaceous glands - might suffice to create a variation that is functionally similar to the mammoth. Returning this keystone species to the tundras could stave off some effects of warming.","There's this very interesting and complicated connection between our environment and our genes and the traits that come out of the environment plus genes. And there's huge potential. I mean we see amazing abilities. Marie Curie, Albert Einstein. All sorts of arts, and literature and so forth. These are not typical traits of everybody on earth.","I like to keep the median age in my lab low because they will indulge me in my dreams. They don't yet think things are impossible.","Terrorism is not a public health threat, relative to cancer and heart disease and malaria and so forth.","I think my original inspiration came from just natural curiosity about science and math and biology. In particular, I would say that, as I matured, it became more a feeling of trying to avoid the waste that occurs in the world where we have 6.5 billion minds. If you're a computer scientist, you can think of them as supercomputers.","Preventing ongoing extinction of elephants, rhinoceroses, and other threatened species is critically important. By all means, we must set priorities for allocating finite conservation resources.","The best way to predict the future is to change it.","You should have personalized genomics, personalized physiology, personalized medicine, where each person's different, and each body is an integrated whole.","If society becomes comfortable with cloning and sees value in true human diversity, then the whole Neanderthal creature itself could be cloned by a surrogate mother chimp - or by an extremely adventurous female human.","The World Wide Web went from zero to millions of web pages in a few years. Many revolutions look irrelevant just before they change everything swiftly.","It's all too easy to dismiss the future. People confuse what's impossible today with what's impossible tomorrow.","I'll drop something for a while, a year or maybe several years, and then pick it up again. I think that's the way successful innovators work. They keep juggling ideas, keeping them in the air, in the back of their mind, to inspire them or enable new recombinations.","Very often, as I wander through life, I'll get that old feeling that I've come back from the future, and I'm living in the past. And it's a really horrible feeling.","I like talking and walking. It's more productive than doing just one.","People think it's great to be ahead of your time, but it can actually be quite painful.","I always loved computers - it's something inside you.","I'm pathologically calm.","We might want to figure out what are the positive effects of autism - mild cases.","Science has very definite faith components, and most religions don't stick to faith. They venture out into making predictions about our physical world. They don't just say there's something that is completely unconnected to us. They say actually it affects a lot. And when they do that, they merge.","We know that there is a connection between our feelings and our brain.","There's a lot of faith expressed by scientists about science. It's kind of an act of faith that science is a good thing. We don't know that for sure. We may not know that millions of years from now.","Clearly, we are a species that is well connected to other species. Whether or not we evolve from them, we are certainly very closely related to them. A series of mutations could change us into all kinds of intermediate species. Whether or not those intermediate species are provably in the past, they could easily be in our future.","We have the ability to completely change our environment to go... to take on... to inherit, in a certain sense, things far beyond our DNA, and that's inheritable. And we can see evolution in action as our ideas evolve and undergo a kind of Darwinian selection not at the DNA level. And we can go off into space.","If you get a personal genome, you should be able to get personal cell lines, stem cell derived from your adult tissues, that allow you to bring together synthetic biology and the sequencing so that you can repair parts of your body as you age or repair things that were inherited disorders.","We went from a world where almost nobody knew anything about computers to a world where almost all of us are computer geeks for a huge fraction of our day. And I'd like to see that happen with the digital world of biological molecules, too.","In my lab, we are constantly asking, 'What's the utility of this pure science that we're doing? Let's nudge it a little bit in a direction where people can connect to it and have some fun and/or help some very serious problems they have.'","When something like personal genomics or synthetic biology suddenly appears - it seems to suddenly appear - we might have been working on it for 30 years, but it seems to come out of nowhere. Then you need strategies for engaging a lot of people and thinking about where it will be going in the next few months or few years.","I think something very simple that everybody can do is they can participate in medical research as subjects. Personal genome project, for example, will take on as many subjects as we can find.","It sounds a little bit too arrogant, but I think I certainly have a working model for how I conduct my life, and it may or may not be a correct worldview.","We have a love affair with the idea of the 'natural,' even though we, as a species, are about as unnatural as you can imagine.","My laboratory and my obsession is about safety and building/engineering safety. It's not just a matter of saying we want the world to be safer; we have to create technology.","I will make the argument that we are poorly adapted to our current environment. I mean, we did not evolve to sit all day and be exposed to giant amounts of really tasty food.","We will have to make a decision, as we go into new environments outside of earth, whether we want to drag along with us all our pathogens. We can, or we can't - it's up to us - but I consider that part of genome engineering is how we interact with the huge part of our genome which is our microbiome.","What I really wanted was for everybody to have their genome and, ideally, everybody to share their genome, and for that, we needed to bring the price way down.","Reversal of ageing is high on my list of things to do, and not just because I'm getting old.","If we can come up with a way of backing up my brain into another that I have in my back-pack, we'll do it. People talk themselves out of things very easily. Things that they think are a million years away, or never, are actually four years away.","The goal of reanimation research is not to make perfect living copies of extinct organisms, nor is it meant to be a one-off stunt in a laboratory or zoo. Reanimation is about leveraging the best of ancient and synthetic DNA.","Aside from bringing back extinct species, reanimation could help living ones by restoring lost genetic diversity. The Tasmanian devil (aka Sarcophilus harrisii) is so inbred at this point that most species members can exchange tumor cells without rejection.","I don't actually believe there's any such thing as privacy.","Why would you not have a robot that looks like Abraham Lincoln? Why would it look like an erector set? Why use a computer with a punchcard, when you could use one with a touch pen on the screen? Why a car, when you could use a jetpack?","Letting the tundra melt is the equivalent to burning all of the forests in all of the world and their roots two and a half times over.","Our ancestors didn't need any genetic enhancements to be able to sit for twelve hours a day and eat fatty, sugary foods, but we need enhancements that handle that altered environment.","I would argue that we're not limited by actual DNA. You can re-create the ancient DNA by looking at the genomes of existing animals.","Reversal is something that has been demonstrated in a number of different animals in a number of different ways. I think that's going to translate into larger animals and humans. We won't know until we try. But we are trying 65 different genes in different combinations to see if we can reproduce the aging reversal that we've seen in small animals.","If we could take one of my skin cells and turn it into an embryo-like cell and turn it back into a skin cell, it has reset almost all of the developmental indications of age.","I don't think it is about stalling or curing: it's about reversing. Curing gives you the impression of immortality. Stalling gives you the impression that you'll be 85 forever, which is not great.","I'm a champion for personal differences. I have no sympathy for drug companies that can't figure out how to make personalized medicine. We could generalize that to 'All society should be much more personalized.'","Anytime you see somebody keeping a secret, that's symptomatic that something's wrong with the society around them. That means there's discrimination or worse.","There are a few genetic traits that make people feel sorry for you, and there are some, like narcolepsy, at which people take personal offense unless you tell them in advance.","As part of our dedication to safety engineering in biology, we're trying to get better at creating physically contained test systems to develop something that eventually will be so biologically contained that we won't need physical containment anymore.","Most groups patent ways of using genetic discoveries as part of non-obvious diagnostic and therapeutic protocols and slightly or greatly altered genes.","You can make pigs that are essentially much closer to being universal donors. If it works, their organs will be going into people like you and me.","How do you get things out of your head, out of your lab, and into the world? If you're not part of the economic community, there's a chance... you'll fall behind.","I have a rule against saying something is impossible unless it violates laws of physics.","Genomics is a new idea. Like the PC, it's not obvious at first that anyone would want one. It's like, 'Hey, we've already got one genome, why do we need more?'","Someone younger at heart should replace you, and that should be you. I'm willing to. I'm willing to become younger. I try to reinvent myself every few years anyway.","I am 3.8 percent Neanderthal. One of my ancestors mated with a Neanderthal, and I am not embarrassed by that.","We have lots of Neanderthal parts around the lab. We are creating Neanderthal cells. Let's say someone has a healthy, normal Neanderthal baby. Well, then, everyone will want to have a Neanderthal kid. Were they superstrong or supersmart? Who knows? But there's one way to find out.","The first thing you have to do is to sequence the Neanderthal genome, and that has actually been done. The next step would be to chop this genome up into, say, 10,000 chunks and then... assemble all the chunks in a human stem cell, which would enable you to finally create a Neanderthal clone.","The one thing that is bad for society is low diversity. If you become a monoculture, you are at great risk of perishing. Therefore, the recreation of Neanderthals would be mainly a question of societal risk avoidance.","Neanderthals might think differently than we do. They could even be more intelligent than us. When the time comes to deal with an epidemic or getting off the planet, it's conceivable that their way of thinking could be beneficial."],"George M. Cohan":["I don't care what you say about me, as long as you say something about me, and as long as you spell my name right.","Ladies and gentlemen, my mother thanks you, my father thanks you, my sister thanks you, and I thank you!","Many a bum show has been saved by the flag.","Hurried and worried until we're buried, and there's no curtain call, Lifes a very funny proposition after all."],"George M. Humphrey":["You can't set a hen in one morning and have chicken salad for lunch.","It's a terribly hard job to spend a billion dollars and get your money's worth.","The goose lays the golden egg. Payrolls make consumers."],"George M. Whitesides":["Nanoengineering is learning how to make devices as small as 10 to 100 atoms in width. Much of the work is going on in the electronics industry, where there is great demand to pack more components onto computer chips.","Simplicity, for reasons that are a little bit obscure, is almost not pursued, at least in the academic world.","Chemists have always been in the business of taking atoms and putting them together with other atoms with precisely defined connections.","We academics - I am an academic - we love complexity. You can write papers about complexity, and the nice thing about complexity is it's fundamentally intractable in many ways, so you're not responsible for outcomes.","The virtue of binary is that it's the simplest possible way of representing numbers. Anything else is more complicated. You can catch errors with it, it's unambiguous in its reading, there are lots of good things about binary. So it is very, very simple once you learn how to read it.","The number of people who really work creatively on new sources of water isn't enormously large for the reason that I don't think people have very many ideas on how to get fundamentally new sources of water. We sort of think we've thought that problem through. I hope that's not true.","Because of climate changes, it's not just a question of producing energy. It's a question of producing energy in a way that we can live with in the long term. If you look at the available pieces, from conservation to nuclear, solar, whatever, and you put them all together, we can't do it.","One of the issues in electronics is that we work only in two scales - transistors and collections of transistors - and that's the device. But to take full advantage of nano, we're going to have to think about that full hierarchy of levels of structure.","Part of science is the questioning of authority, absolute freedom of ideology. The Soviets did some very good science, but when science ran into ideology, it had trouble. Science flourishes best in a democracy.","Capitalism is a wonderful economic engine, but it assigns little value to long-term projects or societal problems.","Science has the potential to solve all kinds of problems, but it depends on what a society wants to accomplish."],"George MacDonald Fraser":["It may be tripe, but it's my tripe - and I do urge other authors to resist encroachments on their brain-children and trust their own judgment rather than that of some zealous meddler with a diploma in creative punctuation who is just dying to get into the act.","I think little of people who will deny their history because it doesn't present the picture they would like.","Political correctness is about denial, usually in the weasel circumlocutory jargon which distorts and evades and seldom stands up to honest analysis.","I loathe all political parties, which I regard as inventions of the devil. My favourite prime minister was Sir Alec Douglas-Home, not because he was on the Right, but because he spent a year in office without, on his own admission, doing a damned thing.","I'm rather a cynic, I suppose. I do not believe in the niceness of humanity.","What is overlooked is the astonishing amount of history Hollywood has got right... For better or worse, nothing has been more influential in shaping our visions of the past than the commercial cinema.","Tony Blair is not just the worst prime minister we've ever had, but by far the worst prime minister we've ever had. It makes my blood boil to think of the British soldiers who've died for that little liar."],"George MacDonald":["To be trusted is a greater compliment than being loved.","How strange this fear of death is! We are never frightened at a sunset.","Man finds it hard to get what he wants, because he does not want the best; God finds it hard to give, because He would give the best, and man will not take it.","Few delights can equal the presence of one whom we trust utterly.","Many a thief is a better man than many a clergyman, and miles nearer to the gate of the kingdom.","A beast does not know that he is a beast, and the nearer a man gets to being a beast, the less he knows it.","The first thing a kindness deserves is acceptance, the second, transmission.","If instead of a gem, or even a flower, we should cast the gift of a loving thought into the heart of a friend, that would be giving as the angels give.","To have what we want is riches; but to be able to do without is power.","Afflictions are but the shadows of God's wings.","To keep a lamp burning we have to keep putting oil in it.","The more I work with the body, keeping my assumptions in a temporary state of reservation, the more I appreciate and sympathize with a given disease. The body no longer appears as a sick or irrational demon, but as a process with its own inner logic and wisdom.","Love is the opener as well as closer of eyes.","The principle part of faith is patience.","It matters little where a man may be at this moment; the point is whether he is growing.","The best preparation for the future is the present well seen to, and the last duty done.","We die daily. Happy those who daily come to life as well.","You can't live on amusement. It is the froth on water - an inch deep and then the mud.","I find that doing of the will of God leaves me no time for disputing about His plans.","Forgiveness is the giving, and so the receiving, of life.","When we are out of sympathy with the young, then I think our work in this world is over.","Friends, if we be honest with ourselves, we shall be honest with each other.","It is not in the nature of politics that the best men should be elected. The best men do not want to govern their fellowmen.","It is not the cares of today, but the cares of tomorrow, that weigh a man down.","Attitudes are more important than facts.","Anything large enough for a wish to light upon, is large enough to hang a prayer upon.","Age is not all decay; it is the ripening, the swelling, of the fresh life within, that withers and bursts the husk.","Where there is no choice, we do well to make no difficulty.","It is our best work that God wants, not the dregs of our exhaustion. I think he must prefer quality to quantity.","There are thousands willing to do great things for one willing to do a small thing."],"George MacKay":["Diversity is best in all contexts.","My mum was a costume designer and costume supervisor in the theater and, especially, the ballet. But that was before I was born.","My dad used to work in the theater as a stage manager, production manager, and lighting designer.","If you've got a camera that's two feet away from you, you have to bring it all back down. It's a lot more insular. It's different brush strokes. Whereas on stage, you're playing to people who, depending on the size of the theater, might be 40 meters away from you.","When me and my sister were toddlers, it was 'The Jungle Book' literally every day. If it was lunchtime, it was 'Jungle Book' time.","Acting is all about creative ideas and sharing, so the more places those ideas come from, the better.","There's a loyalty attached to football, and it is more communal than theatre. If you go to the football, it is part of the structure of your life. For lots of people, theatre is a treat.","Glasgow's really friendly, with this impressive mix of real solidarity and identity that's very personal.","Reading nice stuff about you is lovely, but I know it's going to be soul-destroying when you do something that everyone is tearing apart.","My dad's Australian.","I audition for a lot and don't get a lot.","I wouldn't want to ever complain about having the opportunity to audition.","What I'd like to do is try as many different ways of working as possible. That's what I'm looking to do - collaborate with as many different directors.","I got to do school properly and all the stuff that you should do when you're young and teenage: first friends, first girlfriends. It wasn't like I needed to be doing acting.","The more I can be the character, the further I can get away from myself, the better.","I had to try to understand how much of a taboo it was. My mum worked in ballet and theatre when she was younger, and I had been brought up around lots of gay people, so I had never had any issue and couldn't imagine how hard it was to be out.","I think, when you're younger, you're slightly spoilt with the situation you get put in and to get to work with the people I got to work with without really thinking about it.","I want as much as I can to try and explore different roles and different characters; that's important to me to get involved in as many different parts as I can.","I guess I'm taking for granted how open my parents are.","I seem to have a bit of a knack for accents; I can pick them up quick enough.","You would not get out of bed in the morning if you were constantly worrying about the possibility of something happening to you on your way to work. But it is still something to pay attention to, I think."],"George Martin":["What I was trying to convey there was the kind of waste land that was left after the war. It was a bit like one always thinks of war, you know, stark scenery and no birds, no trees, no leaves, nothing living. And just emptiness.","I think that one of the nice things about the Yellow Submarine movie is that it seems to be perennial. People enjoy watching from each generation. And it was like the Beatles themselves. You know the Beatles seem to find new audience each time another generation comes along.","He was definitely a father figure for all of us. Once you were a Giant, you were always a Giant.","Well, again working strictly to the film, where you had this lovely, lovely land of brightness and color. And everybody is smiling and happy and butterflies flitting around and it was that kind of image that, it was like a dream world, really.","And the young people in the 1960's identified with it immediately, because, I guess the young people had been having years of repression really. They felt that the, you know, after the war everything was very austere, particularly in Europe.","Well, I think, I certainly used backward music in Sea of Monsters. I can't remember in the Sea of Time. I would tend to do that all the time, you know? I tended to do all sorts of weird things. Just to get effects.","Because when the film was first mooted, the Beatles didn't like the idea at all. In fact they wouldn't have any part in it. And when Brian had committed them, it was part of a deal he did with United Artists, I think.","We're lucky, real lucky. Our friends lost their house. We just had some burning embers put holes in the screens.","When you extend life span, that's really something. That's hard to do."],"George Mason":["I ask, sir, what is the militia? It is the whole people except for a few public officials.","We came equals into this world, and equals shall we go out of it.","In all our associations; in all our agreements let us never lose sight of this fundamental maxim - that all power was originally lodged in, and consequently is derived from, the people.","A few years' experience will convince us that those things which at the time they happened we regarded as our greatest misfortunes have proved our greatest blessings.","All men are by nature born equally free and independent.","Every society, all government, and every kind of civil compact therefore, is or ought to be, calculated for the general good and safety of the community.","Habituated from our Infancy to trample upon the Rights of Human Nature, every generous, every liberal Sentiment, if not extinguished, is enfeebled in our Minds.","The augmentation of slaves weakens the states; and such a trade is diabolical in itself, and disgraceful to mankind.","Your dear baby has died innocent and blameless, and has been called away by an all wise and merciful Creator, most probably from a life to misery and misfortune, and most certainly to one of happiness and bliss.","As nations can not be rewarded or punished in the next world they must be in this.","The poor despise labor when performed by slaves.","There is a Passion natural to the Mind of man, especially a free Man, which renders him impatient of Restraint.","Attend with Diligence and strict Integrity to the Interest of your Correspondents and enter into no Engagements which you have not the almost certain Means of performing.","I begin to grow heartily tired of the etiquette and nonsense so fashionable in this city.","I wish I knew where to get a good one myself; for I find cold Sheets extreamly disagreeable.","As much as I value an union of all the states, I would not admit the southern states into the union, unless they agreed to the discontinuance of this disgraceful trade, because it would bring weakness and not strength to the union.","I retired from public Business from a thorough Conviction that it was not in my Power to do any Good, and very much disgusted with Measures, which appeared to me inconsistent with common Policy and Justice.","Slavery discourages arts and manufactures.","Taught to regard a part of our own Species in the most abject and contemptible Degree below us, we lose that Idea of the dignity of Man which the Hand of Nature had implanted in us, for great and useful purposes."],"George Mastras":["I started writing prose before I started writing television. Then 'Breaking Bad' came around, and to me, writing 'Breaking Bad' is like writing a novel each season. So it's been very creatively satisfying writing for the show.","The scene is never really about moving the story forward on 'Breaking Bad.' That's the functional veneer of the scene, but it's always about what's going on with the characters.","I'm kind of an all-in person. If I'm going to direct I'm going to take the challenge on."],"George Matthew Adams":["A cheerful frame of mind, reinforced by relaxation... is the medicine that puts all ghosts of fear on the run.","Beauty of expression is so akin to the voice of the sea.","Character is greater than talent, genius, fame, money, friends - there is nothing to compare with it. A man may have all these and yet remain comparatively useless - be unhappy - and die a bankrupt in soul.","We cannot waste time. We can only waste ourselves.","Sailing a boat calls for quick action, a blending of feeling with the wind and water as well as with the very heart and soul of the boat itself. Sailing teaches alertness and courage, and gives in return a joyousness and peace that but few sports afford.","I say to myself that I shall try to make my life like an open fireplace, so that people may be warmed and cheered by it and so go out themselves to warm and cheer.","There is no such thing as a 'self-made' man. We are made up of thousands of others.","No matter what your work today, if it is worth while at all - time to plan it out, time to do it well, and time to finish it, is your day's greatest gift and your greatest job.","It is a great thing to have a big brain, a fertile imagination, grand ideals, but the man with these, bereft of a good backbone, is sure to serve no useful end.","People who look down never get much of an idea of the sky where the stars are set. And the fellow who doesn't hitch at least one or two of his wagons to a star never gets very high up. Get your eyes off the ground.

I don't care how great, how famous or successful a man or woman may be, each hungers for applause.","The birth of the baby Jesus stands as the most significant event in all history, because it has meant the pouring into a sick world the healing medicine of love which has transformed all manner of hearts for almost two thousand years.","It is easier to win than to fail. Everybody sides with the winner. But the failure walks alone.","What you think means more than anything else in your life. More than what you earn, more than where you live, more than your social position, and more than what anyone else may think about you.","The easiest thing in the world is to succeed. You can't help it if you follow the rules and play the game the best way you know how according to yourself, instead of according to the one next to you, or above you, or somewhere away from you.","No one owns you. One hundred per cent of the stock in your personal corporation belongs to you.","Few people wear out before their time. Mostly they rust out, worry out, run out - spill out. A machine must have care and its different parts must be adjusted properly. No machine has ever approached the human machine. When it is right, it is in health.","No one ever gets too big to make mistakes. The secret is that the big man is greater than his mistakes, because he rises right out of them and passes beyond them.","It's marvelous the change that comes about when a man gets together all his forces and centers them upon the doing of one thing at a time.","Courage is heartworth making itself felt in deeds. It never waits for chances; it makes chances.","The further you get from nature, the less happy you are; and the nearer, the more exultant you become over the world and all that there is in it.","People do not want what we have in our pockets half as much as they want what is in our hearts. If we combine both, intelligently, however, according to our means, we give wisely and well.","What is more beautiful than a sea of water with a number of white-winged boats skirting its surface? Poetry and beauty contesting with the wind and the waves!"],"George McGovern":["I thought the Vietnam war was an utter, unmitigated disaster, so it was very hard for me to say anything good about it.","The highest patriotism is not a blind acceptance of official policy, but a love of one's country deep enough to call her to a higher plain.","I was the guy who was constantly speaking out against the Vietnam War. I have no regrets about that.","From secrecy and deception in high places, come home, America. From military spending so wasteful that it weakens our nation, come home, America.","If you're Iran's minister of defense, I think you'd try to develop at least one nuclear weapon to save yourself from what happened to Iraq.","There is a strong tendency in the United States to rally round the flag and their troops, no matter how mistaken the war.","When I was a youngster growing up in South Dakota, we never referred to the national debt, it was always referred to as the war debt because it stemmed from World War I.","I'm fed up to the ears with old men dreaming up wars for young men to die in.","Somehow politicians have become convinced that negative campaigning pays off in elections.","I was tired. I hadn't slept eight hours in two, three years. I lived on four, five hours of sleep. You can do it during a campaign because thousands are screaming for you. You're getting adrenaline shots each day. Then the campaign ends, and there are no more shots.","I flew a full string of 35 combat missions over some of the most heavily defended targets in Europe. We were hitting Hitler's oil refineries, his tank factories, his aircraft factories, his railway yards. Those were our prime targets.","I think the country's getting disgusted with Washington partly because of the decline of civility in government.","It really is true that an orator is simply a good man who speaks well.","It is not patriotic to commit young Americans to war unless our national security clearly requires it.","I think it was my study of history that convinced me that the Democratic Party was more on the side of the average American.","At least I have precluded the possibility of peaking too early.","The truth is that I oppose the Iraq war, just as I opposed the Vietnam War, because these two conflicts have weakened the U.S. and diminished our standing in the world and our national security.","Democrats believe that the federal government is not our enemy, it's our partner.","I wish I had known more firsthand about the concerns and problems of American businesspeople while I was a U.S. senator and later a presidential nominee. That knowledge would have made me a better legislator and a more worthy aspirant to the White House.","No man should advocate a course in private that he's ashamed to admit in public.","The whole campaign was a tragic case of mistaken identity.","I am 1,000 percent for Tom Eagleton and I have no intention of dropping him from the ticket.","Politics is an act of faith; you have to show some kind of confidence in the intellectual and moral capacity of the public.","The longer the title, the less important the job.","You know, sometimes, when they say you're ahead of your time, it's just a polite way of saying you have a real bad sense of timing.","The Establishment center... has led us into the stupidest and cruelest war in all history. That war is a moral and political disaster - a terrible cancer eating away at the soul of our nation.","I am fed up with a system which busts the pot smoker and lets the big dope racketeer go free.","I always thought of myself as a good old South Dakota boy who grew up here on the prairie.","My dad was a Methodist minister.","I'm what a normal, healthy, ideal American should be like.","I've enjoyed myself 90 percent of the time.","I move ahead, I live.","I met my wife in South Dakota.","I never even had the time to read novels.","It's nice not to have to worry about constituents.","Now, I simply do what I want.","I'm constantly meeting people who said that they cast their first vote for me, or that they cut their eye teeth on the 1972 campaign, or that they didn't vote for me but admire my positions.","I am a liberal and always have been - just not the wild-eyed character the Republicans made me out to be.","I have to have a passion in my life.","When you start one of these programs, school lunch programs, in a country that heretofore had nothing of that kind, immediately school enrollment jumps dramatically. Girls and boys get to the classroom with the promise of a good meal once a day.","I hope I live long enough to see every hungry school child in the world being fed under the so-called McGovern-Dole program.","I did frequently refer to my war record in World War II, but not in any flamboyant way.","One of the sharp parallels is that neither Vietnam nor Iraq was the slightest threat to America's national security.","As an American, I want our forces to prevail.","I would not plan to base my campaign primarily on opposition to the war in the Persian Gulf.","Every once in a while, I run into somebody who tells me that she met her husband in my campaign or a husband who says, I met my wife.

I don't think that's necessarily true.","I'm a movie buff.","Under the guise of protecting us from ourselves, the right and the left are becoming ever more aggressive in regulating behavior.","I've come to realize that protecting freedom of choice in our everyday lives is essential to maintaining a healthy civil society.","Everyone is exposed to economic risks of some kind.","I seek the presidency because I believe deeply in the American promise and can no longer accept the diminishing of that promise.","I make one pledge above all others - to seek and speak the truth with all the resources of mind and spirit I command.","I seek to call America home to those principles that gave us birth."],"George Mercer Dawson":["The sand stones had fragments of charcoal on some surfaces but found no recognisable fossils.","Selenite occurs in abundance in well formed clear crystals of several inches in length.","A duck's nest was found today near the trail on the dry open prairie with as far as could be seen no water or marsh near.

You're going to keep me lonely, so I have to ignore you.'","I have never thought about my sexuality being right or wrong. To me it has always been a case of finding the right person.","I try very hard to thank my lucky stars and keep it all in proportion and perspective, but it can be very tiring having a smiley face all day.","Anybody who fights for human rights or to make this world a better place. Nurses, doctors, teachers: these are the people who deserve the credit these days.","I had been obsessed with insects and creepy-crawlies: I used to get up at five o'clock in the morning and go out into this field behind our garden and collect insects before everyone else got up, and suddenly, all I wanted to know about was music. It just seemed a very, very strange thing.","I'm surprised that I've survived my own dysfunction, really.","I never really told my parents that I wanted to be a pop star or anything. They just knew that I was totally obsessed with music. Funnily enough, my father always used to say that he didn't think I could sing.","I would advise any gay person that being out in the real sense can never happen too soon.","I knew, regardless of anything else, singing in front of an orchestra was going to be inspirational. It would feed me.","I realised those things my ego needed - fame and success - were going to make me terribly unhappy. So I wrenched myself away from that. I had to. I had to walk away from America and say goodbye to the biggest part of my career because I knew, otherwise, my demons would get the better of me.","I had very little fear about it, but basically, my straight friends talked me out of it. I think they thought as I was bisexual, there was no need to. But it's amazing how much more complicated it became because I didn't come out in the early days. I often wonder if my career would have taken a different path if I had.","I still believe that music is one of the greatest gifts that God gave to man.","I have never felt any ethnic connection between the Greeks and me other than how hairy I am.","The whole business is built on ego, vanity, self-satisfaction, and it's total crap to pretend it's not.","There are so many things and so many aspects to gay life that I've discovered and so many things to write about. I have a new life, and I have a new take on dance music because of that life.","Is my body a temple, or is my life a temple? I'm definitely in the latter category, and I think my life has been better since thinking that way.","It's important to me that I should be free to express myself.","Not many people are really that meticulous with what they do, I suppose, but I'm just a control freak and terribly afraid of failure or regret. I work very hard on these things.","If you don't feel you're reaching something new, then don't do it.","I have the audience I deserve. Or at least I have the audience that represents the kind of people that I like.","It's almost required with major artists that there's some duality. And I've got duality everywhere.","The fact I had my father as an adversary was such a powerful tool to work with. I subconsciously fought him to the degree that I drove me to be one of the most successful musician in the world.","I never minded being thought of as a pop star. People have always thought I wanted to be seen as a serious musician, but I didn't, I just wanted people to know that I was absolutely serious about pop music.","I don't consider Americans bullies, but I do consider the American government bullying.","The media has affected everybody's consciousness much more than most people will admit.","I spent years growing up being told what my sexuality was.","A lot of people like me, who've been around for years and years and years, only really lose it in their forties and fifties.","I'm not anti-American. I've lived with Kenny, a Texan, for six years.","I define my sexuality in terms of the people that I love.","Everything was going my way. I was happily marching into the history books. Then it all just fell apart.","Celebrity and secrets don't go together. The bastards will get you in the end.","There's no comfort in the truth, pain is all you'll find.","If I can just live further from the spotlight I think that'll be better for all really.","I've written a whole body of work that I'm incredibly proud of.","I don't have joy in watching myself, whereas, actually, I quite like listening to my own music.","I can't bear Catholicism.","There is no such thing as a reluctant star.","I don't really have any traits that I deplore. I get annoyed with myself sometimes, but that's about it.","No one wants to look wholesome at 21!","The press seemed to take some delight that I previously had a 'straight audience,' and set about trying to destroy that. And I think some men were frustrated that their girlfriends wouldn't let go of the idea that George Michael just hadn't found the 'right girl.'","In the years when HIV was a killer, any parent of an openly gay person was terrified. I knew my mother well enough that she would spend every day praying that I didn't come across that virus. She'd have worried like that.","I'd like to say things are bound to get better, but I don't really believe it.","When you are trying to express things with metaphors and much more subtlety, that's when you are doing yourself a disservice by making a video.","Even though it's become a really cliched thing to see musicians working for charity, it's still effective and it still has to be done.","Your political system is actually too democratic. The fact that Americans vote on every bill and proposition can prolong bigotry indefinitely, especially where it is aimed at minority groups.","With pop stars or film stars, we become the object of people's self-definition, as well as the object of sexual definition.","Of course, I want to sell this record - there's no point making it otherwise.","My American gay audience have continued to dance and sing to the music I make in a way that straight Americans haven't. I am grateful to them for that.","I've never done anything so political before. I've spent years shouting my mouth off about serious issues over dinner tables but never really had the confidence to express my views in a song.","I want to make a pop album - something more upbeat than my stuff was in the '90s.","I think the media is a real demon.","I think for most of us, our biggest frailties are sexual.","I left school at 17 and was a star by the time I was 18 - in certain parts of the world anyway.","It's absolutely essential that we have the same safeguards that straight couples do. But I want more than a 50 percent chance of success. I don't want to emulate that.","I have more love, success, and security than I could ever dream of.","I'm the luckiest writer on earth.","I don't really think that there is anyone in the modern pop business who I feel I want to spar with.","I've achieved what every artist wants, which is that some of their work will outlive them.","I am a political person, though not with a big P.","I've been very well remunerated for my talents over the years so I really don't need the public's money.","The truth is my love life has been a lot more turbulent than I have let on.","You can't imagine what it's like playing to people who have been loyal to you for 25 years and haven't seen you for 15.","I mean, I've done different things at different times that I shouldn't have done, once or twice, you know.","My ego is sated.","I watch people who are not driven by creativity any more, and I think how dull it must be to produce the same kind of thing. If you don't feel you're reaching something new, then don't do it.","The '90s were a bit of a disaster for me in so many ways. On a personal level, I don't think I could have toured. Also, I had some physical problems with my back that are now sorted and I just wasn't in the right state of mind.","I have got other interests than just making music. I would like to follow those interests through.","I'm not a novelty act from the '80s in most parts of the world.","I really have no plans for any kind of career in TV or anything, but if I wanted to become good at it, I could. But I don't really think it's in the cards.","It's only when the kids are in their late twenties that families really face up to what they are.","My depression at the end of Wham! was because I was beginning to realise I was gay, not bi.","I had to walk away from America, and say goodbye to the biggest part of my career, because I knew otherwise my demons would get the better of me.","I'm just not security-minded.","If someone really wants to hurt you, they'll find a way whatever. I don't want to live my life worrying about it.","I went to prison, I paid my bill.","I'm lucky to be alive.","I have to believe that somebody up there thinks I've still got some work to do.","Stars are almost always people that want to make up for their own weaknesses by being loved by the public and I'm no exception to that.","I don't want to look at other people my age in leather. Why would I put it on?","I find it too terrifying to go out in L.A.","English people have seen me get through scandals.","I've always been the porky boy in my head.","I went through a long period where I was afraid of doing things I wanted to do, and you get your courage back, which is what's important.","I know I have a very self-destructive tendency since my mother died, I have got to be honest.","I write about my life.","I do want people to know that the songs that I wrote when I was with women were really about women. And the songs that I've written since have been fairly obvious about men.","I am really not interested or excited by repeating former successes.","Because of the media, the way the world is perceived is as a place where resources and time are running out. We're taught that you have to grab what you can before it's gone. It's almost as if there isn't time for compassion.","You can't have a child just to keep a relationship together, can you?","In the very early days of Wham! the attention felt great, but I do wonder how much freedom I gave away by trying to become something I wasn't.","I owe my mother who I am, and my father my drive.","I spent the first half of my career being accused of being gay when I hadn't had anything like a gay relationship.","In terms of my work, I've never been reticent in terms of defining my sexuality. I write about my life.","The first sign of real obsession with music was with an old wind-up gramophone that mum had thrown out into the garage. My parents gave me three old 45s - two Supremes records and one Tom Jones record - and I used to come home from school literally every day, go out to the garage, wind this thing up, and play them.","There are things about my mum that I only realised later, things that make me admire her.","Deep down, my ego always thought that I would outlast a lot of people that I was competing against.","I'm 10-12 years into life as an out gay man, and I'm a different person. I think there are things about my journey that might be useful to other people, and coming up with a hit record on its own doesn't seem to be enough anymore.","I have no belief in The Bible or religion, but I think Armageddon was a lucky guess. I honestly think it's going to happen.","Apart from some of the videos and haircuts, I don't think I've made any wrong moves, ha ha!","I was brought up when media still kept totally away from violence when it came to children. I don't think it would have made me scared of violence, but I find it repulsive.","I know that I sound self-satisfied, and I know that I've got an ego, but I don't have an ego problem.","I used to believe that George Michael was a total actor. It was self-defeating, because it made me also feel fraudulent.","For some strange reason, my gay life didn't get easier when I came out. Quite the opposite happened, really.","I'm not stupid enough to think that I can deal with another 10 or 15 years of major exposure. I think that is the ultimate tragedy of fame... People who are simply out of control, who are lost. I've seen so many of them, and I don't want to be another cliche.","It's strange. At some point in your career, the situation between yourself and the camera reverses. For a certain number of years, you court it and you need it, but ultimately, it needs you more, and it's a bit like a relationship. The minute that happens, it turns you off... and it does feel like it is taking something from you.","I'd been out to a lot of people since 19. I wish to God it had happened then. I don't think I would have the same career - my ego might not have been satisfied in some areas - but I think I would have been a happier man."],"George Mikes":["An Englishman, even if he is alone, forms an orderly queue of one.","On the Continent people have good food; in England people have good table manners.","When people say England, they sometimes mean Great Britain, sometimes the United Kingdom, sometimes the British Isles, - but never England.","The world still consists of two clearly divided groups: the English and the foreigners. One group consists of less than 50 million people; the other of 3,950 million. The latter group does not really count.","Jokes are better than war. Even the most aggressive jokes are better than the least aggressive wars.

I just kept working at it.","It is a pretty odd profession - tickling people - but it can be lucrative.","People looking at advertisements or reading their local newspapers would have had no idea that what they were reading was bought and paid for with their tax dollars.","The administration is using the devastation of Hurricane Katrina to cut the wages of people desperately trying to rebuild their lives and their communities.","I was what they call a pool hustler. That's absolutely true. For long periods of time I got by, barely skimmed by, just playing pool.","I used to jog three miles a day, and then I saw I was getting a little bit older, so I started fast-walking three miles a day.

There are few blessings on Earth greater for a believer; and yet the Lord is frequently obliged to teach us the value of this blessing by depriving us of it for a season.","The natural mind is ever prone to reason, when we ought to believe; to be at work, when we ought to be quiet; to go our own way, when we ought steadily to walk on in God's ways, however trying to nature.","If we say we trust in Him, but in reality do not, then God, taking us at our word, lets us see that we do not really confide in Him; and hence failure arises.","Wherever God has given faith, it is given, among other reasons, for the very purpose of being tried.","Often the work of the Lord itself may be a temptation to keep us from that communion with Him which is so essential to the benefit of our own souls.","Through faith in the Lord Jesus alone can we obtain forgiveness of our sins, and be at peace with God; but, believing in Jesus, we become, through this very faith, the children of God; have God as our Father, and may come to Him for all the temporal and spiritual blessings which we need.","Either we trust in God, and in that case we neither trust in ourselves, nor in our fellow-men, nor in circumstances, nor in anything besides; or we do trust in one or more of these, and in that case do not trust in God.","The joy which answers to prayer give, cannot be described; and the impetus which they afford to the spiritual life is exceedingly great.","The longer I live, the more I am enabled to realize that I have but one life to live on Earth, and that this one life is but a brief life, for sowing, in comparison with eternity, for reaping.","What a bitter, bitter thing is the service of Satan, even in this world!","Just as God's love to us believers, his children, is unalterably the same, whatever may be the manifestations of that love; and as his peace with us is the same, however much our peace may be disturbed; so it is also with regard to our being in fellowship or partnership with him: it remains unalterably the same so far as God is concerned.","A servant of God has but one Master. It ill becomes the servant to seek to be rich, and great, and honored in that world where his Lord was poor, and mean, and despised.","If honest of heart and uprightness before God were lacking or if I did not patiently wait on God for instruction, or if I preferred the counsel of my fellow-men to the declarations of the Word of God, I made great mistakes.","They that trust in the Lord shall never be confounded!","To enter upon the marriage union is one of the most deeply important events of life. It cannot be too prayerfully treated. Our happiness, our usefulness, our living for God or for ourselves afterwards, are often most intimately connected with our choice. Therefore, in the most prayerful manner, this choice should be made.","How important it is to ascertain the will of God, before we undertake anything, because we are then not only blessed in our own souls, but also the work of our hands will prosper.","To ascertain the Lord's will, we ought to use scriptural means. Prayer, the word of God, and His Spirit should be united together. We should go to the Lord repeatedly in prayer, and ask Him to teach us by His Spirit through His word.","I desire many things concerning myself; but I desire nothing so much, as to have a heart filled with love to the Lord. I long for a warm personal attachment to Him.","As a warning to parents, I mention that my father preferred me to my brother, which was very injurious to both of us. To me, as tending to produce in my mind a feeling of self-elevation; and to my brother, by creating in him a dislike both towards my father and me.","It is a common temptation of Satan to make us give up the reading of the Word and prayer when our enjoyment is gone; as if it were of no use to read the Scriptures when we do not enjoy them, and as if it were no use to pray when we have no spirit of prayer.","I hope in God, I pray on, and look yet for the answer. They are not converted yet, but they will be.","I seek the Will of the Spirit of God through, or in connection with, the Word of God. The Spirit and the Word must be combined. If I look to the Spirit alone without the Word, I lay myself open to great delusions also.","Do but stand still in the hour of trial, and you will see the help of God, if you trust in Him. But there is so often a forsaking the ways of the Lord in the hour of trial, and thus the food of faith, the means whereby our faith may be increased, is lost.","A child rightly trained may be a world-wide blessing, with an influence reaching onward to eternal years. But a neglected or misdirected directed child may live to blight and blast mankind, and leave influences of evil which shall roll on in increasing volume till they plunge into the gulf of eternal perdition.","There were few people, perhaps, more passionately fond of travelling, and seeing fresh places, and new scenes, than myself; but now, since, by the grace of God, I have seen beauty in the Lord Jesus, I have lost my taste for these things.","Let no one profess to trust in God, and yet lay up for future wants, otherwise the Lord will first send him to the hoard he has amassed, before He can answer the prayer for more.","The Lord never lays more on us, in the way of chastisement, than our state of heart makes needful; so that whilst He smites with the one hand, He supports with the other.","Be assured that Christianity is something more than forms and creeds and ceremonies: there is life, and power, and reality, in our holy faith.","My father, who educated his children on worldly principles, gave us much money, considering our age; not in order that we might spend it, but, as he said, to accustom us to possess money without spending it. The result was, that it led me and my brother into many sins.","The individual who desires to have his sins forgiven, must seek for it through the blood of Jesus. The individual who desires to get power over sin, must likewise seek it through the blood of Jesus.","It is of immense importance for the understanding of the word of God, to read it in course, so that we may read every day a portion of the Old and a portion of the New Testament, going on where we previously left off.","It might be asked, 'How much time shall I allow myself for rest?' The answer is that no rule of universal application can be given, as all persons do not require the same measure of sleep, and also the same persons, at different times, according to the strength or weakness of their body, may require more or less."],"George Murphy":["How can you practice dancing in an airplane? There's a law against it.","I'd like to make a movie pretty soon, so I could get a rest."],"George Murray":["With 'Carousel' I had an idea and it all came out quickly.","I feel as though I've fooled the world into thinking I'm an adult and now they're letting me procreate.","A sequence works in a way a collection never can.","Even the people who have had success and made money writing these books of fiction seem to feel the need to pretend it's no big deal, or part of a natural progression from poetry to fiction, but often it's really just about the money, the perceived prestige.","Humour is a fine line to walk in poetry, as in fiction. I just think it's harder to write. It's harder to keep the respect of the reader too.","I am certainly suffering from a modicum of performance anxiety.","I am still interested in the long or serial poem, but have written a few smaller things. I may start sending to journals again in a year or so... that's about it.","I do try to let what is obviously unintended yet naturally good stay in.","I don't think there's anything wrong with someone having to read a poem twice. Or even a book.","I guess there is also an element of deliberate change involved. Each of my books has been, at least from my point of view, radically different from the last.","I no longer feel pressure to produce fiction.","I still write the occasional short story, and poked at a novel once, but it's just not what I want to do.","I suppress the vast majority of what I write.","I think the main influence has been living in New York City. Aside from all the crap around 9/11, I find it very demanding to think amid all the noise and visual pollution.","I think, for me, humour needs to be used like a strong spice - sparingly.","I wanted to rock back and forth between myth and distant futures, yesterday, today, and tomorrow. It felt a bit like prophecy and a bit like storytelling.","I was writing notes, but not composing poems. The Hunter began to develop out of this fragmented process.","I'm not interested in being easy anymore. Readable, yes. Easy, no.","I've often entertained paranoid suspicions about my fridge and what it's been doing to my poetry when I'm not looking, but I never even considered that my fan was thinking about me.","In fact, in some ways, I actually feel much more confident about the quality of Carousel than I do about The Cottage Builder's Letter: probably because of its cohesive nature.","In my opinion, Al Moritz may be the best poet of his generation in Canada.","It's a bit of a crapshoot out there with young writers right now anyway.","My self-editing process is intense.","New York was breaking my concentration and disintegrating my thoughts.","The poetry community here has been extraordinarily welcoming.","The whole competition thing disturbs me. Not that I wasn't a part of it when I first started.","Then I discovered I loved writing poetry more than fiction.","Well, we all start thinking we're going to be Romantic rock stars, but then reality hits and you realize no one reads you but other poets."],"George Nethercutt":["If we win, we'll make history, and I'll serve you on the Agriculture Committee.","Some of my friends said, 'You are nuts.' But I think I am right.","They want the Olympics. We ought to make sure they don't get the Olympics.","I don't want anybody suspecting I am some sheep and part of the Washington D.C. establishment.","If I can't affect some change in six years, maybe I'm in the wrong place.","My effectiveness is best placed in solving problems through federal solutions.","Students who are interested in learning about the environment should not be dissuaded from doing so, but only if they have proved their proficiency in other basic courses, such as U.S. history. Until then, we need to focus on producing well-educated citizens steeped in their country's history and mindful of their civic responsibilities.","Securing freedom has been a singular commitment of American presidents and patriots in and out of government for generations. But its perpetual continuation is not guaranteed.","If succeeding generations of Americans don't understand the concepts of justice, individual rights, free enterprise, capitalism, sovereignty or national security, there can be no guarantee that those concepts - or others like them - will continue.","From computers to information technology to airplanes, it has been America's unique blend of republican government and free-market capitalism that has allowed us to surpass all other nations in history."],"George Newbern":["Raising children is like a hit and run. You've been hit, you can't flag the person down, you're wounded and you don't know who to blame, and no one helps you. And it's weeks, maybe months, before you find out what really happened.","When I first came to L.A., I was plotting out my career choices as if I actually had a choice. Unless you're Brad Pitt, Johnny Depp, impossibly good-looking, or look like a freak, you have to be malleable and open to everything that comes your way because that's what makes it possible to pay your mortgage and eat.","I did a lot of musicals when I was younger. And then I went to Northwestern University, and I did more musicals. I went on to do more work in Chicago, and then while I was in college, I got flown out to Los Angeles to do a screen test for 'Back to the Future.' When I got to Los Angeles, I was like, 'Hmmm, this is different.'","I think any politician, regardless of their religious conviction, has to be a megalomaniac - they have to be! Anyone who works in that kind of job has to be so full of himself to do that kind of thing.","As an actor, you always feel like you're not going to work again. You're always unsure about how things are going to work out, and you start thinking you're going to just fade off into the distance.","I wasn't that great in sports. I started doing children's theater and loved it. I thought I had a great thing going with musicals. I thought, 'I can do this. It's fun.' I wanted to go for it, and I thought I'd like to make a living doing this.","I keep all irons in the fire because, 'You never know.' It's because I have to, and otherwise, life gets boring.","I go to the Catholic Church. God is an important part of my life. If he was not, I don't think I could have survived.","Doing narration is a totally different art form. I do some video games, and some that I've done are iconic.","I'm in the mood for 'Shark Tank' sometimes. When I am, my son and I can't stop watching. But I probably watch 'The Bachelor' more, and Scott Foley and I text about it, like, 'Oh my God, did you see that?!' I love it. It's such a train wreck.","With a movie, the die is cast. It is what it is. With TV, it's a living organism in a way. Fans can have input, with the whole social media thing, and they can track what fans are liking and not liking.","Look at these ISIS people. These people are ruthless. They don't operate by any sort of normal civilized code. That's the world. There's a shadow world that exists out there.","With Superman, super powers are just ancillary. It's that character, with all those principles and understanding... that's who he is right there. I think I tried to portray a sense of trust and power and charisma for Superman. That's what we believe Superman is.","I did a movie with Christopher Reeve when I first came to L.A. called 'Switching Channels.' I asked him if it was weird to be Superman. He said, 'You know, George, I've fought against this whole Superman thing, but one day I realized, 'Hey, I'm Superman.'' So, at some point, I just started saying, 'Good for me, I'm Bryan MacKenzie.'","No one really cares about you but you. They say they do, but everyone in Hollywood is a heat-seeking missile, and it's easy to go after the cute girl or guy that's new to town.","Acting in Los Angeles can be very isolating because you either have a job or you don't have a job - and if you don't have a job, it's all about getting out of your house. It sucks to sit around waiting. That's death.","I've done every imaginable job possible out there - movies, TV, animation, TV movies... and, at this point, almost reality, it seems. It's been a real blessing. It's been a great ride."],"George Noory":["Sometime I wish the aliens would abduct me and crown me as their leader.","Why are we outsourcing millions of high-paying jobs to China and India? Why don't we secure the border and stop the country from being flooded with millions of illegal immigrants? These are important questions on the mind of middle class voters all over America.","You do something annual every year, don't you?","I believe we could see a North American Union formed. Why else are our borders with Mexico and Canada being left wide open some six years into a War on Terror?","What I do is create an aura of mystery.","Well, with prophecy you got to see what happens.","I have never run for political office, but every night I am reaching out to millions of Americans on the radio and I am deeply concerned that the middle class of the United States is being sold out to multi-national corporations with a globalist agenda.","To be on 'Coast to Coast,' you have to be willing to stay awake in the middle of the night. But in return you get a great audience of millions of listeners all across the nation.","I've been a radio and television news person since I was 19 years old. I'm 57 years old now. But the advantage is that I have studied, investigated, and reported over those years on nearly every major story from wars and recessions to grass roots local issues.","It sounds kind of farfetched, yet I can't tell you how many people have had this syndrome... the 'Old Hag Syndrome.' Apparently, there's this little old lady who comes into your room at night, sits on your chest and tries to suffocate you. You can Google her - she'll pop up. She's out there.","We may not find the answers. We may not find Bigfoot. We may not find a chupacabra. We may not find out who was responsible for killing JFK, but we're going to keep looking, asking, probing. And one day - you know what? - we may get some of those answers.","With the millions of listeners to 'Coast to Coast AM,' I get constant feedback from people who are not happy with the current candidates. Maybe I will run for president in 2012.","We need a government that does not give in to a globalist agenda, an agenda I am now convinced seeks to bring American as a sovereign nation and the middle class to their knees.","Our fiat currency is under increasing stress with our large and growing trade deficits. We have a federal deficit that is calculated in the trillions when we take into account the net present value of the future Social Security and Medicaid obligations we are creating today.","I'm a staunch believer that we are in an earth cycle. There's no question the planet is changing, and the fact that the Mayans had an end date and their history talks of change, I find that fascinating.","It's so critical for people frustrated with the economy, with changing tides in government, who aren't able to hear their voices, questions or their ills being talked about, to have a place for discussing what others won't.","'Beyond Belief with George Noory' will be an hour-long show that cuts to the heart of what's going on with people today, topics wide-ranging and generally nonpolitical, but even more edgy."],"George Oppen":["Clarity, clarity, surely clarity is the most beautiful thing in the world, A limited, limiting clarity I have not and never did have any motive of poetry But to achieve clarity.","A discrete series is a series of terms each of which is empirically derived, each one of which is empirically true. And this is the reason for the fragmentary character of those poems.","A pure mathematical series would be one in which each term is derived from the preceding term by a rule.","The first question at that time in poetry was simply the question of honesty, of sincerity.","The situation of the Old Left was the theory of Socialist Realism, etc. It seemed pointless to argue. We stayed carefully away from people who wrote for the New Masses.","There are situations which cannot honorably be met by art.","Things explain each other, not themselves.","Truth, also is the pursuit of it."],"George Orwell":["War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.","In our age there is no such thing as 'keeping out of politics.' All issues are political issues, and politics itself is a mass of lies, evasions, folly, hatred and schizophrenia.","Happiness can exist only in acceptance.","Power is not a means, it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship.","Freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.","Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.","Political language... is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.","Big Brother is watching you.","Nationalism is power hunger tempered by self-deception.","All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.","People sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf.","The very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world. Lies will pass into history.","The essence of being human is that one does not seek perfection.","There are some ideas so wrong that only a very intelligent person could believe in them.","The quickest way of ending a war is to lose it.","But if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought.","If you want a vision of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face - forever.","Sometimes the first duty of intelligent men is the restatement of the obvious.","The great enemy of clear language is insincerity. When there is a gap between one's real and one's declared aims, one turns, as it were, instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish squirting out ink.","If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.","I'm fat, but I'm thin inside... there's a thin man inside every fat man.","Mankind is not likely to salvage civilization unless he can evolve a system of good and evil which is independent of heaven and hell.","Progress is not an illusion, it happens, but it is slow and invariably disappointing.","What can you do against the lunatic who is more intelligent than yourself, who gives your arguments a fair hearing and then simply persists in his lunacy?","So much of left-wing thought is a kind of playing with fire by people who don't even know that fire is hot.","Each generation imagines itself to be more intelligent than the one that went before it, and wiser than the one that comes after it.","All political thinking for years past has been vitiated in the same way. People can foresee the future only when it coincides with their own wishes, and the most grossly obvious facts can be ignored when they are unwelcome.","Liberal: a power worshipper without power.","Early in life I had noticed that no event is ever correctly reported in a newspaper.","In our time political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible.","To survive it is often necessary to fight and to fight you have to dirty yourself.","As with the Christian religion, the worst advertisement for Socialism is its adherents.","No advance in wealth, no softening of manners, no reform or revolution has ever brought human equality a millimeter nearer.","The aim of a joke is not to degrade the human being, but to remind him that he is already degraded.","The nationalist not only does not disapprove of atrocities committed by his own side, but he has a remarkable capacity for not even hearing about them.","Serious sport has nothing to do with fair play. It is bound up with hatred, jealousy, boastfulness, disregard of all rules and sadistic pleasure in witnessing violence. In other words, it is war minus the shooting.","Not to expose your true feelings to an adult seems to be instinctive from the age of seven or eight onwards.","Many people genuinely do not want to be saints, and it is probable that some who achieve or aspire to sainthood have never felt much temptation to be human beings.","One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes a revolution in order to establish a dictatorship.","All the war-propaganda, all the screaming and lies and hatred, comes invariably from people who are not fighting.","We have now sunk to a depth at which restatement of the obvious is the first duty of intelligent men.","We sleep safe in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would do us harm.","Every war when it comes, or before it comes, is represented not as a war but as an act of self-defense against a homicidal maniac.","Men are only as good as their technical development allows them to be.","The atom bombs are piling up in the factories, the police are prowling through the cities, the lies are streaming from the loudspeakers, but the earth is still going round the sun.","Advertising is the rattling of a stick inside a swill bucket.","Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them.","Oceania was at war with Eurasia; therefore Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia.","Whoever is winning at the moment will always seem to be invincible.","Language ought to be the joint creation of poets and manual workers.","The intellectual is different from the ordinary man, but only in certain sections of his personality, and even then not all the time.","Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, all else follows.","We of the sinking middle class may sink without further struggles into the working class where we belong, and probably when we get there it will not be so dreadful as we feared, for, after all, we have nothing to lose.","Men can only be happy when they do not assume that the object of life is happiness.","Patriotism is usually stronger than class hatred, and always stronger than internationalism.","To walk through the ruined cities of Germany is to feel an actual doubt about the continuity of civilization.","Myths which are believed in tend to become true.","Good writing is like a windowpane.","War against a foreign country only happens when the moneyed classes think they are going to profit from it.","Man is the only creature that consumes without producing. He does not give milk, he does not lay eggs, he is too weak to pull the plough, he cannot run fast enough to catch rabbits. Yet he is lord of all the animals.","Political chaos is connected with the decay of language... one can probably bring about some improvement by starting at the verbal end.","Serious sport is war minus the shooting.","A tragic situation exists precisely when virtue does not triumph but when it is still felt that man is nobler than the forces which destroy him.","Prolonged, indiscriminate reviewing of books is a quite exceptionally thankless, irritating and exhausting job. It not only involves praising trash but constantly inventing reactions towards books about which one has no spontaneous feeling whatever.","The best books... are those that tell you what you know already.","Most people get a fair amount of fun out of their lives, but on balance life is suffering, and only the very young or the very foolish imagine otherwise.","Those who 'abjure' violence can do so only because others are committing violence on their behalf.","The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labor.","No one can look back on his schooldays and say with truth that they were altogether unhappy.","I sometimes think that the price of liberty is not so much eternal vigilance as eternal dirt.","War is war. The only good human being is a dead one.","We may find in the long run that tinned food is a deadlier weapon than the machine-gun.","Whatever is funny is subversive, every joke is ultimately a custard pie... a dirty joke is a sort of mental rebellion.","The Catholic and the Communist are alike in assuming that an opponent cannot be both honest and intelligent.","It is almost universally felt that when we call a country democratic we are praising it; consequently, the defenders of every kind of regime claim that it is a democracy, and fear that they might have to stop using the word if it were tied down to any one meaning.","Probably the battle of Waterloo was won on the playing-fields of Eton, but the opening battles of all subsequent wars have been lost there.","War is a way of shattering to pieces... materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable and... too intelligent.","As I write, highly civilized human beings are flying overhead, trying to kill me.","One cannot really be a Catholic and grown up.","Four legs good, two legs bad.","It is also true that one can write nothing readable unless one constantly struggles to efface one's own personality. Good prose is like a windowpane.","Saints should always be judged guilty until they are proved innocent.","War is evil, but it is often the lesser evil.","A dirty joke is a sort of mental rebellion.","If you have embraced a creed which appears to be free from the ordinary dirtiness of politics - a creed from which you yourself cannot expect to draw any material advantage - surely that proves that you are in the right?","To an ordinary human being, love means nothing if it does not mean loving some people more than others.","A family with the wrong members in control; that, perhaps, is as near as one can come to describing England in a phrase.","He was an embittered atheist, the sort of atheist who does not so much disbelieve in God as personally dislike Him.","I doubt whether classical education ever has been or can be successfully carried out without corporal punishment.","One can love a child, perhaps, more deeply than one can love another adult, but it is rash to assume that the child feels any love in return.","Part of the reason for the ugliness of adults, in a child's eyes, is that the child is usually looking upwards, and few faces are at their best when seen from below.","For a creative writer possession of the 'truth' is less important than emotional sincerity.","At fifty everyone has the face he deserves.","The atmosphere of orthodoxy is always damaging to prose, and above all it is completely ruinous to the novel, the most anarchical of all forms of literature.","Dickens is one of those authors who are well worth stealing.","On the whole, human beings want to be good, but not too good, and not quite all the time.","Joyce is a poet and also an elephantine pedant.","When it comes to the pinch, human beings are heroic.","Society has always to demand a little more from human beings than it will get in practice.","There is hardly such a thing as a war in which it makes no difference who wins. Nearly always one side stands more or less for progress, the other side more or less for reaction.","Enlightened people seldom or never possess a sense of responsibility."],"George Osborne":["We must bring unity of spirit and purpose and condemn hatred and division wherever we see it.","The biggest single thing that has lifted people out of poverty is free trade.","Providing great schooling is the single most important thing we can do to help any child from a disadvantaged background succeed. It's also the single most important thing we can do to boost the long-term productivity of our economy.","Of all the public services, education is the one I'm most interested in. You get a more dynamic economy, you deal with most social problems, and it's morally right.","The Internet has made us richer, freer, connected and informed in ways its founders could not have dreamt of. It has also become a vector of attack, espionage, crime and harm.","I serve at the discretion of the prime minister.","To simply argue that public spending must always go up and never be cut is irresponsible.","What's important is that, come the general election, people think the right things of you. They think that you've got the right values and the right policies. And that you're the right kind of person to lead the country.","If we don't get a grip on government spending, there will be no growth.","I didn't come from a traditional Tory background; it was urban and metropolitan.","Everyone in our society has had to make a contribution towards dealing with the debts.","In football, as in politics, resilience pays off.","Most successful politicians don't let the job swamp their lives.","The police protect us, and we're going to protect the police.","A generous basic state pension is the least a civilized society should offer those who have worked hard and saved through their whole lives.","I want to see genuine talent rewarded.","Just as we should never balance the budget on the backs of the poor, so it is an economic delusion to think you can balance it only on the wallets of the rich.","I think people who sit around and are always yearning for the next thing are not always the happiest people.","The positive news is that the British economy is continuing to grow and is creating jobs. And it is positive news too that at a time of real international instability we are a safe haven in the storm.","The British people think that if someone is disabled, then they should get all the care and support that we can offer.","Well British pension funds have not been investing the savings of British people in British infrastructure.","I get a lot of letters from people.","We should be doing more business with China. We should be better connected to the Chinese economy.","Even as China's growth slows, it will continue to be a powerhouse for the global economy.","ISIL are already using the Internet for hideous propaganda purposes - for radicalisation, for operational planning, too.","Brexit is for the richest in our country: they can afford recessions.","Leaving the E.U. was not the outcome that I wanted or campaigned, but now that democracy has spoken, we must act on that result. I will fully respect that result.","Working people of this country want economic security. The worst possible thing you can do for those families is bust the public finances, have some welfare system this country can't afford.","Tony Blair was a good politician but not a good Prime Minister, and that's what we don't want to be. We don't want to be just people who are good at winning elections: we want to be good at governing. I think we benefit from having seen the mistakes that we think Tony Blair made in 1997.","I think the best solution to this challenge, and I accept there is a challenge with homophobic bullying, is to make sure we get rid of the bullying rather than feeling we have to take kids out of our schools and teach then somewhere else. That would be the best approach.","Unless they have disabilities to cope with, no family should get more from living on benefits than the average family gets from going out to work. No more open-ended chequebook.","The wish to pass something on to your children is about the most basic, human and natural aspiration there is.","They all said I was a very young guy. Well there is nothing I can do about that but with each day that passes the problem solves itself.","I had the closest thing I have ever had to an out-of-body experience lying in bed one morning.

I lay there thinking that's interesting, then I realised it was me.","Some things never change, suck up to the government and you get an honour.","You really have to try hard to create space and, at least for a time, stop the political world from rushing in. The important thing is to remain sane.","I believe that I'm entitled to regard my pre-political life as off-limits in terms of what can be looked at and judged.","I'm not going out to parties every night.","Autism is a very serious condition.","I understand the damage the expenses crisis has done to Parliament, and the paramount importance of restoring trust in our politics.","We need to think deeply about whether we can sustain banks that are not only too big to fail, but potentially too big to bail.","I think you can look at the British economy with confidence.","I have done everything I can to move Britain out of the financial danger zone.","Every day as Chancellor I see alerts telling me of risks around the world.","I believe in public services.","You cannot tackle Britain's debts without tackling the unreformed welfare system.","I think the British people have a strong sense of what is fair.","Cutting budget deficits can never be just an exercise in economics.","I want Britain to be the home of successful competitive and stable financial services.","Believe me, I understand that most higher rate taxpayers are not the super-rich.","Britain has no divine right to be one of the richest countries in the world.","The foundations of a strong economy don't rest alone on the decisions of Chancellors or the spending programmes of government.","The Conservative Party mustn't sound like the old man on the park bench who says things were better in 1985, or 1955, or 1855.","I think the British people are very, very attached to the idea that the health service is free at the point of use. But there is no reason why every doctor, nurse and teacher in this country has to be employed by the state.","I reject absolutely the idea that people should know their place, and know their class.","It's normally the kiss of death to be identified as a rising star, or someone to watch.","It's perfectly reasonable in a coalition between two political parties that you get supporters of those parties you know stressing the things they want to stress.","You know the illusion of the cheap money is over and now Britain has to go out there and graft and earn its way and create wealth and prosperity in a very competitive world.","I would say I have taken substantive action to make things easier for people.","Well can I just say unlike my predecessors, Conservative and Labour, I have set up an independent body that studies whether what I'm saying is true, whether I've met the targets that I set out.","Well you know I've attracted a lot of criticism by, for example, suggesting that child benefit should be taken away from higher rate taxpaying families.","I'm a Conservative who believes in lower taxes. They lead to a more enterprising economy. But I'm not somebody who believes you can fund lower taxes by borrowing more money.","Tax cuts should be for life, not just for Christmas.","There was a real fear that a euro-zone bank might fail, that we'd have a sovereign debt problem in one of the larger European economies. That's dissipated, thanks largely to the action of the European Central Bank.","In opposition, you move to the centre. In government, you move the centre.","If someone believes that living on benefits is a lifestyle choice, then we need to make them think again.","I support gay marriage. I support gay marriage because I believe Conservatives support the institutions of commitment.","The rise in world oil prices has been larger than anyone forecast.","I want Britain to be a global financial centre but I want it to be properly regulated.","I will listen to any argument put to me.","If you want to change the way your banking system is regulated, if you want to learn the mistakes of what's gone wrong, then you have to change your government.","I've learned to be true to yourself, stick to the big arguments, don't get distracted by the everyday kerfuffle that is in the nature of any democratic system.","The Conservative party, the modern Conservative party, is on the side of people who want to work hard and get on.","It's not easy cutting welfare bills. It's not easy cutting the deficit.","I think Britain can be one of the great success stories of the 21st century - we've got the talent, the drive, the connections around the world. But if we vote to Leave, then we lose control. We lose control of our economy, and if you lose control of your economy you lose control of everything. That's not a price worth paying.","If we leave the European Union it's a risk to our economy - it's a risk to pensioners, it's a risk to homeowners, it's a risk to people in work.","Every day, I genuinely count my blessings. One of the greatest things in life is to do a job you really enjoy.","I don't want to watch 'Newsnight.' I just don't understand those politicians who genuinely want to watch it for pleasure.","I want to see families with lower energy bills.","I think its important, particularly when you've got young children, to spend some time with them.","Politics as a parent is fairly demanding; if your parent is in politics, it's fairly demanding, so I make no excuses about taking two weeks off.","One thing I learned about Gordon Brown is you've got to have the strength to just get in there and take him on. When you first hear him spouting his statistics and boasting about his record, it can be quite intimidating. But over time, shadowing him, I just realised that a lot of it was rubbish; a lot of it was baloney.","I first started going to Chelsea games in the mid-Nineties when I lived off the North End Road, ten minutes' walk from Stamford Bridge.","One of London's massive strengths is its sporting prowess, its great football teams.","I want London to be the global sporting capital.","Our message to China is very clear: we want the U.K. to be China's best partner in the West.","We don't see a choice between securing growth and investment and raising human rights issues.","The Internet - central to modern life - provides new ways for our enemies to plan and act against us.","The threat from terrorists - from extreme ideologies - needs to be challenged head-on.","Britain can only spend what it can afford.","People should know this of me: I will do what is required to keep our country safe and secure because, in the end, that is what people's livelihoods and jobs rely on.","There are always ways to make government better, always ways to make sure that the taxes of people are better spent.","For families flying out of the U.K. for a winter getaway, airports should be the ideal place to pick up a bargain.","No ifs, no buts - we will not share the pound if Scotland separates from the U.K.","It's in our interests that the euro is a successful, strong currency.","If the E.U. allows itself to be priced out of the world economy, the next generation will not get jobs, living standards will decline, and the Union will lose the popular consent of the people of Europe.","If freedom of movement is to be sustainable, then our publics must see it as freedom to move to work, rather than freedom to choose the most generous benefits.","Britain needs a tough, strong financial conduct regulator.","We have accepted there is a big role for government to create a framework where businesses can grow in all parts of the country.","Britain has always been a home to the vulnerable, and we've always done what we need to do to help people who are fleeing persecution.","Our long-term economic plan is all about creating jobs and the economic security that comes with that.","Rather than standing back and being left behind, we must make the most of the opportunities that a growing China presents to us here in Britain.","The message I would say to China is, 'Carry on with the reform; carry on with the change you are making.'","We are very supportive of the economic reforms that the Chinese government have talked about.","Britain helped create the Internet - Tim Berners Lee created the World Wide Web, one of a long line of British scientists who have given us an outsized role in shaping our own digital future.","When I was born, the Internet was barely two years old. It was the preserve of academics, used to connect dozens rather than billions of users. There weren't many who predicted it would transform our world.","Nuclear power is cost-competitive with other low-carbon technology and is a crucial part of our energy mix, along with new sources of power such as shale gas.","Only the U.K. can trigger Article 50. And in my judgement, we should only do that when there is a clear view about what new arrangements we are seeking with our European neighbours.","I'm not one of those who thinks there is something inherently bad or inferior about watching television.","I can't imagine a God who would ever need to intercede in the daily travails of my life.","We are absolutely going to have to provide fiscal security to people; in other words, we are going to have to show the country and the world that the country can live within its means.","I'm a very happy, content member of David Cameron's team. I fought very hard to get my friend elected as leader of the Conservative party, then elected as the prime minister of this country, and I'm very happy being part of that team that is bringing change to this country.","There were some who wanted all the benefits of E.U. membership without any of the costs. I'm not sure that's very realistic.","Did I want Britain to remain in the E.U.? Yes. Did I fear the consequences if we quit? Yes. Did I argue passionately for that during the referendum? Absolutely I did.","Britain can choose, as others are, short term fixes and more stimulus. Or we can lead the world with long-term solutions to long-term problems.","The Office for Budget Responsibility correctly stay out of the political debate and do not assess the long-term costs and benefits of E.U. membership.","Many retailers have complained bitterly to me about the complexity of the Carbon Reduction Commitment. It's not a commitment; it's a tax.","It was the Conservatives who first protected people in the mills.","Sound public finances are not the enemy of sustained growth - they are its precondition.","Frankly, people buying a home to let should not be squeezing out families who can't afford a home to buy.","It's difficult to see how Syria can have any long-term future with Assad there as president. Many people would never return to that country if that were the case.","If we leave the European Union, there will be an immediate economic shock that will hit financial markets. People will not know what the future looks like.","We are not quitters. Britain has always gone out there; we have probably been more influential than any other country in shaping our world and the way it has thought about itself, the way we interact as nations.","If the country's poorer, it's got less money.","I do not want Britain to turn its back on Europe or the rest of the world.","I fought passionately to remain in the E.U., and I warned of the economic risks if we left the E.U.","There is lots of evidence that it is this fear of going into debt that most puts people from poorer backgrounds off going to university.","The former pension minister, the Liberal Democrat Steve Webb said I was trying to abolish the lump sum. Instead, we are going to keep the lump sum and abolish the Liberal Democrats.","To all companies large and small, I would say this: the British economy is fundamentally strong; we are highly competitive, and we are open for business.","Britain is an open and tolerant country, and I will fight with everything I have to keep it so.","The Conservative party is at its strongest when it's not the party that says there is no role for government and the state should just get out of the way. That is not a strand of Conservative thinking that, by itself, is enough.","We need strength and success elsewhere in our country - not by pulling London down but by building the rest of the country up.","The Conservative party absolutely must not allow itself to be shut out of parts of the north of England.","I've always thought that good politics follows from good economics and good policies.","Of course the Liberal Democrats are going to say things to try and get attention - but I don't think the country is paying much attention.","Margaret Thatcher's government redistributed money from rich to poor. And that's the nature of a modern western democracy.","It's not enough to tackle just the symptoms of poverty. You have to tackle the causes of poverty.","I am a social liberal.","I'm tempted to say that Conservative governments are normally elected to clear up the mess left by Labour governments.","I came into politics partly because I want to be able to reduce taxes so that individuals have more of their money to spend, so that businesses have more of their money to create jobs, but I believe that lower taxes are sustainable when you get the public finances in order, so I will only make promises I can keep on taxation."],"George P. Shultz":["I want my grandchildren to be proud of me. That's the main thing.","The source of all the energy is the sun. The big challenge is, how do you use all of that energy? Solar power has to fascinate you. There have been strides to get the costs down, and if this will work, you have to get costs down so it is competitive with fossil fuels.","The higher the classification of secrecy, the quicker you will report it.","You don't get gushers of revenue by raising tax rates. You get it through expansion.","I learned in business that you had to be very careful when you told somebody that's working for you to do something, because the chances were very high he'd do it. In government, you don't have to worry about that.","Oh, you know. I am secretary of state. My trips aren't successful. I just talk to people.","It was an attempt to stick the Congress's finger in King Hussein's eye.","Nothing ever gets settled in this town. a seething debating society in which the debate never stops, in which people never give up, including me. And so that's the atmosphere in which you administer.","You've got to dream a little bit if you're going to get somewhere.","The 1986 tax act is sort of the unsung hero of the very good economic times we had for a long time. Of course, politics gums it all up again and preferences get put in.","Obama seems to want to do something to damage rich people.","If you ask me what am I, I might say 'I am a Californian,' and if George Bush were here, he would say 'I am a Texan.'","There is no prospect that the United States will say to Israel, 'You do such and such and we'll not support you in your security.'","My experience is that if the military didn't want to use force and was confronted with a president that did, the military would come back with what I would call the 'bomb Moscow' scenario. They would say it had to be done with conditions that were so extreme, you obviously wouldn't do it.","I think the idea that you would do everything you can to prevent what is coming at you by way of something very disruptive - a 9/11 - it's a no-brainer.","I don't know how you define 'neoconservatism,' but I think it's associated with trying to spread open political systems and democracy.","Between 1980 and 1990, the number of countries that were classified as 'free' or 'mostly free' increased by about 50%.","Open political and economic systems have been gaining ground and there's a good reason for it. They work better.","We have struggled with terrorism for a long time. In the Reagan administration, I was a hawk on the subject. I said terrorism is a big problem, a different problem, and we have to take forceful action against it. Fortunately, Ronald Reagan agreed with me, but not many others did.","Terrorism is not a matter that can be left to law enforcement, with its deliberative process, built-in delays, and safeguards that may let the prisoner go free on procedural grounds.","Increasingly, the state system has been eroding. Terrorists have exploited this weakness by burrowing into the state system in order to attack it.","The civilized world has a common stake in defeating the terrorists.","The armed forces are paying a lot more attention to the use of energy. The Air Force has realized that the paint on planes is heavy, so there are going to be a lot more silver planes, or planes painted in a less heavy way, so that you are using less fuel to get from point A to point B.","What we want is scientists who don't become part of the policy discussion: All they do is produce science. If someone becomes an advocate, then I won't pay as much attention to their science.","I've always tried to live in the future and think about things and how to make things better. If you have great-grandchildren around, and their pictures are looking at you, well, that's the future.","Strong growth means increased use of energy at a pace that can strain the capacity to supply what is needed at a reasonable price."],"George Packer":["It seems preposterous now, but Amazon began as a bookstore.","Whether as victim, demon, or hero, the industrial worker of the past century filled the public imagination in books, movies, news stories, and even popular songs, putting a grimy human face on capitalism while dramatizing the social changes and conflicts it brought.","Al Qaeda asks its recruits to establish their bona fides as a condition of membership, even requiring answers to a long questionnaire. But ISIS has democratized and globalized jihad by lowering the entry bar to an eve-of-destruction YouTube pledge of allegiance to the caliphate - and even that could probably be waived.","I thought Obama was in a position to do some things. I thought 2008 was a turning point in history, with him and the Wall Street crash happening at the same time, but you just learn that those entrenched powers were really entrenched; those decayed institutions were really decayed.","Climate change joined immigration, job creation, food safety, pilot training, veterans' care, campaign finance, transportation security, labor law, mine safety, wildfire management, and scores of executive and judicial appointments on the list of matters that the world's greatest deliberative body is incapable of addressing.","A great writer requires a great biography, and a great biography must tell the truth.","The phrase 'change the world' is tossed around Silicon Valley conversations and business plans as freely as talk of 'early-stage investing' and 'beta tests.'","Amazon's identity and goals are never clear and always fluid, which makes the company destabilizing and intimidating.","Inequality saps the economy by draining the buying power of Americans whose incomes have stagnated, forcing them to rely on debt to fund education, housing, and health care.","Inspiration is an underexamined part of political life and presidential leadership.","Pay attention to other people's nightmares because they might be contagious.","Trump has seized the Republican nomination by finding scapegoats for the economic hardships and disintegrating lives of working-class whites while giving these voters a reassuring but false promise of their restoration to the center of American life.","Foreign policy exactly suits Obama's strong points as a leader, which turn out not to be giving the masses a clear sense of direction and hope, but instead exercising good judgment on a case-by-case basis while thinking many steps ahead of the present moment.","Before Google, and long before Facebook, Bezos had realized that the greatest value of an online company lay in the consumer data it collected.","The Princeton economist Alan Krueger has demonstrated that societies with higher levels of income inequality are societies with lower levels of social mobility.","It's - the working class of San Francisco and the Bay Area is being pushed out of its old neighborhoods because of the skyrocketing cost of housing, and there's no real working class left because these are jobs for engineers and managers and designers - very smart people.","I've read a lot of war writing, even World War I writing, the British war poetry of Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon, Robert Graves's memoir 'Goodbye to All That,' and a civilian memoir, 'Testament of Youth,' by Vera Brittain.","We have at least learned that the offspring of presidents don't necessarily make good politicians themselves.","Often, foreign policy - which, by definition, is largely out of American control - is simply a matter of not doing the wrong thing, the unwise thing.","Walmart's period of explosive growth coincided with decades of wage stagnation and deindustrialization. By applying relentless downward pressure on prices and wages, the company came to dominate both consumer spending and employment in small towns and rural areas across the middle of the country.","The base of the party, the middle-aged white working class, has suffered at least as much as any demographic group because of globalization, low-wage immigrant labor, and free trade. Trump sensed the rage that flared from this pain and made it the fuel of his campaign.","The information age has made Thiel rich, but it has also been a disappointment to him. It hasn't created enough jobs, and it hasn't produced revolutionary improvements in manufacturing and productivity. The creation of virtual worlds turns out to be no substitute for advances in the physical world.","Oprah is just this goddess presiding over so much of American life, and her story is really interesting - the way she made herself, and the ruthlessness it took, and also the fantasizing that it took.","It's essential for the U.S. and Europe to prevent Putin from going farther and reversing the hard-won independence of former Soviet republics.","Putin stands for the opposite of a universal ideology; he has become an arch-nationalist of a pre-Cold War type, making mystic appeals to motherland and religion.","The invisibility of work and workers in the digital age is as consequential as the rise of the assembly line and, later, the service economy.","With work increasingly invisible, it's much harder to grasp the human effects, the social contours, of the Internet economy.","Today, we have our own concentrations of economic power. Instead of Standard Oil, U.S. Steel, the Union Pacific Railroad, and J. P. Morgan and Company, we have Amazon, Google, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft.","To many book professionals, Amazon is a ruthless predator. The company claims to want a more literate world - and it came along when the book world was in distress, offering a vital new source of sales.","I actually think that self-interest is overrated as an all-purpose guide to political motive. It leaves out something at least as powerful and immovable - individual psychology.","Gingrich was a far more volatile and aggressive individual than Boehner, but the institutional norms of self-restraint, and perhaps even self-interest, have broken down under the pressure of an increasingly abnormal Republican Party.","What the Web has never figured out is how to pay for reporting, which, with the collapse of print newspapers, is in desperately short supply, and without which even the most prolific commenters will someday run out of things to say.","Surrendering to jargon is a sign of journalism's dismal lack of self-confidence in the optimized age of content-management systems.","Everything seems set up for success in digital journalism - money, eyeballs, software, brands.","While starving refugees in Homs were providing target practice for government snipers, Bashar al-Assad's strongest international backer was in Sochi, at the Iceberg Skating Palace, visibly moved, smiling with deep satisfaction, as the Russians beautifully glided and leaped their way to the gold medal in the team event.","Much of the international unease with the Sochi Games has focused on the threat of terrorism, Putin's domestic repressiveness, and the Russian campaign of anti-gay propaganda.","No one pretends anymore that the Olympics are just about sports. It's routine to talk about what effect holding the Games in this or that capital will have on the host country's international reputation, how a nation's prestige can be raised by its medal count.","Character is destiny, and politicians usually get the scandals they deserve, with a sense of inevitability about them.","I've been interested in American politics since I was eight. That was in 1968. It was an interesting year. I was a huge Eugene McCarthy supporter, so I guess he was the first senator I really knew about and cared about.","The Senate was an odd compromise between the founders and the early leaders of the republic who wanted a single house which was based on popular sovereignty representing the people and those founders who wanted two houses, the upper house, the Senate, being the more aristocratic.","It's a cliche that the Senate is broken, and like most cliches, it's true.","Too many talented and supremely calculating politicians, including Nixon and Clinton, have destroyed their careers, or come close, by acting in ways that were obviously against their own interests.","It might not be wise for a sometime political journalist to admit this, but the 2016 campaign doesn't seem like fun to me.","As America has grown less economically equal, a citizen's ability to move upward has fallen behind that of citizens in other Western democracies. We are no longer the country where anyone can become anything.","America's vast population of working poor can only get so poor before even Walmart is out of reach.","How a candidate runs shapes how a president governs.","I am never going to be able to rest easy in having established a posthumous connection to my father. I'll always be groping for what I can't have.","'The Assassins' Gate' is a very tightly controlled story of the ideas that led to the war and the consequences of those ideas in Iraq, and there is no doubt about where it is going and what kind of groundwork is being laid.","If you've ever left a bag of clothes outside the Salvation Army or given to a local church drive, chances are that you've dressed an African.","All over Africa, people are wearing what Americans once wore and no longer want. Visit the continent, and you'll find faded remnants of secondhand clothing in the strangest of places.","What I found in Silicon Valley is an industry that's sort of been kept a very far remove from Washington and had an attitude of 'Just let us do our thing and make the miracles that people love around the world and leave us alone.'","Mark Zuckerberg has started an advocacy group for immigration reform.","The next great technology revolution might be around the corner, but it won't automatically improve most people's lives. That will depend on politics, which is indeed ugly but also inescapable.","Everyone finds justification for his or her views in logic and analysis, but a personal philosophy often emerges from some archaic part of the mind, an early idea of how the world should be.","The libertarian worship of individual freedom, and contempt for social convention, comes easiest to people who have never really had to grow up.","What can one man do even if he is the president?","Even while writing about foreign places, I have been in a way writing about America, because that's the subject that interests me the most. I'm attached to it, critical, but it's definitely my country, and maybe even more so when I'm overseas.","Jay-Z is a hero, Sam Walton is a hero - these are not exactly communitarian champions. These are - in some cases, literally; in others, just figuratively - gangster heroes. That's who is worshipped: people who get away with it.","Every movement, to stay alive - a very difficult thing to do historically - has to find a way to harness that initial surge of emotion and turn it to the hard, steady, un-sexy work of recruiting new members, strategizing, negotiating with those in power, keeping itself going.","The similarities are limited but real. They amount to a shared disgust with politics as usual in America. The Tea Party focuses on the federal government; Occupy Wall Street focuses on corporate America and its influence over the government.","I have my sympathies and also my critical views, and they aren't much of a secret, but my first job is to see and hear and think about what I've seen and heard.","I think the mix of narrative and analysis that the 'New Yorker' requires is a perfect expression of what my parents each gave me.","I am not a pure fiction writer, nor am I an academic writer. Somehow I ended up in this blended area of literary journalism.","So many writers grew up in tortured isolation, in revolt against their families. I and my sister were in a house where writing was considered the worthiest thing you could try to do.","For 20 years, my mother, my sister and I had seldom spoken of my father. If he happened to come up in conversation, pain and embarrassment entered the room and stayed until he disappeared back into the silence with which we all felt more at ease.","I don't know if it's a male thing, but I've always been interested in how people respond to the stresses and dangers of war, how they react under fire.","In the extremity of war, character is revealed.","When I interviewed Paul Bremer in his office, he had almost no books on his shelves. He had a couple of management books, like 'Leadership' by Rudolph Giuliani. I didn't take it as an encouraging sign.","Partly what I'm writing about is the way taboos get toppled.","Jay-Z has kind of shown that you can get to the very top without waiting, without following rules. In fact, it's better if you don't. People will admire you more if you break the rules.","Politics demands certain skills honed by experience, just as journalism does, just as acting does.","In a meritocracy, actors who act well get good roles. They don't get to be journalists, too - a job that, in a meritocracy, should go to those who do journalism well.","Obama is the splendid fruit of a meritocracy.","Millions don't rally to the banner of Uncertainty.","Ambition, of course, is the politician's currency.","Obama offers himself as a catalyst by which disenchanted Americans can overcome two decades of vicious partisanship, energize our democracy, and restore faith in government.","In its lowest, most common form, inspiration is simple charisma that becomes magnified by the media, as with Ronald Reagan or Bill Clinton.","The idea of solving as huge and long-term a problem as inequality - which, for my money, is the biggest single problem we have here at home - just never gets serious concern from both sides.","The Olympics are never just about sports.","If giving money to a politician prejudiced my ability to think and write honestly, I wouldn't do it. Fortunately, it doesn't.","My readers know my views on politics and politicians because I make no secret of them in my comments for 'The New Yorker' and elsewhere.","The best example of Obama's success in foreign policy is Iran.","Americans almost never elect presidents on the basis of foreign policy.","I spend much too much time on the Web with e-mail and surfing and reading my key sites, and a whole day can go by, and you wonder, 'What did I do today?'","That's why I'm not on Twitter and don't have an iPhone. It's not because I'm superior to it: it's because I would be a slave to it, and I don't want that to happen.","I need to protect myself from my own addictive impulse.","Last year, in the year 2008, it just became normal to watch great American institutions crumble, almost dissolve like sand.","The war in Afghanistan is not of a peace with the rest of Obama's worldview. It's a holdover from the era that his election was supposed to bring to a close.","The difference between a reporter, a newspaper columnist, a paid speaker, a television personality, a radio talk show host, a blogger, a movie producer, a publicist, and a political strategist, is growing less - and not more - distinct.","I worked as a carpenter for a few years. I began writing. I wrote a book about my time in Africa - that came out in 1988 - called 'The Village of Waiting.'","The Iraq war was always a long shot. But it was made immeasurably longer by its principal architects in Washington, including Douglas Feith, who ignored expert advice, reserved most of their effort for fighting each other in ideological battles, and regarded the Iraqi people as an afterthought.","The hollowing out of the heartland was good for Walmart's bottom line: its slogan might have been an amoral maxim attributed to Lenin - 'The worse, the better.'","Together, Apple and Walmart represent the intense separation of American life into blue and red, rich and poor, overpriced and undersold, hyperconnected and left behind.","Part of the mystique of blogs is their protean quality: They work both sides of the divide between politics and media, further blurring the already fuzzy distinctions between reporter, pundit, political operative, activist, and citizen.","The constellation of opinion called the blogosphere consists, like the stars themselves, partly of gases. This is what makes blogs addictive - that is, both pleasurable and destructive: They're so easy to consume and so endlessly available.","A curious thing about this rarefied world is that bloggers are almost unfailingly contemptuous toward everyone except one another.","Over the years, America had become more like Wal-Mart. It had gotten cheap. Prices were lower, and wages were lower. There were fewer union factory jobs and more part-time jobs as greeters.","By the fall of 2007, my last remaining Iraqi friend in Baghdad had left. Once he was gone, my connection to the country and the war began to thin, even as the terror diminished. I missed the improvement that came with the surge, and so, in my nervous system, I never quite registered it.","On foreign policy, Obama has talked softly and carried a big stick.","American wars in Muslim countries created some extremists and inflamed many more while producing a security vacuum that allowed them to wreak mayhem.","Abstract sympathy with the working class as an economic entity is easy, but the feeling can vanish on contact with actual members of the group, who often arrive with disturbing beliefs and powerful resentments - who might not sound or look like people urban progressives want to know.","White male privilege remains alive in America, but the phrase would seem odd, if not infuriating, to a sixty-year-old man working as a Walmart greeter in southern Ohio.","A religion is not just a set of texts but the living beliefs and practices of its adherents.","'Charlie Hebdo' had been nondenominational in its satire, sticking its finger into the sensitivities of Jews and Christians, too - but only Muslims responded with threats and acts of terrorism.","The reformocons court right-wing censure simply by acknowledging that the middle class is under pressure and that government has a role to play beyond cutting taxes.","Republicans today have given the country conservatism in the spirit of Sarah Palin, whose ignorance about the world, contempt for expertise, and raw appeals to white identity politics presaged Trump's incendiary campaign.","WikiLeaks is not a news organization; it is a cell of activists that is releasing information designed to embarrass people in power.","Discerning the legal difference between what WikiLeaks did and what news organizations do is difficult and would set a terrible precedent.","I don't think they need to be nice to reporters, but the White House seems to imagine that releasing information is like a tap that can be turned on and off at their whim.","It seems in America you are stuck with the position you adopted, even when events change, in order to claim absolute consistency. That can't be good.","No-one can say when the unwinding began, when the coil that held America together in its secure and sometime shifting grip first gave way.","Lawyers, judges, doctors, shrinks, accountants, investigators and, not least, journalists could not do the most basic tasks without a veil of secrecy. Why shouldn't the same be true of those professionals who happen to be government officials?","It suddenly occurred to me that the hottest tech startups are solving all the problems of being 20 years old, with cash on hand, because that's who thinks them up.","Certain murderous ideas are in the air worldwide, and they are finding individuals in scattered places in different ways, and every attack spreads them further, plants an idea in a new head.","Liberal democracies like ours seem, for the most part, to have learned how to avoid meticulously planned mass-casualty plots with the complexity and scale of 9/11. But they don't know how to keep their citizens safe at night clubs and concerts, in supermarkets, on beachfront promenades, from truck drivers.","Afghanistan can't police its borders, and its neighbors give sanctuary and assistance to insurgents.","If the presidential nominating process were an international sports competition, one would assume that top officials of both parties were taking envelopes of cash from town chairs in Durham and precinct captains in Waterloo."],"George Papandreou":["The Marshall Plan was after destruction, and the U.S. came to our help and obviously this was very, very important for the future of Europe. I think now we have all the capabilities of doing it on our own and, in a sense, we have to.","Unfortunately, corruption is widespread in government agencies and public enterprises. Our political system promotes nepotism and wasting money. This has undermined our legal system and confidence in the functioning of the state. One of the consequences is that many citizens don't pay their taxes.","We are on a difficult course, on a new Odyssey for Greece, but we know the road to Ithaca and have charted the waters.","I would like to see Greece as a case study, an opportunity for Europe to strengthen its coordination of fiscal policy.","The fact that we're going through a crisis is an opportunity for Europe to be more coordinated and more integrated. We're actually talking about a European Monetary Fund or euro bonds, about guarantees for countries, about economic governance in the European Union. That shows the strength of Europe.","First of all, Greece won't go down. We're talking about a country that is capable of making change. Europe will not allow the destabilization of the 27-country euro zone. But if there were no action, then markets would start becoming jittery about other countries - and not only Spain and Portugal, but other countries in the European Union.","We stand united, facing the big responsibility to change our country into a nation of justice, solidarity, humanity and green development.","There is this concept of politics as a dirty game. It's a difficult game, but it doesn't have to be dirty. I think this is what we need to bring to politics. I think politics around the world has very often been captured by big interests - 'lobbies' they call them in the States.","If we had a consensus we wouldn't have to go to a referendum.","There are certain moments in the history of a nation when the choices made define the decades to come.","People would say you look weak if you're not cursing the opposition and driving around in a big black car while always wearing a tie. Above all, to be 'strong' you're always supposed to be giving orders.","I think there is a heritage which I'm proud of, which is a fight for democracy, a fight for social justice, a fight for freedom. My grandfather went to jail or exile six times in his life, fighting for his principles for democracy, or for his country. And my father twice.","I never thought about becoming a politician. But during the military dictatorship, my grandfather was put in prison six times and my father twice. If my family and my country didn't have this history, I might be a professor somewhere today.","You can theorise about the options you have but in reality they are very specific.","This idea that you're a successful tough guy if you evade taxes and deceive the state has got to change.","We're very proud to be part of the eurozone. But this comes with obligations and it is crucial we show the world we can live up to those obligations.","Everyone needs to carry out his own personal revolution.","If Greece had gone through a very normal political life, I may have not been in politics. But just the fact that I lived through huge upheavals and very difficult struggles and polarization and the barbarism of dictatorships - that made me feel that we had to change this country.","Greece has given Europe the opportunity to fix a defect in the euro zone, that is the fact that we did not have a fiscal union. Now steps have been taken to begin that process. And there is more solidarity from nation to nation, and that is a good thing. That has been Greece's gift to Europe.","It is important that the Greek people make decisions on important developments.","Today I want to send a message of optismism to all Greeks. Our road, our path, will be more stabilised. Our country will be in a better situation. We will be stronger.","As long as I feel I am doing what I think is right and just for my country, for the Greek people, that is enough for me. Saving Greece from this crisis was the first thing on the agenda. We are now on a much more normalised road.","When I was growing up in the United States and Sweden, I never thought about becoming a politician.","Politics also means educating people. It's important to speak openly with our fellow Greeks, to tell them what our problems are and that we have to change something.","I am proud of being a Greek of the diaspora.","There is this concept of politics as a dirty game.","Already people are saying we do need a change.","Europe has a lot of strength. We need to pool that strength, and I am very much in favour of that - more of a deeper political union.","I never thought of politics as a profession.","We are a country with great potential. We have the political will to make deep changes in a just and equitable way, to put our country back on a development path, to meet the challenges of a new world.","I will always be upfront with the Greek people, so we can solve the country's problems together.","Previous governments, particularly the one before I took over, mismanaged the economy quite badly.","We had about 60 regions in Greece and now there are only 13. It'd be like cutting down 50 states to 13 and making it more efficient.","I have been supporting the European Union, but we are still a work in progress. We have to become more of a United States of Europe. We should talk about electing a president of the E.U., rather than having one selected from the heads of government.","But sovereign debt is a wider question not only in Europe but across the globe. While every country is a unique case, I think it's not an issue of countries acting on their own. We need a more coordinated strategy not only in Europe but around the world.","At times of distress, we all like to recall the advice of fathers and mothers. The best advice my father gave me was to keep faith and deep confidence in the potential of the Greek people; nurture the belief that they can do things.","My hope is that we will turn Greece into maybe the most transparent country in the world with everything on the web.","I have always said I will be in politics to serve as best as I can and it will take me wherever it will take me.","I have a deep sense of responsibility to my country and Greek people.","I would say we are a friend in need and I am sure that the Greek people would very much welcome the choice of the British people to come and enjoy Greece, first of all, but also that would be a sign of support.","Markets are saying pretty much what I'm saying too: that Greece is doing what it can, but that Greece is not going to be able to carry the weight of all of Europe and the other problems that Europe has.","Europe is a strong market for the U.S. If it has problems, if there's a lack of consumer confidence, if there's a deeper recession, this will deeply affect jobs in the U.S.","Many people have been pontificating, and patronizing, and moralizing, and scapegoating, saying you Greeks, you are the problem. I would say we Greeks have a problem. We are not the problem.","If we were the problem, it would be very convenient - kick Greece out, everything's fine. What would happen to Spain, what about Portugal, what about Italy, what about the whole of the euro zone? We need more cooperation and less simplification and prejudice.","We Greeks want change. We know there are problems in our system. We have great potential but we need to manage our country well. Now that hasn't been done over the last decades. And that is, of course, what we are paying for.","The Greek people do not want to exit the euro. And I believe the Greek people already have shown that they have made major sacrifices to stay in the euro zone.","How can a parliamentarian or a leader in a country say, on the one hand, that we're going to support Greece but at the same time say that Greeks are lazy?","In ancient Greece, politics and the market were not decoupled.","Every leader wants to put his or her imprint on the work that they do, and grow up in specific eras.","The structures in Europe in a globalising economy need to be modernised, need to be more integrated, need to be stronger.","The more there is a European solution to a theoretical, but possible, problem in the markets, the less we will have to talk about an I.M.F. solution.","Despite the deep reforms we are making, traders and speculators have forced interest rates on Greek bonds to record highs.","Countries are not like financial markets. Social change cannot be executed as swiftly as credit-default swaps. You cannot sell short on social commitments and practical responsibilities.","The unemployed in Greece can get a voucher and choose a training program somewhere in Europe to be retrained during this crisis and when this crisis is over, we make sure that that person hasn't fallen off the cliff and can come back into the labor market with new skills to find a job.","We have a rise of extremism because we need to give a sense that we are targeting some of the deeper problems in Greece, the injustices.","We have made major reforms in Greece. When I took over after a landslide victory we had a mandate for change and I knew my major focus would be re-organizing the state.","Very often, people will come out and say, 'Greeks aren't doing things, Greeks aren't making changes, there's no reform,' That is hogwash. We have made a huge effort. The Greek people have made a huge effort.","Greece has great strengths, but much of this potential has been wasted. That's because of a wider political system, but also because of a lack of an institutional framework.","We in Europe have great capacities.","If you put all the European countries together, we are the biggest economy in the world.","Greece's history in the drachma was an up-and-down history, a roller coaster.","The real problem in Greece is not cutting taxes, it's making sure that we don't have tax evasion.","Markets themselves are looking for stability, and I think we have underestimated the capacity of Europe... to actually create a more stable framework for the whole issue of debt management, bonds, and so on.","If we were going to default, we would have decided that many months ago. It would be wrong for the Greek economy, it would be wrong for the European economy, it would make things worse in the end. That's why we're taking the pain and making these structural reforms, and we're on target."],"George Pataki":["This Budget reflects a choice - not an easy choice, but the right choice. And when you think about it, the only choice. The choice to take the responsible, prudent path to fiscal stability, economic growth and opportunity.","The expansion of tobacco cessation centers is an important part of our historic and continuing effort to help smokers quit. The expansion of these centers will give even more New Yorkers the help they need to quit once and for all.","First, how to memorialize the heroes of 9/11; second, something that expresses our resolve.","And one of the frustrating parts, but it's an inherent part of our democracy, is we have separation of powers.","For the first time federal, state and local bureaus of investigation are coordinating their effort, to serve as eyes and ears and protect us against further attacks.","We will emerge stronger as a diverse community; the area will be rebuilt with life around the clock, new buildings, restaurants, places of entertainment.","We can't just throw a switch and say Indian Point is going to be safe, we have to look long-term because it will ultimately be decommissioned and we have to work aggressively now to bring in new sources of power.","After September 11th, nations from across the globe offered their generous assistance to the people of New York. And whenever our friends around the world need our assistance, New York is there.","Let's make New York the safest state in America - that must be our goal. Let's achieve it together.","We know that when people are safe in their homes, they are free to pursue their dream for a brighter economic future for themselves and their families.","When government accepts responsibility for people, then people no longer take responsibility for themselves.","Israel has always been and must always be America's strongest ally.","Our decade of change has unleashed the ingenuity, creativity, and character of the most extraordinary people in the world - the people of this state, who come from every corner of the globe.","On that terrible day, a nation became a neighborhood. All Americans became New Yorkers.","There is no moral equivalency between those who would kill using children, innocent civilians, children and adults, in their homes and in their places of worship, to that of a government that is seeking those terrorists before they can engage in that awful activity.","The moral equation strongly tells everyone who understands freedom, who understands morality, that Israel is engaging in a just war in defense of its people and its freedom.","Israel is a country that respects freedom - freedom of assembly, freedom of speech and freedom of worship.","Well, I know I worked for Governor Rockefeller the last time he ran for his fourth term, and I obviously ran against Governor Cuomo the time he ran for his fourth term.","I'm thinking about governing as the governor of this state, and that's what I'm going to do.","I'm very proud of what we've done with the State University and the City University. They're totally different institutions than they were when I took office.","You know, there are some areas of the state that are providing enormous help to their students; there are others where they're not doing what they can.","But, you know, all I can do is submit my budget and then make the case to the Legislature to act.","I have tremendous admiration for everyone who enters the political arena so long as their goal is to do what they believe is right for the people of New York.","We passed important laws to give the authorities responsible for investigation wide powers to defend us.","We have a reliable computerized network devoted to counterterrorist activities.","After the tragedy, New Yorkers are more united than ever in their vision, as well as in appreciation what living in freedom means - and that if we stand together, we can accomplish anything.","We also have a program in place for low income people. A family of four making $26,000 a year can receive medical coverage, irrespective of citizenship or what documents.","If someone lives in New York, he's a New Yorker - they are entitled to the best medical system in the world.","We have been actively trying to have New York City host the 2012 Olympics.","Olympics is global competition in which eighty, ninety, hundred, hundred and ten countries participate.","We are going through tough economic times but things are looking up, and the indicators are improving not only for large corporations but also for small business.","It is a very real concern and my view is that everything changed on September 11th and the procedure, the policies that were in place prior to September 11th no longer should apply.","I think there are steps that can be taken that haven't been required or energy to make that fight more secure and we are going to continue to push the federal government to do that.","What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state. But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.","When I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together. We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.","Religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here. That is not protected free speech. That is not protected religious belief.","I have two sons. Both served. One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan. I do not see - want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night. I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary. But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.","I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.","I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better. I changed that.","When I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office, replacing dependency with opportunity.","You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science? Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb. And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.","I can govern by bringing people together. And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has. I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time. And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime."],"George Peppard":["You have problems, you think drink helps, then you have two problems.","The temporal quality of all things was being firmly impressed upon me.","From my point of view, there is a lot of joy in stage work.","I love to entertain an audience.","If they'll have me and the show does well, I could do this another two or three years.","It's not that I'm knocking the movie and television work.","There's always the new wrinkle. One must keep one's eyes always open.","Some people do better on their own. I don't."],"George Perez":["I always rate a convention by the lack of blisters from twiddling my thumbs.","I think one of the problems that comics has in dealing with superheroines is that they try to hard to make them superheroes. All they're doing is the same thing that men do. Just the idea that they're no different than men, except in how they look, always seemed a bit off to me.","The difference between Superman and Wonder Woman is not strength or power level or origin but the fact that she is a woman.","I grew up on comics in the 1960s era, when 'Wonder Woman' was rather silly. She was an interchangeable female character plagued by bad stereotypes. She cried at the drop of a hat, she was worried about how she looked, all of that.","When I did 'Wonder Woman,' I was especially proud that I had both a very large straight female and gay male following.","Pretty much all I ever expected out of comics was page rate. You could make money doing sketches at conventions, and that could supplement your income. But page rate and some supplement, maybe, was all I ever expected.","Because several 'Titans' characters have been used in video games, I've got royalty checks for six figures. And I had no knowledge of this until I opened the mailbox, because I don't follow the video game world!","Wonder Woman is most definitely a feminist, or a humanist, in no uncertain terms. Her prime goal in life is to teach peaceful coexistence and equality.","I've been drawing since I was five years old.","Looking back, my style was pretty much Marvel house style - very large, thick characters, very musclebound, not very flexible.","I can earn more in a single weekend of convetioneering than I would in an entire month drawing comics. And I get a pretty high rate drawing comics.","Fans are hungry for original artwork.","There are artists who make their living now going to conventions... because now you can.","One thing I'm particularly proud of is that a convention will usually ask me back for the next year, after I've only been at the show for a day or two, because of my rapport with the fans.","I have a fan base who are collectors.","Moonlight is my theater group. They are my home. I feel greatly appreciated there. That type of satisfaction, money can't buy.","It wasn't until I went to my first comic convention while I was in high school that I got to see actual comic book artists and original artwork in real life, up close. That was when I first realized that this is what I wanted to do for a living.","There was a time when I was 23 years old that I thought my career was over because I couldn't move my hand. It turned out it was just a pinched nerve.","I try to pay it forward. I do a lot of philanthropic and charity work. Some of my greatest awards, greatest rewards, have not been for comic work but for charity work.","One of the greatest joys of doing 'Comic Book Men' - I was so thankful - was that my wife Carol was able to appear with me. Being able to share that experience with Carol was such a monumental joy for me.","I find that using real people as models keeps me from getting too formulaic in the designs of characters.","While I've been well-known for trying to keep my fictional characters individual in their looks, it's an even greater challenge not only to make them individual but also identifiable.","I've been to hundreds of conventions in my career. Sometimes I'm afraid I may get jaded by them. But then, I see a figure in bright colors walking up to me, and I smile. I thank them for reminding me of just how lucky I am to do what I get the honor to do every day of my life.","Quite honestly, one of the unavoidable considerations in going exclusive with any company is being put on a company's medical insurance program.","To clarify the facts to everyone, yes, I did have a heart attack. I was on a plane leaving from Los Angeles, CA, heading to Secaucus, NJ, for a comic convention when I started to feel some discomfort in my chest.","I've had a great run and have been blessed not only with a great career, but also, thanks to all of you nice people buying video games, t-shirts, action figures, collected editions - and watching all those movies and TV shows - my royalty income allows me financial security for life.","Writing and drawing comics for the sheer joy of it - that's true bliss.","I'm often forced to draw a lot of tiny panels due to the limited number of pages and the complexity of the story.","To tell you the truth, while I do enjoy the grand-scale elements, it's the personal scenes, the character moments that I really find satisfying. That's where I get to delve into the characters' minds and hearts. That's where they become living, breathing beings to me.","Most of my best friends ended up being women, most notably my wife, and I learn a lot by simply listening.","No one will be hurt if I don't come to conventions.","If Trump's own words didn't convince you what a loathsome person he is, certainly nothing that I say or do will sway you."],"George Phillips Bond":["Until very recently, the heavenly bodies have been investigated only with reference to their position and their laws of motion, and a quarter of a century ago astronomy was little more than celestial topography.","Madam: If you discover any more comets, can you not wait until they are announced by the proper authorities?","I had planned to accomplish something considerable, and this is the end."],"George Pierce Baker":["What then is tragedy? In the Elizabethan period it was assumed that a play ending in death was a tragedy, but in recent years we have come to understand that to live on is sometimes far more tragic than death.","Rare is the human being, immature or mature, who has never felt an impulse to pretend he is some one or something else.","Farce treats the improbable as probable, the impossible as possible.","Acted drama requires surrender of one's self, sympathetic absorption in the play as it develops.","Back through the ages of barbarism and civilization, in all tongues, we find this instinctive pleasure in the imitative action that is the very essence of all drama.","But what is drama? Broadly speaking, it is whatever by imitative action rouses interest or gives pleasure.","Drama read to oneself is never drama at its best, and is not even drama as it should be.","In all the great periods of the drama perfect freedom of choice and subject, perfect freedom of individual treatment, and an audience eager to give itself to sympathetic listening, even if instruction be involved, have brought the great results.","In reading plays, however, it should always be remembered that any play, however great, loses much when not seen in action.","In the best farce today we start with some absurd premise as to character or situation, but if the premises be once granted we move logically enough to the ending.","No drama, however great, is entirely independent of the stage on which it is given.","Out of the past come the standards for judging the present; standards in turn to be shaped by the practice of present-day dramatists into broader standards for the next generation.","Sensitive, responsive, eagerly welcomed everywhere, the drama, holding the mirror up to nature, by laughter and by tears reveals to mankind the world of men.","The drama is a great revealer of life.","The instinct to impersonate produces the actor; the desire to provide pleasure by impersonations produces the playwright; the desire to provide this pleasure with adequate characterization and dialogue memorable in itself produces dramatic literature.","There is no essential difference between the material of comedy and tragedy. All depends on the point of view of the dramatist, which, by clever emphasis, he tries to make the point of view of his audience.","We do not kill the drama, we do not really limit its appeal by failing to encourage the best in it; but we do thereby foster the weakest and poorest elements.","When the drama attains a characterization which makes the play a revelation of human conduct and a dialogue which characterizes yet pleases for itself, we reach dramatic literature."],"George Plimpton":["He was interviewed in the early '60s by a young novelist, Pati Hill.","I remember being awed by it - the uniqueness and nicety of style - and I suspect I was a bit jealous because we were more or less of the same generation.","It is also one of the pleasures of oral biography, in that the reader, rather than editor, is jury.","My favorite monologue in the book is Kate Harrington's story of her relationship with Truman.","The New York Times published the guest list on the front page. The masks were a brilliant concept."],"George Porter":["I have no doubt that we will be successful in harnessing the sun's energy. If sunbeams were weapons of war, we would have had solar energy centuries ago.","It is not only my laboratory and my place of work but also my home, so that on the 30th October I was able to share my happiness immediately with my students and collaborators and, at the same time, with my wife and family.","Tonight I should like to thank all those who have shared my work and to acknowledge the debt that I owe to my wife whose encouragement to put research before all other things has been a great strength to me.","When the honour is given to that scientist personally the happiness is sweet indeed. Science is, on the whole, an informal activity, a life of shirt sleeves and coffee served in beakers."],"George R. R. Martin":["Nobody is a villain in their own story. We're all the heroes of our own stories.","I prefer to work with grey characters rather than black and white.","I have always regarded historical fiction and fantasy as sisters under the skin, two genres separated at birth.","I have files, I have computer files and, you know, files on paper. But most of it is really in my head. So God help me if anything ever happens to my head!","I knew that, when writing a book, you're not constrained by a budget. You're not constrained by what you can do, in terms of the special effects technology. You're not limited to any particular running time.","I've been many kinds of writers in my career: novelist; tele-playwright; short story writer. As a high-school student, I wrote amateur pieces for fanzines, and I've written for Hollywood.","As Faulkner says, all of us have the capacity in us for great good and for great evil, for love but also for hate. I wanted to write those kinds of complex character in a fantasy, and not just have all the good people get together to fight the bad guy.","It's really irritating when you open a book, and 10 pages into it you know that the hero you met on page one or two is gonna come through unscathed, because he's the hero. This is completely unreal, and I don't like it.","Fiction is lies; we're writing about people who never existed and events that never happened when we write fiction, whether its science fiction or fantasy or western mystery stories or so-called literary stories. All those things are essentially untrue. But it has to have a truth at the core of it.","I've always preferred writing about grey characters and human characters. Whether they are giants or elves or dwarves, or whatever they are, they're still human, and the human heart is still in conflict with the self.","Start with short stories. After all, if you were taking up rock climbing, you wouldn't start with Mount Everest. So if you're starting fantasy, don't start with a nine-book series.","There are writers, and I know some of them, who are very disciplined. Who write, like, four pages a day, every day. And it doesn't matter if their dog got run over by a car that day, or they won the Irish sweepstakes. I'm not one of those writers.","With a book I am the writer and I am also the director and I'm all of the actors and I'm the special effects guy and the lighting technician: I'm all of that. So if it's good or bad, it's all up to me.","I try to make the readers feel they've lived the events of the book. Just as you grieve if a friend is killed, you should grieve if a fictional character is killed. You should care. If somebody dies and you just go get more popcorn, it's a superficial experience isn't it?","I believe that a writer learns from every story he writes, and when you try different things, you learn different lessons. Working with other writers, as in Hollywood or in a shared world series, will also strengthen your skills, by exposing you to new ways of seeing the work, and different approaches to certain creative challenges.","I think in television and film, it's not usually the child's point of view. It's the story of an adult. If there's a child in a drama or an action-adventure movie, they're someone who needs to be saved, someone who needs to be protected, or if they're killed, someone who needs to be avenged. Their character doesn't matter much.","I've never been good with deadlines. My early novels, I wrote by myself. No one knew I was writing a novel; I didn't have a contract.","I like grey characters; fantasy for too long has been focused on very stereotypical heroes and villains.","I had this desire to see the world. I couldn't see any of it, but I saw it in my imagination, and that's why I always read books, and I could go to Mars or Middle Earth or the Hyborian age.","Don't write outlines; I hate outlines.","I have a huge emotional attachment to characters I've created, especially the viewpoint characters.","I'm one of those writers who say, 'I've enjoy having written.'","The success that the Tolkien books had redefined modern fantasy.","Nothing bores me more than books where you read two pages and you know exactly how it's going to come out. I want twists and turns that surprise me, characters that have a difficult time and that I don't know if they're going to live or die.","I spent a whole summer working on what proved to be 'A Game of Thrones'.","One of the great things about books is you can afford to do anything.","There was part of me that wanted to see the world and travel to distant places, but I could only do it in my imagination, so I read ferociously and imagined things.","I've written some standalone novels, but a book series allows fans in. There's much more intense involvement.","I watch NFL football on Sundays. I enjoy gaming with friends, meaning role-playing games; I still enjoy going to conventions and traveling.","The distinction between literary and genre fiction is stupid and pernicious. It dates back to a feud between Robert Louis Stevenson and Henry James. James won, and it split literature into two streams. But it's a totally false dichotomy.","Whether you're a history buff or a fantasy fan, Druon's epic will keep you turning pages. This was the original game of thrones. If you like 'A Song of Ice and Fire', you will love 'The Accursed Kings'.","The odd thing about being a writer is you do tend to lose yourself in your books. Sometimes it seems like real life is flickering by and you're hardly a part of it. You remember the events in your books better than you remember the events that actually took place when you were writing them.","Of course it's not enough to be a good man to be an effective ruler and it never has been.","I have idea files of books that I want to write one of these days, stories I want to write one of these days, but I'll probably never get to them.","I can see a scene in my head, and when I try to get it down in words on paper, the words are clunky; the scene is not coming across right. So frustrating. And there are days where it keeps flowing. Open the floodgates, and there it is. Pages and pages coming. Where the hell does this all come from? I don't know.","There is magic in my universe, but it's pretty low magic compared to other fantasies.","I have an instinctual distrust of conventional happy endings.","I find religion and spirituality fascinating. I would like to believe this isn't the end and there's something more, but I can't convince the rational part of me that that makes any sense whatsoever.","I suppose I'm a lapsed Catholic. You would consider me an atheist or agnostic.","As much as I love historical fiction, my problem with historical fiction is that you always know what's going to happen.","My characters who come back from death are worse for wear. In some ways, they're not even the same characters anymore. The body may be moving, but some aspect of the spirit is changed or transformed, and they've lost something.","If you go all the way back, I've always written science-fiction, I've always written fantasy, I've always written horror stories and monster stories, right from the beginning of my career. I've always moved back and forth between the genres. I don't really recognise that there's a significant difference between them in some senses.","If you're going to write about war, which my books are about, wars are nasty things. I think it's sort of a cheap, easy way out to write a war story in which no one ultimately dies.","The vast majority of writers out there, they finish their books, and no one cares whether their book is late or ever comes out at all. And then it comes out, and two reviews are published, and it sells 12 copies.","A lot of writing takes place in the subconscious, and it's bound to have an effect.","I have some other novels I want to write. I have a lot of short stories - I love the short story.","Many writers will get a contract by selling chapters and outlines or something like that. I wrote the entire novel, and when it was all finished, I would give it to my agent and say, 'Well, here's a novel; sell it if you can.' And they would do that, and it was good because I never had anyone looking over my shoulder.","Whenever I switch from one character to another, there's always a few days where I really struggle because I'm changing voices and I'm changing ways of looking at the world. I'm not just flicking a switch; it's harder process than that.","I had a couple of friends, but I was mostly the kid with his nose in a book.","When the writing is going really well, whole days and weeks go by, and I suddenly realise I have all these unpaid bills and, my God, I haven't unpacked, and the suitcase has been sitting there for three weeks.","Unfortunately in television, for whatever reason, fantasy became thought of as a kids' genre.","The cable makers are the ones who are willing to take risks and do something original and push the envelope some.","'Dreamsongs' allows me to show the scope of my writing - with personal commentary that puts the works in context and includes some autobiographical details intended to reveal how each piece came to be, what it represents, and how it has formed, or been informed by, my philosophy of writing.","All fiction has to have a certain amount of truth in it to be powerful.","I work for two years on a book and it comes out and two days later I've got my first e-mail: When is the next one coming out?","I don't know if I have any particular views about women in positions of power, though I do think it's more difficult for women, particularly in a Medieval setting. They have the additional problem that they're a woman and people don't want them in a position of power in an essentially patriarchal society.","An awful lot of fantasy, and even some great fantasy, falls into the mistake of assuming that a good man will be a good king, that all that is necessary is to be a decent human being and when you're king everything will go swimmingly.","There are some examples of medieval kings who were terrible human beings but were nevertheless good kings.","It's like these ideas, these characters, kind of bubble up inside me, and one day they're not there, and the next day they are there. They're alive, and they're whispering in my head and all that stuff, and I want to write about those things.","There has to be a level of joy of what you're doing.","One of the big breakthroughs, I think for me, was reading Robert A. Heinlein's four rules of writing, one of which was, 'You must finish what you write.' I never had any problem with the first one, 'You must write' - I was writing since I was a kid. But I never finished what writing.","Boy, there are days where I get up and say 'Where the hell did my talent go? Look at this crap that I'm producing here. This is terrible. Look, I wrote this yesterday. I hate this, I hate this.'","Writing is hard. I mean, I sit there and work at it.","I've said in many interviews that I like my fiction to be unpredictable. I like there to be considerable suspense.","I know some writers can write on the road, but I'm not one of them.","You can have the power to destroy, but it doesn't give you the power to reform, or improve, or build.","I was a novelist first. But in the mid-'80s, I did work in television for ten years. And yes, that was frequently the reaction to my scripts. People would say, 'You know, George, this is great. We love it, a terrific script, but it would cost five times our budget to shoot this.'","I have done a lot of work in Hollywood myself. I worked in television for roughly 10 years, from the mid-'80s to mid-'90s. And I was on staff at a couple of shows. I did some feature films, including originals and adaptations.","I have always been a dark writer.","When I'm writing from a character's viewpoint, in essence I become that character; I share their thoughts, I see the world through their eyes and try to feel everything they feel.","In my 10 years that I spent out in TV and film, I had my shares of frustrations and annoyances and disappointments, but also I think it was, in the long run, it was very good for me in a whole bunch of ways.","I wrote six pilots, none of which ever got picked up. When you stop trying, it then it falls in your lap.","I write from this tight third-person viewpoint, where each chapter is seen through the eyes of one individual character. When I'm writing that character, I become that character and identify with that character.","I'm a huge fan of Tolkien. I read those books when I was in junior high school and high school, and they had a profound effect on me. I'd read other fantasy before, but none of them that I loved like Tolkien.","One of the things I love, and I'm a voracious reader as well as a writer, is books that surprise me, that are not predictable.","I have many books that I want to write; I'd like to think that I'll be around for another 20 years or so and write another dozen novels, probably some sort of imaginative literature... Never again another seven-volume saga.","I never liked Gandalf the White as much as Gandalf the Grey, and I never liked him coming back. I think it would have been an even stronger story if Tolkien had left him dead.","'Rome' was one of my favourite shows, and I wish HBO had given it three more seasons 'cause I would have loved to continue watching it.","Believe it or not, I worked four summers in college as a sports writer covering baseball for a parks and rec department in Bayonne, N.J.","I do get invitations all of the time to play actual fantasy football, by the way, but I get the feeling that I'd like it too much. I have enough demands on my time. My fans would kill me.","I think that, in all of my time, I got just one fan letter, from an NFL fullback named Darian Barnes. NFL players might not have enough time for my books.","I love fantasy. I grew up reading fantasy.","The prejudice is still there, but it's breaking down. You have writers like Michael Chabon and The Yiddish Policemen's Union. He's a writer who's determined to break down genre barriers. He's done amazing things.","I had an encyclopedia with a list of flags in the back, so I would look at all these flags of China and Liberia and England and Denmark and whatever, and I learned all the different flags, and I tried to imagine what it would be like to be voyaging on some of these ships.","You always try to do your own thing. One of the things I wanted to do was to write a book that combines some of the best traits of contemporary fantasy with some of the traits of the historical novel.","You want people to be eager for your book; the downside is when the people forget the series even exists.","Yes - 90% of fantasy is crap. And so is 90% of science fiction and 90% of mystery fiction and 90% of literary fiction.","I worked out of Hollywood for 10 years and I had my heart broken half a dozen times, so I know all the things that can go wrong.","I've never been a fast writer.","I tend to write one character at a time. But I don't write the entirety of one character at a time.","When I am writing best, I really am lost in my world. I lose track of the outside world. I have a difficult time balancing between my real world and the artificial world.","I wanted to write a big novel, something epic in scale.","If I was a soldier going to war, I'd be pretty scared the night before a battle. It's a scary thing. And I want my readers to feel that fear as they turn the page.","I grew up with four T.V. channels. If you missed a show, you missed it. You gotta wait a week for the next one. I'd mail-order books: take a quarter, get an envelope, send off for it and wait until it arrived. I grew up waiting for things.","Over the years, more than one reviewer has described my fantasy series, 'A Song of Ice and Fire', as historical fiction about history that never happened, flavoured with a dash of sorcery and spiced with dragons. I take that as a compliment."],"George R. Roberts":["Across our country, social enterprise partnerships between the public and private sectors are providing millions of Americans - young and old - a second chance.","Social-enterprise employees earn wages and pay taxes, reducing their recidivism rates and dependence on government assistance.

Rather we should thank God that such men lived.","Courage is fear holding on a minute longer.","Accept the challenges so that you can feel the exhilaration of victory.","A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan executed next week.","The object of war is not to die for your country but to make the other bastard die for his.","If everyone is thinking alike, then somebody isn't thinking.","Battle is the most magnificent competition in which a human being can indulge. It brings out all that is best; it removes all that is base. All men are afraid in battle. The coward is the one who lets his fear overcome his sense of duty. Duty is the essence of manhood.","Better to fight for something than live for nothing.","The time to take counsel of your fears is before you make an important battle decision. That's the time to listen to every fear you can imagine!

It is the spirit of men who follow and of the man who leads that gains the victory.","Success is how high you bounce when you hit bottom.","We herd sheep, we drive cattle, we lead people.

I accepted everything, I believed everything, without struggle, without suffering, without regret, without false shame.

Now, with age and confidence, I can say, yeah, that's true, but I am cognisant of the fact that people can do things well. And can be more loving than you expect.","Early on, a story's meaning and rationale seem pretty obvious, but then, as I write it, I realize that I know the meaning/rationale too well, which means that the reader will also know it - and so things have to be ramped up.","It would be so weird if we knew just as much as we needed to know to answer all the questions of the universe. Wouldn't that be freaky? Whereas the probability is high that there is a vast reality that we have no way to perceive, that's actually bearing down on us now and influencing everything.","The artist's job, I think, is to be a conduit for mystery. To intuit it, and recognize that the story-germ has some inherent mystery in it, and sort of midwife that mystery into the story in such a way that it isn't damaged in the process, and may even get heightened or refined.","Nostalgia is, 'Hey, remember the other mall that used to be there?'","We try, we fail, we posture, we aspire, we pontificate - and then we age, shrink, die, and vanish.","Reading is a form of prayer, a guided meditation that briefly makes us believe we're someone else, disrupting the delusion that we're permanent and at the center of the universe. Suddenly (we're saved!) other people are real again, and we're fond of them.","There's a really nice moment in the life of a piece of writing where the writer starts to get a feeling of it outgrowing him - or he starts to see it having a life of its own that doesn't have anything to do with his ego or his desire to 'be a good writer.'","I think fiction isn't so good at being for or against things in general - the rhetorical argument a short story can make is only actualized by the accretion of particular details, and the specificity of these details renders whatever conclusions the story reaches invalid for wider application.","More and more these days what I find myself doing in my stories is making a representation of goodness and a representation of evil and then having those two run at each other full-speed, like a couple of PeeWee football players, to see what happens. Who stays standing? Whose helmet goes flying off?","Developing our sympathetic compassion is not only possible but the only reason for us to be here on earth.","I wasted a lot of years working on my writing and very grandly saying, 'And now... My Novel!,' which would soon be reduced to a short story, then to a paragraph.","I still believe that capitalism is too harsh and I believe that, even within that, there is a lot of satisfaction and beauty if you happen to be one of the lucky ones, although that doesn't eradicate the reality of the suffering. It's all true at once, kind of humming and sublime.","So I may not have had a gothic childhood, but childhood makes its own gothicity.","Fiction is a kind of compassion-generating machine that saves us from sloth. Is life kind or cruel? Yes, Literature answers. Are people good or bad? You bet, says Literature. But unlike other systems of knowing, Literature declines to eradicate one truth in favor of another.","Character is that sum total of moments we can't explain.","There might be a different model for a literary community that's quicker, more real-time, and involves more spontaneity.","It seems to me a worthy goal: try to create a representation of consciousness that's durable and truthful, i.e., that accounts, somewhat, for all the strange, tiny, hard-to-articulate, instantaneous, unwilled things that actually go on in our minds in the course of a given day, or even a given moment.","To me, the writer's main job is to just make the story unscroll in such a way that the reader is snared - she's right there, seeing things happen and caring about them. And if you dedicate yourself to this job, the meanings more or less take care of themselves. That's the theory, anyway.","It's funny with fiction - once you cut something, it hasn't happened anymore.","Back in 1992, I had my first story accepted by 'The New Yorker.'","A John Updike is a once-in-a-generation phenomenon, if that generation is lucky: so comfortable in so many genres, the same lively, generous intelligence suffusing all he did.","I tend to foster drama via bleakness. If I want the reader to feel sympathy for a character, I cleave the character in half, on his birthday. And then it starts raining. And he's made of sugar.","We have that illusion that we are 'deciding' what to make a character do, in order to 'convey our message' or something like that. But, at least in my experience, you are often more like a river-rafting guide who's been paid a bonus to purposely steer your clients into the roughest possible water.","I'm finding, as I get older, that I'm not much of a believer in redemption. I mean, I believe in redemption in real life - redemption does happen, and it's cool when it does - but I find myself getting leery of my desire for it in stories (especially my own).","I was a big and un-ironic fan of Dear Abby when I was a kid in Chicago. I think I sort of internalized her. So I have this inner Abby: cranky, proper, folksy yet scathing, with a beehive hairdo. But that's my issue.","The universal human laws - need, love for the beloved, fear, hunger, periodic exaltation, the kindness that rises up naturally in the absence of hunger/fear/pain - are constant, predictable, reliable, universal, and are merely ornamented with the details of local culture.","What a powerful thing to know: That one's own desires are mappable onto strangers; that what one finds in oneself will most certainly be found in The Other.","Chekhov - shall I be blunt? - is the greatest short story writer who ever lived.","Sometimes I think fiction exists to model the way God might think of us, if God had the time and inclination to do so.","The mind is a machine that is constantly asking: What would I prefer? Close your eyes, refuse to move, and watch what your mind does. What it does is become discontent with that-which-is. A desire arises, you satisfy that desire, and another arises in its place.","The word 'funny' is a bit like the word 'love' - we don't have enough words to describe the many varieties.","When I write I know that I'm going to have to produce 40 percent more than I need.","I'm always aware of writing around things I can't do, and I've come to think that that's actually what 'style' is - an avoidance of your deficiencies.","When you read a short story, you come out a little more aware and a little more in love with the world around you. What I want is to have the reader come out just 6 percent more awake to the world.","When I was a kid, I took 'The Brady Bunch' and 'The Partridge Family' very seriously. It was a world to me in the same way that the Greek myths would have been had I read them. You know, Marcia is Athena and Mr. Brady is Zeus.","The best thing that ever happened to me is that nothing happened in writing. I ended up working for engineering companies, and that's where I found my material, in the everyday struggle between capitalism and grace. Being broke and tired, you don't come home your best self.","That for me was the big turning point in my artistic life, when my wife and I had our kids. The world got infused with morality again. Every person in the world should theoretically be loved as much as I love my daughters.","If death is in the room, it's pretty interesting. But I would also say that I'm interested in getting myself to believe that it's going to happen to me. I'm interested in it, because if you're not, you're nuts. It's really de facto what we're here to find out about.","The chances of a person breaking through their own habits and sloth and limited mind to actually write something that gets out there and matters to people are slim.","I was trained in seismic prospecting. We'd drill a deep hole and put dynamite in the bottom and blow it up remotely, which would give you a cross-sectional picture of the subsurface, which tells you where to drill.","I often think about image, and image is something that - but in truth, the real artistic process, as I've understood it, is 95 percent intuitive, like seat-of-the-pants, at-the-moment decisions that you can't even explain, you know?","You don't want to be that parent - the one who dresses his kid in a cloth sack when all the other kids are in Armani cloth sacks - especially in a time like ours, when materialism is not only rampant and ascendant but is fast becoming the only game in town.","When something really bad is going on in a culture, the average guy doesn't see it. He can't. He's average and is surrounded by and immersed in the cant and discourse of the status quo.","If you think of a work of fiction as a kind of scale model of the world, then the positive valences - where things turn out better than you thought they would - ought to be in there somewhere, too.","Stories, as much as we like to talk about them, retrospectively, as emanations of theme or worldview or intention, occur primarily as technical objects when they're being written. Or at least they do for me. They're the result of thousands of decisions made at speed during revision.","I've had the thought that a person's 'artistic vision' is really just the cumulative combination of whatever particular stances he has sincerely occupied during his creative life - even if some of those might appear contradictory.","I could actually care less about the poor. We have some living near us, and pee-yew. They are always coming and going to their three or four jobs at all hours of the day and night. Annoying!","That seems to be the definition of 'novel' for me: a story that hasn't yet discovered a way to be brief.","I turned 54 this year and I find myself feeling like I'm in a bit of a race to get down on paper the way I really feel about life - or the way it has presented to me. And because it has presented to me very beautifully, this is hard. It is technically very hard to show positive manifestations.","And I have finally realized that, you know, it's not a given that my lifespan will accommodate my writing aspirations. It could be that it would take me 12 more books at six years each to get it - which means I would have to live to be 126. Which I fully intend to do, of course.","So for me the approach has become to go into a story not really sure of what I want to say, try to find some little seed crystal of interest, a sentence or an image or an idea, and as much as possible divest myself of any deep ideas about it. And then by this process of revision, mysteriously it starts to accrete meanings as you go.","I started out in engineering. I was a geophysical engineer. Throughout the course of my life I've done a lot of strange jobs, and the effect has been to make me think a little more skeptically about our capitalist society.","Whatever your supposed politics are - left, right - if you put it in a human connection, most people will rise to the occasion and feel the human pain in a way that they might not if it was presented in a more conceptual way.","I think in our time, you know, so much of the information we get is pre-polarized. Fiction has a way of reminding us that we actually are very similar in our emotions and our neurology and our desires and our fears, so I think it's a nice way to neutralize that polarization.","You know, you can talk about race, you can talk about sex, you can talk about your biopsy. But when you get into class, people kind of clench up.","For me, the game would be to assume a very intelligent reader who can extrapolate a lot from a little. And that's become my definition of art; to get that pitch just right, where I can put a hint on page three, and the reader's ears go up a bit, as opposed to dropping it all on the first page.","If you haven't read you don't have the voice. The lack of voice eliminates experience.","When I'm explaining something to you, if I'm being long-winded, and twisty in a non-productive way, I could make you feel vaguely insulted. And you'd have a right to be.","I was a straight arrow, a control freak. I didn't do drugs or drink, and this was the '70s. I didn't like the loss of control.

From the age of 12 until 16, I was in a boarding school-which, I believe, at that time was compulsory for blind children.","All my musical foundations go back to the age of 3.

However, those were simply speculations, and now we have evidence for the first part of these ideas.","I think we all want to know where we came from and how we fit into the world, but some of us need to know how it all works in great detail.","When I came to Berkeley, I met all these Nobel laureates and I got to know that they were regular people.

They have a solid basis in reality, but reality as distorted by a misconception.","The financial markets generally are unpredictable. So that one has to have different scenarios... The idea that you can actually predict what's going to happen contradicts my way of looking at the market.","Well, you know, I was a human being before I became a businessman.","The worse a situation becomes the less it takes to turn it around, the bigger the upside.","I see tremendous imbalance in the world. A very uneven playing field, which has gotten tilted very badly. I consider it unstable. At the same time, I don't exactly see what is going to reverse it.","Once we realize that imperfect understanding is the human condition there is no shame in being wrong, only in failing to correct our mistakes.","The people currently in charge have forgotten the first principle of an open society, namely that we may be wrong and that there has to be free discussion. That it's possible to be opposed to the policies without being unpatriotic.","I give away something up to $500 million a year throughout the world promoting Open Society. My foundations support people in the country who care about an open society. It's their work that I'm supporting. So it's not me doing it.","The reality is that financial markets are self-destabilizing; occasionally they tend toward disequilibrium, not equilibrium.","I'm not doing my philanthropic work, out of any kind of guilt, or any need to create good public relations. I'm doing it because I can afford to do it, and I believe in it.","Markets are constantly in a state of uncertainty and flux and money is made by discounting the obvious and betting on the unexpected.","I chose America as my home because I value freedom and democracy, civil liberties and an open society.","Just as the process of repealing national alcohol prohibition began with individual states repealing their own prohibition laws, so individual states must now take the initiative with respect to repealing marijuana prohibition laws.","I put forward a pretty general theory that financial markets are intrinsically unstable. That we really have a false picture when we think about markets tending towards equilibrium.","Bush's war in Iraq has done untold damage to the United States. It has impaired our military power and undermined the morale of our armed forces. Our troops were trained to project overwhelming power. They were not trained for occupation duties.","The criminalization of marijuana did not prevent marijuana from becoming the most widely used illegal substance in the United States and many other countries. But it did result in extensive costs and negative consequences.","Now that I have called you on your false accusation, you are using additional smear tactics.","We must recognize that as the dominant power in the world we have a special responsibility. In addition to protecting our national interests, we must take the leadership in protecting the common interests of humanity.","Who most benefits from keeping marijuana illegal? The greatest beneficiaries are the major criminal organizations in Mexico and elsewhere that earn billions of dollars annually from this illicit trade - and who would rapidly lose their competitive advantage if marijuana were a legal commodity.","My foundations support people in the country who care about an open society. It's their work that I'm supporting. So it's not me doing it. But I can empower them. I can support them, and I can help them.","I think there's a lot of merit in an international economy and global markets, but they're not sufficient because markets don't look after social needs.","When it comes to social consequences, they've got all different people acting in different ways, very difficult to even have a proper criterion of success. So, it's a difficult task.","I would prefer not to be involved in party politics.","To my mind, there is a solution which has to do with democracy, because democratic governments are subject to the will of the people. So, if the people will it, you can actually create international institutions through the democratic states.","A lot of the evil in the world is actually not intentional. A lot of people in the financial system did a lot of damage without intending to.","Increasingly, the Chinese will own a lot more of the world because they will be converting their dollar reserves and U.S. government bonds into real assets.","An open society is a society which allows its members the greatest possible degree of freedom in pursuing their interests compatible with the interests of others.","Regulating and taxing marijuana would simultaneously save taxpayers billions of dollars in enforcement and incarceration costs, while providing many billions of dollars in revenue annually.","There is a resurgence of anti-Semitism in Europe.

It's really a great invention and I wouldn't under-estimate the value of that, but they're not designed to take care of social needs.","If the terrorists have the sympathy of people, it's much harder to find them. So we need people on our side, and that leads us to be responsible leaders of the world, show some concern with the problems.","A full and fair discussion is essential to democracy.","We are the most powerful nation on earth. No external power, no terrorist organization, can defeat us. But we can defeat ourselves by getting caught in a quagmire.","President Bush is endangering our safety, hurting our vital interests, and undermining American values.","Proposition 19 already is a winner no matter what happens on election day. The mere fact of its being on the ballot has elevated and legitimized public discourse about marijuana and marijuana policy in ways I could not have imagined a year ago.","Market fundamentalists recognize that the role of the state in the economy is always disruptive, inefficient, and generally has negative connotations. This leads them to believe that the market mechanism can take care of all the problems.","Law has become a business. Health care has become a business.

I had a vague idea of the story.","The benefit of this kind of outlining is that you discover a story's flaws before you invest a lot of time writing the first draft, and it's almost impossible to get stuck at a difficult chapter, because you've already done the work to push through those kinds of blocks.","I've been reading horror since I was five years old.","When I was a teenager, I got into SF, quite heavily, and that too has had a major impact on my writing.","Even the contemporary horror authors who have seriously influenced me are a disparate bunch.","I'm a fan of short horror fiction... in fact, the most memorable horror I've read is of the short variety... but I have a hard time pulling it off myself.","I've devoted a lot of my time and effort during the past few years to developing my advertising copywriting business to the point of where I can support my family and don't have to depend on writing fiction for my income."],"George Stephenson":["The rage for railroads is so great that many will be laid in parts where they will not pay.","I am much obliged by the favourable sentiments you express towards me, and shall be happy if I can be of service in carrying into execution your plans.","I am glad to learn that the Parliament Bill has been passed for the Darlington Railway.","The principles upon which a safety lamp might be constructed I stated to several persons long before Sir Humphrey Davy came into this part of the country."],"George Stevens, Jr.":["When you feel an audience engaged and surprised and enthusiastic, reacting to what you've planned, that is the reward.

I was pretty much on course and - as I sometimes joke - was prepared to devote my life to become the second best film director in my family.","What people see the first family do has an effect.

That's a fierce thing, to discover within yourself that which you despise the most in others.","Only the picture matters. It's what goes on the screen that counts.","I was on a picture for four or five days, had an opportunity to be on a set, and the assistant cameraman kept showing me things. One day I climbed the fence, knowing they needed an assistant cameraman. A couple of days later, I was one. The first day or two, it was pretty disastrous, but I knew something about photography, and I caught on quick.","I had done some work when I was starting in with photography on westerns, and photographing them was the greatest pleasure I had. If I was ever qualified for anything, it would have had to do with making westerns. But as I started working on pictures with people like Katharine Hepburn, I got further away from the thing I really liked to do.","For me it's absolutely necessary to start from the very beginning. I can't think of coming and contributing something anywhere along the line other than the very start.","It's like trying to be a traffic cop and write a poem at the same time. You need an executive head to handle all the vast paraphernalia of moviemaking. You need another, more sensitive head to get the delicate human emotional values you are trying to put on film.","In most Westerns, you know, people are shooting off guns all the time until you don't even notice it anymore.","The camera is not the instrument. People are always the instrument.","I was fascinated by all of it. The sounds of the theater and the audience, their rapture when a play took over and moved them and held them quietly... When the audience was truly moved, it was absolutely quiet. They were in a communion because they were learning the truth about themselves.","Nothing is more pleasant for me than to be on location in the country that I love, in any of our western landscapes, being out there with a camp outfit and a film company.","The audience too should be respected by being presented with a film as they remember it, and for those who have not seen it, as it was intended to be seen. Anything less is a degradation of the film and its audience.","I thought I might say something to newsmen that could be turned into a scandal.","I'm interested in all the new ideas, such as 3-D and widescreen, but I don't believe the technical method of presentation is the real important thing.","I personally like to see films that are the work of as singular a consciousness as possible.","Three takes. You're either going to get it, or you're not going to get it. There's no use persisting; it just had to work that way."],"George Stigler":["That subject has lost its one time appeal to economists as our science has become more abstract, but my interest has even grown more intense as the questions raised by the sociology of science became more prominent.","Two years later, I went to the University of Minnesota from which I was on leave for several years during the war as a member of Statistical Research Group at Columbia University.","The delicate and intricate pattern of competition and cooperation in the economic behavior of the hundreds of thousands of citizens of Stockholm offers a challenge to the economist that is perhaps as complex as the challenges of the physicist and the chemist.","The Chicago Economics Department was in intellectual ferment, although the central issues of the 1930's were very different from those in later times. I had never before encountered minds of that quality at close quarters and they influenced me strongly.","My teaching began in 1936 at Iowa State College where T. W. Schultz was the department chairman.","My main graduate training was received at the University of Chicago from which I received the Ph.D. in 1938.","My interests were aroused, and my faith in the cliches of the subject destroyed, as so often with other subjects, by the discussions with my friend, Aaron Director.","It was in the 1960s that I began the detailed study of public regulation.","In the 1950s, I proposed the survivor method of determining the efficient sizes of enterprises, and worked on delivered price systems, vertical integration, and similar topics.","In 1958, I came to Chicago where I have remained.","I started working and publishing in price theory by 1938.","I met my wife, Margaret L. Mack, at the University of Chicago. We were married in 1936. She died in 1970.","I attended schools in Seattle through the University of Washington, from which I was graduated in 1931. I spent the next year at Northwestern University.","Even before I came to Chicago, I had gotten interested in the existence of dispersion of prices under conditions which economic theory said would yield a single price.","And yet I would not freely exchange my science for those of my fellow laureates. They are forever confined in their professional discussions to the small numbers of their fellow scientists.","After the war, I returned to Minnesota, from which I soon moved to Brown University, and a year later, to Columbia University where I remained from 1947 until 1958.","A Swedish physicist can not discuss his work with fifty people unless he goes abroad. A Swedish economist can get opinions and instructions in his native language from thousands upon thousands of his fellow citizens."],"George Stoneman":["A military life has ever comported with my inclination.","I have therefore concluded to apply for the privilege of becoming a Cadet at West Point.","I will embrace the first opportunity to get to California and it is altogether probable that when once there I shall never again leave it."],"George Strait":["I like people who are loyal to me, and I like to be loyal, too.","I think the melody is the first time I hear in a song and if I like the melody, then I'll pay closer attention to the lyrics.","You know, traditional country music is something that's going to be around forever.","You know, traditional country music is something that's going to be around forever... I'm not worried about it.","I'm going to write, and after two years, when I've quit touring, if a special event comes up that I want to do, by all means I will do it, but as far as a structured tour goes, at the last date of 2014 goes, that will be it for touring.","You know, legends are people like Haggard and Jones and Wills and Sinatra. Those people are legends. I'm just a young buck out here trying to keep in that same circle with the rest of 'em.","Swing is my favorite kind of music.","If it's a good song and it fits me, that's what I'm going to do, I'm not out there trying to change the world. I'm just out there trying to sing country music the best way I can.","I've been blessed with the ability to sing, and that has taken me so many places I never would have gone otherwise.","I want to reach the point where people hear my name and immediately think of real country music.","I love the song 'El Rey.' And for years, I never knew what the song was totally about. It was something new for me. I'd never sung a song in Spanish before. Then I got the translation and saw what a really cool song it was.","Even though I've been doing it for so long, I still feel fresh. Even when I walk out on stage, I still feel pretty much the same as I've always felt.","I'm a country singer. I love all kinds of music, but country is where my loyalty lies. That's just me and what I do, and I'm not going to change it.","I always enjoy it when I walk on stage. There were some times when I was working so much in the '80s, and I felt really burnt-out. But I'd be up there singing and not be 10,000 million miles away, you know, just opening my mouth and the words coming out.","I loved making Pure Country. It was a great learning experience for me, seeing another part of the entertainment industry.","You don't have to be a cheater to sing a cheatin' song, that's what I'm saying.","I love to fish. You can go hours without anything happening, and all of a sudden a big blue marlin comes into the spread and it's cockpit chaos. My dream is to catch a grander, a 1,000 pounder.","I love to fish offshore for billfish, and have fished all over for them from the Bahamas, St. Thomas, Venezuela, Panama, Costa Rica, Mexico to the Texas gulf. I haven't made it to Australia yet, but someday I'm going.","I discovered in college that country music could be fun adding some swing to it.","This is the kind of problem you want to have! Country radio has been great to me my whole career. I can't thank those folks enough.","Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys are simply the best band that ever was.","Country music is important to me, and I love it, but it's not my whole life.","I can only say thank you and thanks also to all of the great songwriters who wrote those wonderful songs that became number ones.","I didn't want to be 40 or 50 years old and still playing clubs, I didn't feel like I was making any progress, and I actually gave the band notice at one point. I began to have doubts about my abilities.","I don't think my music's as traditional as people make it out.","I get asked sometimes 'What's the highlight of my career?' because I've been doing it for so long, and I always have a hard time coming up with something, because so many good things have happened.","I just continue to look for different material, great material, as good as I can find, and try to go in there and do as good a job as I can do in making it a record. That's all you can expect. That's all that you can do.","I listen to Mark Chestnutt and think he's a great singer - and he really does good material.","I think 'Beyond the Blue Neon' is the best I've ever done.","I think that all my albums are different enough where I don't feel like I did this the last time.","I've always liked Frank Sinata and Big Band music.","If twang isn't what I do, I don't know what is.","If you start out trying to achieve a specific thing - like doing stadium shows or going into the studio and doing an album - the end result is what counts.","In the beginning, I wanted to be successful. I wanted to make and have hit records.","My son had toyed with the idea of writing and trying to write a little bit, so that kind of gave me the bug to write also.","Of all the songs I've recorded, 'Amarillo By Morning' always sticks out in my mind.","Sinatra, in my opinion, is possibly the greatest male singer of all time.","We work hard when we're in the studio, but then when we take our breaks, we walk outside and look around.","When I think about putting together an album, the process of listening to hundreds of songs each time and picking out the best 10 or so that will go on the record, it really sinks in as to just how many songs I've listened to all these years.","You've got to keep the stage world and your real world separated or you're headed for trouble.","I've had great fans, and they've been so loyal over the years.","I don't mind traveling that much when I can go somewhere and stay there for a while, but touring is different. You rarely see anything. You get there early in the morning and you're resting all day, and you go in and do a sound check, and you do the show, and then bam you're gone.","I've been fortunate.","I've just tried for all of these years to find the best records, the best songs that I could find that fit me, and I've had great people to work with all these years.","I'm just not going to tour. One point I want to get across to everybody is that I'm still going to make records and I may still do some events. It's not the last time I'm onstage. It's been a part of my life for too long to quit everything. I have done it since the '80s, and I think it's time now to maybe see if I can live without that part.","I've always thought that whether I'm writing or not, I've gotta pick the best songs, whether or not they're mine. I'm not gonna sing them just because I wrote them. I've gotta find the best songs to make the best record I can.","I'd say three years ago we played in my hometown of San Antonio for 55,000 people at the Alamodome and walking out there with a crowd like that is just, you're excited, you're scared. There are just so many emotions going on. I still get nervous for things like that until after I sing about the first one or two songs, then I settle down.","In the beginning, I wanted to be successful. I wanted to make and have hit records. And I wanted everything that went along with it.","Country music is important to me, and I love it, but it's not my whole life... I like to be outdoors, I like to hunt, I like to fish, I like to play golf.","I used to do a lot of interviews in the early '80s, when my career started, but it came to a point when I decided I didn't want to talk anymore, and people kind of understood that and left me alone.","I'm always looking for great songs, and not being much of a songwriter, I depend on great songwriters to send them to me. I go through tons of stuff, and sometimes you just find material that kind of fits and becomes something special.","I remember that in '81, country radio was pretty pop, and everybody wanted a crossover record - and all of a sudden it came back to traditional. Now it's kind of swung the other way a little bit, but it always comes back.","I spend most of hunting season at the ranch. We all love to hunt whitetails, and we have a pretty good supply in South Texas. I also love to hunt elk in Arizona, mule deer in Utah, and I've been to Canada to hunt caribou."],"George Stroumboulopoulos":["I went to a Catholic School, and underneath my school uniform, I wore a metal shirt.","Sports is a bunch of people gathering around, watching something that they're not actually connected to - they're just emotionally connected.","You have to trust the people who work with you and hire, but also listen to as many smart people as you can.","I really think a good host is just a connector. I'm more traffic cop than star. My job is to get people on and off the program, and hopefully keep the audience entertained.","A lot of people don't realize that I started my career in sports and was a sports reporter long before I was on television. I used to be an NBA reporter and an NHL reporter.","Sports is entertainment.","Guns are part of the Constitution, and no one is willing to have that tough conversation with Congress and the Senate and the president to say maybe that's got to change. People talk about it - but I mean actual change.","Look at the way I look. Guys like me aren't on TV too often. Not on news channels.","A lot of people take shots at news channels.","I have sort of a life in Los Angeles.","If an interview just serves the idea of celebrity, then I think that sucks. I don't want to do that.","I don't have a real plan when I do an interview. I have some themes that I want to hit. But I don't have a set list of questions that I knock off.","I'm not ambitious, I never have been; it's just not in my DNA.","I only do what I love, when I love, how I love to fill up the time.","You watch Bono in a room - and we're talking about a room of thousands swarming around him - he'll take every single person and make that moment about them. You can pat him on the back or pull his arm, he's not looking away from the person he's talking to.","I am who I am: I have my life experiences and my professional experiences.","It's a dream for me to work with Ron MacLean and Don Cherry as well as my old friend Jeff Marek, who I started my career with.","I don't ever have the opportunity to wear a suit.","News channels have always had interview shows, but we need different kinds of interviews with different kinds of interviewers - interviewers who bring different life experiences to the table.","I'm looking for conversations that will be meaningful with people that want to have meaningful connections with an audience.","I don't do gossipy interviews because I don't think that helps; I think that's a distraction.","I'm pretty rough around the edges, but I'm a very open person.","I operate with an emotional fearlessness, and I really feel music; I really feel songs.","Sports and music are the same thing to me. When done wrong, they are really frustrating; when done right, they can change your day."],"George Sutherland":["For the saddest epitaph which can be carved in memory of a vanished freedom is that it was lost because its possessors failed to stretch forth a saving hand while there was still time.","If the provisions of the constitution be not upheld when they pinch as well as when they comfort, they may as well be abandoned.","The legal right of a taxpayer to decrease the amount of what otherwise would be his taxes, or altogether avoid them, by means which the law permits, cannot be doubted.","They say the average person can't make a living in art... but if you tell me there's something I can't do, that's what I have to do."],"George Szell":["Conductors must give unmistakable and suggestive signals to the orchestra - not choreography to the audience.","In music one must think with the heart and feel with the brain."],"George Takei":["I remembered some people who lived across the street from our home as we were being taken away. When I was a teenager, I had many after-dinner conversations with my father about our internment. He told me that after we were taken away, they came to our house and took everything. We were literally stripped clean.","We were American citizens. We were incarcerated by our American government in American internment camps here in the United States. The term 'Japanese internment camp' is both grammatically and factually incorrect.","I intend to live life, not just exist.","I spent my boyhood behind the barbed wire fences of American internment camps and that part of my life is something that I wanted to share with more people.","One of the gifts of 'Star Trek' is my professional work colleagues have become my lifelong friends.","'Star Trek' is about acceptance, and the strength of the Starship Enterprise is that it embraces diversity in all its forms.","Yes, I remember the barbed wire and the guard towers and the machine guns, but they became part of my normal landscape. What would be abnormal in normal times became my normality in camp.","I was four years old when Pearl Harbor was bombed on December 7, 1941 by Japan, and overnight, the world was plunged into a world war. America suddenly was swept up by hysteria.","It was an egregious violation of the American Constitution. We were innocent American citizens, and we were imprisoned simply because we happened to look like the people who bombed Pearl Harbor. It shows us just how fragile our Constitution is.","What is important is the reliability of my posts being there to greet my fans with a smile or a giggle every morning. That's how we keep on growing.","When Pearl Harbor was bombed, young Japanese-Americans, like all young Americans, rushed to their draft board to volunteer to fight for our country. That act of patriotism was answered with a slap in the face. We were denied service and categorized as enemy non-alien.","As my audience grew more diverse, I started interjecting social justice advocacy and commentaries about LGBT equality, and it just kept growing more.","When I was going to gay bars in my 20s and 30s, the older guys there explained to me that the police would occasionally raid these places and march the clients out, load them onto paddy wagons, drive them down to the station, photograph them, fingerprint them and put their names on a list. They were doing nothing wrong, and it was criminalized.","It has long been a dream of mine that this important story one day would be told on the great American stage of Broadway. In fact, I've dedicated much of the latter half of my life to ensuring the story of the internment is known.","On a bus, your eyes, ears, and pores are open absorbing in the variety, the wonder, and the magic of the city. It's a wonderful way to get to know the city.","My grandmother lived to 104 years old, and part of her success was she woke up every morning to a brand new day. She said every morning is a new gift. Her favorite hobby was collecting birthdays.","I do find things funny. When you see life through the eyes of someone with a good sense of humor, which my grandmother did, life is a human comedy.","My father told me about American democracy. And he said you have to be actively engaged in the political process to make our democracy work. So I've been doing that my entire life. Civil rights movement. The peace movement during the Vietnam conflict. The movement to get an apology and redress for Japanese-Americans.","Our democracy is dependent on people who passionately cherish the ideals of a democracy. Every man is created equal with an inalienable right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It's a wonderful idea, and it takes people who cherish that idea to be actively involved in the process.","I think being optimistic is ensuring your success. If you start out saying 'I've got this problem,' or 'I'm angry at that,' you will not succeed.","You know, I grew up in two American internment camps, and at that time I was very young.","It has a Nazi echo, doesn't it? The Jews had to wear that Star of David, and Donald Trump is saying all Syrians have to carry an ID card and they can, without warrant, go into any Syrian's home or a mosque.","It's difficult working with someone who is not a team player.","I've run the marathon several times, so I definitely don't look like the Great Ancestor!","And it seems to me important for a country, for a nation to certainly know about its glorious achievements but also to know where its ideals failed, in order to keep that from happening again.","I was blessed with my career. I passionately love acting. And it's given me a good livelihood.","When I was a very young actor, I cruised around in a pretty cool vehicle called the Starship Enterprise.","There's no point living at my age with many ingrained great fears.","I've known Lisa Lampanelli for quite some time. We did the Shatner roast together. Lisa didn't know Shatner, but she's a popular roaster, so she was invited to do it, and she is fantastic. Actually, despite her public image, she's a very sweet lady and very sensitive. She cries very easily. Most people don't know that.","We have to remember that Putin was a member of the KGB. He has already demonstrated that kind of macho, dictatorial attitude. Russia has breached their pledge to uphold the Olympic charter. This is a great opportunity for the IOC to say we cannot, given the situation that exists currently, allow the Olympics to take place in Russia.","They didn't incarcerate the Japanese-Americans in Hawaii. That's the place that was bombed. But the Japanese-American population was about 45 percent of the island of Hawaii. And if they extracted those Japanese-Americans, the economy would have collapsed. But on the mainland, we were thinly spread out up and down the West Coast.","To do theater you need to block off a hunk of time.","This is supposed to be a participatory democracy and if we're not in there participating then the people that will manipulate and exploit the system will step in there.","Every time we had a hot war going on in Asia, it was difficult for Asian Americans here.","The best way to get people to connect with an issue is to humanize it. You can do so much more powerfully with music and touch the heart.","ISIS itself regularly fuels hatred of gay people and violence towards them. It broadcasts gruesome executions of homosexuals thrown blindfolded from rooftops.","I discovered that funny animal pictures - memes - would get a lot of likes and shares.","When I came out, I was 68, and I was totally prepared for my career to recede when I spoke to the press for the first time. What happened after that blew me away. I started getting more offers. My career blossomed.","We are living in a science fiction world.","I think Donald Trump's interpretation of marriage is something that he himself doesn't really believe in. 'Traditional marriage' is where two people love each other, commit to each other, care for each other over the years. It is a meaningful ceremony, and his interpretation of that is not recognizing what real marriage is.","People want to start their day off with a smile or, better yet, a guffaw.","We need to get some rationality on the Second Amendment. This is crazy what we allow ourselves.","When billionaires can give $50 million, $500 million to a campaign, and there's no limit, then it makes a mockery of 'one man, one vote.'","In the United States, we have a large, broad middle that are decent, fair-minded people who are too busy to really think about issues other than their next paycheck. Those are the people that we want to get to in order to change the social climate. And Howard Stern has that audience. So I said, 'Let's boldly go where I've never been before.'","It'd be nice to be what they call a Renaissance man.","Children are amazingly adaptable. What would be grotesquely abnormal became my normality in the prisoner of war camps. It became routine for me to line up three times a day to eat lousy food in a noisy mess hall. It became normal for me to go with my father to bathe in a mass shower.","The arc of our history is toward more equality being expanded to more and more people.","Up until the time I was cast in 'Star Trek,' the roles were pretty shallow - thin, stereotyped, one-dimensional roles. I knew this character was a breakthrough role, certainly for me as an individual actor but also for the image of an Asian character: no accent, a member of the elite leadership team.","Those Tea Party people are crazy. I mean, they're lunatics. They close down the government, throw people out of their jobs - hundreds of thousands of people - and they say that they're doing it ultimately in the interest of creating jobs.","I'm an anglophile. I visit England regularly, sometimes three or four times a year, at least once a year.","My memories of camp - I was four years old to eight years old - they're fond memories.","But when we came out of camp, that's when I first realized that being in camp, that being Japanese-American, was something shameful.","I marched back then - I was in a civil-rights musical, Fly Blackbird, and we met Martin Luther King.","As you know, when Star Trek was canceled after the second season, it was the activism of the fans that revived it for a third season.","Well, the whole history of Star Trek is the market demand.","I'm a civic busybody and I've been blessed with an active career.","STAR TREK is a show that had a vision about a future that was positive.","Well, it gives, certainly to my father, who is the one that suffered the most in our family, and understanding of how the ideals of a country are only as good as the people who give it flesh and blood.","Plays close, movies wrap and TV series eventually get cancelled, and we were cancelled in three season.","I thought this convention phenomenon was very flattering, but that's about the extent of it.","Then that did very well at the box office, so before you knew it, we were in a string of feature motion pictures. Then they announced that they were going to do some spinoffs of us.","I love people. When you're engaged with society and trying to make it a better society, you're an optimist.","This political climate today reminds me of what my father must have gone through in 1942, when the winds of war and fires of hate were surrounding him. We have a candidate for the presidency of the United States, Donald Trump, using the same rhetoric that my father must have heard from elected officials.","It kills me to hear Donald Trump talking.","The central pillar of our justice system is due process. You have got to be charged with a crime. Then you can challenge those charges in a court of law with a trial.","When I heard Donald Trump make that sweeping hysterical statement that all Muslims have to be banned because they are terrorists, I was chilled by that.","I have a sister who is technophobic; she doesn't even use a computer.","When Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed the same-sex marriage bill, my blood was boiling. I had been silent, but that night, Brad and I watched the news and saw all these young people pouring out on Santa Monica Boulevard venting their rage, and I said, 'I have to speak out.'","I may not have trekked through the galaxies in reality. But I have trekked all over this planet: Australia, Asia, Latin America, Europe.","I do think that Japan will be one of the nations that have equality, and that, too, will serve as an example for other Asian nations.","I'm optimistic, and I have a lot of goals. And I obey the laws of nature: I eat, exercise, and rest properly. But mostly it's about keeping the mind engaged. My grandmother lived to 104, and she had all of her faculties. I'm physically active and devout - just not as Buddhistic as she was.","It will be written on my tombstone in very large letters, 'Here lies Hikaru Sulu,' and in very tiny letters, 'aka George Takei.' I don't protest the inevitable.","I'm an actor. I love acting and being able to use my love, my passion, to also contribute to making this a better society, a better democracy, and a better country.","Would-be terrorists cannot so much as board a plane without a thorough screening, yet we give them nearly unfettered access to very dangerous weapons.","Arguments that we will never stop all shootings by restricting access to such weapons fails to account for our strong and common desire at least to stop many of them - or any of them.","It's safe to assume none of us actually wants to see ISIS-inspired terrorists armed with semi-automatic rifles, able to attack at will within our own borders.","Following the Orlando attack, ISIS claimed the attacker as one of its own and called for even more such killings worldwide.","Happily, the days when overt racial discrimination and segregation were championed by social conservatives are long past."],"George Tenet":["You know, at the end of the day, the only thing you have is trust and honor in this world. That's all you have. All you have is your reputation built on trust and your personal honor. When you don't have that anymore, well, you know, there you go. Trust was broken.","I still lie awake at night thinking about everything that could have been, that wasn't done to stop 9/11. To the 9/11 families, I said, you deserve better from your entire government. All of us.","Iraq... has also had contacts with al-Qaida. Their ties may be limited by divergent ideologies, but the two sides' mutual antipathy toward the United States and the Saudi royal family suggests that tactical cooperation between them is possible.","To understand a difficult topic like Iraq takes patience and care. Unfortunately, you rarely hear a patient, careful or thoughtful discussion of intelligence these days.","The President had every reason to believe that the text presented to him was sound... These 16 words should never have been included in the text written for the president.","The only people that ever stand up and tell the truth are who? Intelligence officers. Because our culture is, never break faith with the truth. We'll tell you, you don't have to drag it out of us.","We could never verify that there was any Iraqi authority, direction and control, complicity with al Qaeda for 9/11 or any operational act against America. Period.","I'm Greek, and we're conspiratorial by nature.","Here's the teaching point, if you're teaching kids about intelligence and policy: Intelligence does not absolve policymakers of responsibility to ask tough questions, and it doesn't absolve them of having curiosity about the consequences of their actions.","I am convinced the next major attack against the United States may well be conducted by people with Asian or African faces, not the ones that many Americans are alert to.","As a nation we have, over the past seven years, been rebuilding our intelligence with powerful capabilities that many thought we would no longer need after the Cold War. We have been rebuilding our clandestine service, our satellite and other technical collection, our analytical depth and expertise.","By definition, intelligence deals with the unclear, the unknown, the deliberately hidden. What the enemies of the United States hope to deny we work to reveal.","When I came to the CIA in the mid-'90s, our graduating class of case officers was unbelievably low. Now, after years of rebuilding, our training programs and putting our best efforts to recruit the most talented men and women, we are graduating more clandestine officers than at any time in the history of the Central Intelligence Agency."],"George Thorogood":["Whatever title you want to lay on me is fine. I am still working; you know what I'm saying?","There is no doubt in my mind who is number one - I have always been number one.","Look at Gleason in The Honeymooners. He was humorous but the way he lived wasn't really humorous. He was a bus driver. Who wants to be a bus driver? He didn't have any money and he was not famous. But despite that, the show is humorous.","I was not a big Allman Brothers fan but I could relate to that because that is what the flavor of the day was at that time - at least it was like that for me.","All I have is my performance, I try to feed in the best of everything that I could possibly do into those 90 minutes and to make a live entertainment show out of it.","Classic Rock radio gave us our longevity.","Did I think it would last 30 years? No, I didn't think it would have those kind of legs.","Every time the guys were knocked out by my guitar playing and the girls were knocked out by the type of songs I did. That set us apart from the average blues band.","I didn't live in the world of disco or the world of the Eagles.","I figured the people who liked the sort of thing I was doing would come see it. If it was only 200 then that was alright and if it was 2000 then that is alright as well. I wasn't really interested in the big numbers; I was just interested in some numbers.","I guess a good song is a good song is a good song, ya know.","I knew I had the right material and I knew what I was going after.","I know I'm not going to sing like Aretha Franklin or Elvis Presley or any of those people.","I wanted to write songs that were as good as the covers.","I was a big J.

I'm talking young here, not a college drinking crowd.","Not to this extent but from day one I had an awful lot of confidence when I got started.","The reason it has lasted for 30 years is for one reason and one reason only: Classic Rock radio.","There are now grandmothers and grandfathers coming to see us because they are of that age, they grew up in the '50s and '60s and they bring their sons and their daughters to hear the songs they heard when they were young.","This music has been around since before the beard on Moses. I happed to do it very well and I happen to have a lot of groovy songs that I know people are going to dig. I know more about it than you do.","We've plotted through the years of how to get to here, where we are now, or we would have never made it.","When people come to the show they think we are a legendary band because they hear us on Classic Rock radio all the time. It is psychological. That's okay - I'm down with that.","You can't rely on luck. I've had some stages in my career where I've said we're going to wing it, and we've always ended up in trouble.","Rounder Records decided to call the album Move It On Over, much to my chagrin but they knew what they were doing. It took off and to this day I can't figure out why."],"George Tillman, Jr.":["I shoot a lot of film - that's one of the things I try to do, and it's one of the things I learned how to do with Robert De Niro on 'Men of Honor.'","I love telling stories from a kid's point of view because they don't really see all the obstacles in front of them. They're resilient, and sometimes adults can steal that from them.","It's called 'Miles Davis, Prince of Darkness,' and it's about Miles Davis, the genius, and why he was the way he was, and how he changed music so many times. He changed music six times. So, I'm excited about that movie.","I want to see that 'Anita' documentary. I want to see 'Lovelace'; I want to see 'After Midnight,' because I saw the other two and I loved them. I thought the last one was great.","Filmmakers are always in a bubble; along with our crew or writer, we don't really get to socialize with other filmmakers, so the great thing about Sundance is you can see many other filmmakers doing the same thing you do.","These guys at Fox knew that as a filmmaker, I could always tell different types of stories and each can emotionally connect to a universal audience.","I never paid attention to many of the Nicholas Sparks films. 'The Notebook,' which my wife liked, I felt that Ryan Gosling was a genius in it and Rachel McAdams has this thing about her that you just want to take care of her. I remember that chemistry between them.","You can't make an action movie without action, and so, you can't make a romance movie without romance.","Sometimes I get into the movies and into the roles; it's hard for me to move on.","Even looking at my last film, 'Notorious,' you got a perception about B.I.G. and who he was, but there was a different side to him.","Steve McQueen was the guy who said less, and everything was all behind his words and what he didn't say, and you still felt emotionally connected and rooted behind him.","I don't really consider myself a writer.","As the director, I try to go in and know as much as I can about the material. I really try to go in and understand what all the characters are about, what the movie's going to look like.","When I was working on 'Men of Honor' with Robert De Niro, there's a pipe that he has in the movie, and it took us about six weeks to find the right pipe for him to use and feel comfortable with. It was a great choice, because it was really about what worked with the camera at that time.","I think it's important that a director be able to know his characters inside and out.","It's my responsibility to make the movie work with the schedule and money we have. It's my job to get the best movie we can do in the time we have.","Several hundred years ago, the only thing that slave families had was cooking and their family meals.","There was a group of six women in my household. My mom, aunts and grandma. I watched them in the kitchen.","I call it soul food, and I call it compassion food because it kind of bonds loved ones together. It kept families together for a long time.","Food was a labor of love you felt by cooking it and eating it.","I didn't understand the Los Angeles atmosphere.","I used to get so upset with my father. I'd ask him, 'Why do I have to be around all these women all the time?' But in time, I learned that was an advantage.","I'm in this business to make films, not get deluded by the system. The system is set up to give you a headache.","I wanted to make a movie about a black family in Middle America. I wanted to make a film where everyone can look at them and say, 'This is my family.'","I realized that food was actually a metaphor for bringing us all together. It's about us communicating and being like family."],"George V. Higgins":["Data is what distinguishes the dilettante from the artist.","Egotism: The art of seeing in yourself what others cannot see."],"George Vancouver":["Not considering this opening worthy of more attention, I continued our pursuit to the Northwest, being desirous to embrace the advantages of the prevailing breeze.","A British declaration be taken against Martinez for 'capturing and robbing us.","The sea has now changed from it's natural, to river coloured water, the probable consequence of some streams falling into the bay, or into the ocean to the north of it, through the low land."],"George Vecsey":["War of attrition, war of wills. That's what the Stanley Cup playoffs are - more intense, more physical and more prolonged than the playoffs of any other sport.","All our lives are enriched by the leadership and excellence and confidence of female athletes, whether the Mia Hamms and Maya Moores we know or the field hockey, lacrosse and track and field athletes we do not necessarily know.","I never watch 'Sopranos' reruns back home. As far as I am concerned, the nuclear family is still sitting around the luncheonette in New Jersey, munching and chatting, safe and together, and that's how it ended for me.","Without editors planning assignments and copy editors fixing mistakes, reporters quickly deteriorate into underwear guys writing blogs from their den.","It's a Stanley Cup thing. The boys mangle one another for a series, performing all kinds of nasty tricks, then they make nice, shaking soggy hands as the teams shuffle in opposite directions.","Tom Seaver was let loose twice by the Mets and pitched a no-hitter for the Reds and won his 300th game for the White Sox, but he wears a Mets cap in the Hall of Fame as homage to the 1969 championship.","Hockey lends itself to special events, including the Olympic competition: a glorious tournament of the best players in the world, putting on their national jerseys and playing on big rinks with no-goon Olympic rules and referee enforcement.","For years, I advised George Steinbrenner to get out of town because he dishonored my hometown with his bullying and bombast.","When Sweden's Jan-Ove Waldner travels to China to play table tennis, he is mobbed when he leaves his hotel as if he were a rock star walking around Manhattan or a soccer star walking around Europe.","Hockey suffers from being compared to itself in ways that other sports are not. Every four years, some of us fawn over Olympic hockey, a great event with bigger rinks, minimal goonishness and national pride in addition to the heightened skills of veritable all-star squads.","I've seen elbows that broke eye sockets. I've seen a German goalkeeper just level a French guy. His teammates thought he was dead lying on the ground. This was in 1982 at my first World Cup. But a bite is outside any kind of contact collision: dirty foul play. A bite is a bite.","Ball caps travel far and wide. They do far more than keep the sun out of your eyes or the cold off your head. Ball caps are a statement.","Most descriptions make Beijing sound overbuilt: not a blade of grass left.","Under a pulsating full moon, the gussied-up Billie Jean King National Tennis Center seems much softer and prettier at night, with the fountains bubbling and fans without tickets to the big stadium sitting in the plaza and watching a big screen.","When the Mets were on their run in the 1980s, Gary Carter was often seen hugging somebody. It was easy to joke about that. The best hug of all was with Jesse Orosco at the end of the 1986 World Series.","In the late '60s, Senator Charles E. Goodell, Republican of New York, spoke out against the Vietnam War, bringing on the wrath of the Nixon administration and, as it turned out, the disaffection of conservative voters.","Having been aware of the Red Sox since the 1946 World Series, having been growled at by Ted Williams as a young reporter in 1960, having been present at the horror of 1986 and the comeback of 2004, I have seen the highs and lows of some other people's favorite team.","FIFA is a vuvuzela. It's in your ear, but you don't want to hear it, and then eventually it goes away.","Some anthems are great for sports. You've got the Russian national anthem... 'O Canada,' how wonderful is that for hockey... but I chose the Italian national song because at my first World Cup, I saw the Italians play four times, and they won all four times - they won the championship.","There is always a group of death in any World Cup. And it's a complement in a way to be in a group of death because it means that you're a good team also.","What I like about it is the creativity. When I watch good soccer players - the way they have to make a play out of nothing.","I would never tell anybody to give up hockey - the great sports we have here - basketball, lacrosse - rugby coming into its own - we've got so many great team sports, and I say hold on to them.","Many American players - Paul Caligiuri, Claudio Reyna, Eric Wynalda, Kasey Keller, Tony Sanneh, Michael Bradley and Steve Cherundolo, just a partial list - have sought the income and challenge of Germany.","There may not be much future for the kind of sports column I did.","Newspapers are the engines that drive the Web.","In that prehistoric time, before the Internet, before information floated in the ozone, I was a soccer novice who had never heard of Socrates until somebody pointed him out - swarthy, shaggy, tall, slender, mysterious.","Into La Bombonera danced the most agile, rhythmic, beautiful, sensuous people I have ever seen. And that was just the fans.","There is only one thing wrong about the Flo Hyman Award: it came to be named for the Old Lady of Volleyball much too soon.","Flo Hyman became America's best-known volleyball player with a faulty aorta, but she did not know it.","Lots of ballplayers have their own personal music blasted by the sound systems in modern ball parks.","I know, I know - men have that extra hero gene in their foolish makeup; it's part of our charm. But I happen to know some women who have their inner sports hero, too.","I love Boston. I love Fenway Park. I love Red Sox history. But in no way am I a Red Sox fan.","For years, I have been harboring memories of my first major league game at a place named Ebbets Field in Brooklyn.","Sure, there were people from Missouri and Illinois who grew up Cardinals fans and migrated to New York for work or love. Cardinals fans congregate periodically at Foley's near Herald Square to root for the team of their childhood, up there on the TV screen.","In New York, I run into Packers fans who have never lived in Wisconsin, Canadiens fans who have never lived in La Belle Province, Celtics fans who admire Russell and Bird and Pierce but have no trace of a Boston accent.","When I was a kid, my father brought home the autobiography of Sid Luckman, the great Chicago Bears quarterback - probably an extra copy from the sports department where he worked. It was the first sports biography I ever read.","To this day, while maintaining a healthy respect for the Giants and Jets and other teams I cover, I admit to checking the results every Monday to see how the Bears did.","Yankee caps pop up all over the world, not as a statement of loyalty to that team, but as a symbol of - what? Winning 27 so-called World Series? Much of the world doesn't even play that sport.","Many of the most successful coaches and managers have come from players who never reached the highest level. The one exception seems to be basketball, where many of the greatest stars at least tried to coach a team.","What is there about basketball that makes Larry Bird or Lenny Wilkens want to coach after their playing careers are done?","Fans all have their memories of pennant races, good memories, sick memories.","Pennant races drain the energy from the best of them. Old-fashioned baseball races are to me the most grueling daily test in any sport. Gotta keep coming out, every day, in the face of looming disaster.","As my wife will attest, I do not shop casually.","There is nothing wrong with athletes coming back from retirement.","Three of the brightest baseball pitchers of their times staged comebacks without much success - David Cone, Jim Bouton and Jim Palmer - but there was room to admire their quixotic gesture.","Personal honors never meant much to Bill Russell, one of America's most successful athletes with 2 college titles, 1 Olympic gold medal and 11 - count 'em, 11 - N.B.A. championships with the Boston Celtics.","Whether or not anybody had invented the category in his lifetime, Babe Ruth was surely the Greatest Living Yankee almost immediately upon lofting home runs at the Polo Grounds, allowing the Yankees to build their own palace across the Harlem River.","The Greatest Living Yankee is Whitey Ford, who came out of Aviation High School, which was then in Manhattan, and helped pitch the Yankees to victory in the 1950 World Series when he was 21.","I say the Islanders were the best team I ever covered because they had more so many stars who delivered with Canadian-Swedish-suburban modesty. And they won four straight Stanley Cups from 1980 through 1983.","I love hockey because of the respect for history and for the game itself.","In North America, many fans know Cristiano Ronaldo's smirk and can recognize Didier Drogba in a commercial. Maybe they know too much for the good of M.L.S.","I love Major League Soccer, covered the first game in 1996 in a funky stadium in San Jose, and I applaud just about every move that its commissioners, Garber and Doug Logan, have made.","The Boys of Summer were heroes in Brooklyn for a full postwar decade partly because the players could not entertain higher offers.","Baseball's postseason shifts from game to game because of starting pitchers and the geography of the ballparks.","The football playoffs feature one-off affairs, without bad feelings building from weekend to weekend. In addition, football uses platoons for offense and defense and kicking, so only the interior linemen have a chance to really get up close and personal with one another.","I've seen fire, and I've seen rain. I've also had to scramble over tundra to get to the Super Bowl and seen baseball turf fields that could fry a fielder's soles.","Lance Armstrong has joined the legion of the lost, the great athletes who were barred or exiled for sins admitted or charged or suspected.","Every spring, this happens: People discover hockey when daylight lasts longer and men grow beards and tie games do not end in shootouts but rather continue until a goal is scored. The seventh game only heightens the mood for players and fans alike.","Certain Stanley Cup traditions remain intact, including the handshake line between players who had been belting one another for a couple of weeks.","We all understand the economics of the Super Bowl - 10 or 12 minutes of the ball in motion will be stretched into three and a half hours or more of money-making commercials.","This occasional sports columnist, who has been to his share of Super Bowls, had been glad to be home on Super Bowl Sunday, but the scary commercials made me want to be in the melee of the arena, where you are not aware of commercials.","Television is making sports universal; for the same reason, big-time soccer is growing more popular in the United States.","Why is the N.F.L. so popular? The N.F.L. grew in the comfort zone after World War II. People had money and time. A popular American sport got bigger.","I will always treasure the privilege of writing the 'Sports of The Times' column.","I proposed abolishing boxing because it was bad for the brain, but boxers were generally so decent that I loved being around the gyms.","I never worried about getting stale because the news and the people induce freshness every working hour.","In recent generations, women's sports have been a blessing. Some of us can remember the bad old days in the '50s, when we would discover in casual schoolyard play that a girl could outrun most of us or hold her own in basketball or hit a softball - but there were no teams, no coaches, for girls.","Title IX, whether voluntarily or via court cases, opened gymnasiums to women, produced uniforms and schedules and buses.","For good reasons, there are no ties during the Stanley Cup season. Somebody needs to win so the lads can get out to their cottages on the lakes, where all hockey players spend their summers, or so I have been told.","Weary soccer players just cannot run anymore and must resort to shootouts after 120 minutes when a result is mandatory, but men on skates can go indefinitely, no matter how badly it disrupts the television network's schedule.","Some of us love hockey not just for its ferocity and skill but for its underlying code of civility off the ice.","Sometimes, sport is just plain pleasing to the eye, like watching La Belle France flit by on television during the Tour de France. I can do that for hours.","Nobody has ever called Shea Stadium a cathedral. In style, it was more like the old warehouse or outdated movie theater that Korean worshippers have transformed into a church in the borough of Queens. Not a cathedral - but a place where people go to be fulfilled, nonetheless.","We all know the Red Sox did not win a World Series for 86 years after unloading Ruth, and the Cubs just might be carrying some heavy weight for past karmic transgressions.","It needs to be said, over and over again, that Stan the Man was voted by 'The Sporting News' as the best baseball player of the postwar decade, from 1946 through 1955.","When I was working on the unauthorized biography 'Stan Musial: An American Life,' which came out in 2011, old opponents recalled how Musial knew their names after they had been in the majors only a few days.","Some people insist that hallowed professional teams should never change their nicknames.","Night tennis began at the United States Open in 1975 with certain stars trying to beg out and certain patrons trying to dump unwanted tickets on scalpers.","In New York, Kid Carter was pure vanilla for a city with stronger tastes.","Some religious guys in sports give the impression, 'I've got something you don't have.'","Some great players, like Ted Williams and Stan Musial, had one more great hitting season left around the age of 40.","In August 1945, a former Army pilot with an artificial leg pitched five and a third innings for Washington against Boston. This would turn out to be Bert Shepard's only major league game, and it remains one of the heartwarming moments in baseball history.","In 1949, I saw a World War II veteran named Lou Brissie, who had nearly lost a lower leg in combat, pitch in the All-Star Game in Brooklyn.","Hundreds of ballplayers have performed well after Tommy John surgery, in which an elbow ligament is replaced by material from elsewhere on the body. More and more, athletes will perform with a bit of this or a bit of that in a joint or muscle.","Some of the most inspiring moments in sports have come from players with physical defects. Tom Dempsey, born without toes on his right foot, kicked a 63-yard field goal in 1970, using a straighter, wider shoe.","One of the most beautiful sights in my neighborhood is on High Holy Days when people walk to temple. Not only does this bring the traditional legendary weather, but it gives off a psychic signal to slow down.","Baseball cannot avoid conflicts. Games are played on Good Friday, the most solemn day on the Christian calendar. On Oct. 2, 1978, they played on Rosh Hashana, and Bucky Dent hit one into the screen at Fenway Park. Supply your own moral.","It is hard to imagine the World Series being held in the sweet hazy sunshine of late September rather than the sour night air of late October, but that is precisely what has transpired in baseball over the past 50 years, a deterioration from light to darkness.","Youth sports could not exist without millions of volunteers and modestly paid coaches who teach our children how to skate and catch and dribble and also how to get along with others.","When Casey Stengel was putting his mark on all four New York baseball teams, he came off as many things. I have to admit I never thought of him as anybody's uncle.","Stanley Cup hockey comes around every year, when games start to count in multiples of best-of-seven series, and the players seem to put more attention into every pass, every check, every annoying little trick.","Athletes are used to battling. The public would never learn their names if professional athletes had not shown courage at an early age. They learn they can overcome, but sometimes this becomes a false sense of security that leads them to the edge.","No matter how many times it happens, the public always seems to be shocked when an athlete dies young, but the reality is, there are no promises.","It is no fun lining up in your own building - as the hockey players say - and touching the hands of fellow stubbly louts who have just sent you off to the proverbial cabin on the lake.","Hockey historians say the handshake dates to English settlers in Canada, who preached an upper-class version of sportsmanship in the 19th century. Soon, tough kids in urban and prairie rinks began imitating imagined dukes and earls of the old country."],"George Villiers":["The world's a forest, in which all lose their way; though by a different path each goes astray.","What the devil does the plot signify, except to bring in fine things?","And as they pass, turn back and laugh at me.","Good wits will jump.","Men's fame is like their hair, which grows after they are dead, and with just as little use to them.","Make my breast transparent as pure crystal, that the world, jealous of me, may see the foulest thought my heart does hold."],"George Voinovich":["The economy is showing encouraging signs of recovery.","Liberating Iraq from a legacy of violence and putting it on the path to peace and prosperity will take time.","I do not want our children and grandchildren to live in a world where everyday they fear some regional strongman with weapons of mass destruction. We need to send a message to these future would-be bullies: you will not be allowed to threaten the world.","I want to make it clear publicly that I expect more candor from this Administration during the next four years, particularly with members on the Foreign Relations Committee so that we can maintain a bipartisan foreign policy.","I don't give a damn about the stock market. But I do care about jobs.","I don't understand why people in this country are so bent on doing the 'perfect', when you have something that is good and makes sense from a cost-benefit point of view.","It is time to recognize a simple fact of life. Contrary to what some of my colleagues seem to believe, tax cuts do not pay for themselves."],"George W. Bush":["This was not an act of terrorism, but it was an act of war.","America is the land of the second chance - and when the gates of the prison open, the path ahead should lead to a better life.","Leadership to me means duty, honor, country. It means character, and it means listening from time to time.","Freedom itself was attacked this morning by a faceless coward, and freedom will be defended.","We've climbed the mighty mountain. I see the valley below, and it's a valley of peace.","We will not waver; we will not tire; we will not falter, and we will not fail. Peace and Freedom will prevail.","We will stand up for our friends in the world. And one of the most important friends is the State of Israel. My administration will be steadfast in support Israel against terrorism and violence, and in seeking the peace for which all Israelis pray.","America is a Nation with a mission - and that mission comes from our most basic beliefs. We have no desire to dominate, no ambitions of empire. Our aim is a democratic peace - a peace founded upon the dignity and rights of every man and woman.","Terrorist attacks can shake the foundations of our biggest buildings, but they cannot touch the foundation of America. These acts shatter steel, but they cannot dent the steel of American resolve.","One of my proudest moments is I didn't sell my soul for the sake of popularity.","For diplomacy to be effective, words must be credible - and no one can now doubt the word of America.","Some folks look at me and see a certain swagger, which in Texas is called 'walking.'","It's clearly a budget. It's got a lot of numbers in it.","There's no bigger task than protecting the homeland of our country.","America must not ignore the threat gathering against us. Facing clear evidence of peril, we cannot wait for the final proof, the smoking gun that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud.","Faith crosses every border and touches every heart in every nation.","The action we take and the decisions we make in this decade will have consequences far into this century. If America shows weakness and uncertainty, the world will drift toward tragedy. That will not happen on my watch.","I want to thank you for taking time out of your day to come and witness my hanging.","To those of you who received honours, awards and distinctions, I say well done. And to the C students, I say you, too, can be president of the United States.","Great tragedy has come to us, and we are meeting it with the best that is in our country, with courage and concern for others because this is America. This is who we are.","I have a different vision of leadership. A leadership is someone who brings people together.","The true history of my administration will be written 50 years from now, and you and I will not be around to see it.","The wisest use of American strength is to advance freedom.","You can fool some of the people all the time, and those are the ones you want to concentrate on.","On September 11 2001, America felt its vulnerability even to threats that gather on the other side of the Earth. We resolved then, and we are resolved today, to confront every threat from any source that could bring sudden terror and suffering to America.","I can hear you, the rest of the world can hear you and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.","The terrorists and their supporters declared war on the United States - and war is what they got.","We cannot let terrorists hold this nation hostile or hold our allies hostile.","I know it's going to be the private sector that leads this country out of the current economic times we're in. You can spend your money better than the government can spend your money.","You teach a child to read, and he or her will be able to pass a literacy test.","The momentum of freedom in our world is unmistakable - and it is not carried forward by our power alone. We can trust in that greater power Who guides the unfolding of the years. And in all that is to come, we can know that His purposes are just and true.","Use power to help people. For we are given power not to advance our own purposes nor to make a great show in the world, nor a name. There is but one just use of power and it is to serve people.","The financial crisis should not become an excuse to raise taxes, which would only undermine the economic growth required to regain our strength.","And what's interesting, and I don't think a lot of Americans understand this fact, is that, one, most new jobs are created by small businesses; two, most small businesses pay tax at the individual income tax, or many small businesses pay tax there.","I believe that God has planted in every heart the desire to live in freedom.","The terrorists are fighting freedom with all their cunning and cruelty because freedom is their greatest fear - and they should be afraid, because freedom is on the march.","People forget... that we structured it so that the government, or the people, would be repaid with a really good rate of return. And as it turns out, that aspect of TARP, that's what happened.","The men and women of Afghanistan are building a nation that is free, and proud, and fighting terror - and America is honored to be their friend.","When you turn your heart and your life over to Christ, when you accept Christ as the savior, it changes your heart.","After the chaos and carnage of September 11th, it is not enough to serve our enemies with legal papers.","Bring them on.","I had to abandon free market principles in order to save the free market system.","Our nation must come together to unite.","I have zero desire, just so you know, to be in the limelight. I don't think it's good for the country to have a former president criticize his successor. You're not going to see me giving my opinions in the public arena, until I start selling my book. I'm going to emerge then submerge.","So, for example, a country was into recession right after I was sworn in, a dot-com bust had taken place. Then the attacks of September the 11th, and then of course the great financial meltdown in the -the fundamental question facing any presidency is how do you deal with the hand you're dealt?","Any government that supports, protects or harbours terrorists is complicit in the murder of the innocent and equally guilty of terrorist crimes.","We can't allow the world's worst leaders to blackmail, threaten, hold freedom-loving nations hostage with the world's worst weapons.","We know that dictators are quick to choose aggression, while free nations strive to resolve differences in peace.","It is clear our nation is reliant upon big foreign oil. More and more of our imports come from overseas.","People make suggestions on what to say all the time. I'll give you an example; I don't read what's handed to me. People say, 'Here, here's your speech, or here's an idea for a speech.' They're changed. Trust me.","The resolve of our great nation is being tested. But make no mistake, we will show the world that we will pass the test.","We will build new ships to carry man forward into the universe, to gain a new foothold on the moon and to prepare for new journeys to the worlds beyond our own.","Hundreds of thousands of American servicemen and women are deployed across the world in the war on terror. By bringing hope to the oppressed, and delivering justice to the violent, they are making America more secure.","Every nation in every region now has a decision to make. Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.","Americans are rising to the tasks of history, and they expect the same of us.","I understand everybody in this country doesn't agree with the decisions I've made. And I made some tough decisions. But people know where I stand.","Free nations are peaceful nations. Free nations don't attack each other. Free nations don't develop weapons of mass destruction.","No one was more shocked or angry than I was when we didn't find the weapons. I had a sickening feeling every time I thought about it. I still do.","Saddam Hussein is a homicidal dictator who is addicted to weapons of mass destruction.","Iraq is no diversion. It is a place where civilization is taking a decisive stand against chaos and terror, we must not waver.","I believe the most solemn duty of the American president is to protect the American people. If America shows uncertainty and weakness in this decade, the world will drift toward tragedy. This will not happen on my watch.","Today we affirm a new commitment to live out our nation's promise through civility, courage, compassion and character.","The United States of America will never be intimidated by thugs and assassins. The killers will fail, and the Iraqi people will live in freedom.","This way of life is worth defending.","A dictatorship would be a heck of a lot easier, there's no question about it.","The legislature's job is to write law. It's the executive branch's job to interpret law.","Government does not create wealth. The major role for the government is to create an environment where people take risks to expand the job rate in the United States.","The United States and our allies are determined: we refuse to live in the shadow of this ultimate danger.","States should have the right to enact laws... particularly to end the inhumane practice of ending a life that otherwise could live.","You can't put democracy and freedom back into a box.","With those attacks, the terrorists and their supporters declared war on the United States. And war is what they got.","Everywhere that freedom stirs, let tyrants fear.","The tyrant has fallen, and Iraq is free.","It's going to be the year of the sharp elbow and the quick tongue.","Natural gas is hemispheric. I like to call it hemispheric in nature because it is a product that we can find in our neighborhoods.","I believe a marriage is between a man and a woman.","The California crunch really is the result of not enough power-generating plants and then not enough power to power the power of generating plants.","I just didn't want to get out there anymore; I didn't want to get back into what I call 'the swamp.' And the other reason why is I don't think it's good for the presidency for a former president to be opining about his successor. President Obama's got plenty of critics - and I'm just not gonna be one.","If you're sick and tired of the politics of cynicism and polls and principles, come and join this campaign.","I'm hopeful. I know there is a lot of ambition in Washington, obviously. But I hope the ambitious realize that they are more likely to succeed with success as opposed to failure.","The deliberate and deadly attacks which were carried out yesterday against our country were more than acts of terror. They were acts of war.","We will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbour them.","America is a friend to the people of Iraq. Our demands are directed only at the regime that enslaves them and threatens us. When these demands are met, the first and greatest benefit will come to Iraqi men, women and children.","Some have argued that confronting the threat from Iraq could detract from the war against terror. To the contrary, confronting the threat posed by Iraq is crucial to winning the war on terror.","The course of this conflict is not known, yet its outcome is certain. Freedom and fear, justice and cruelty, have always been at war, and we know that God is not neutral between them.","When I take action, I'm not going to fire a $2 million missile at a $10 empty tent and hit a camel in the butt. It's going to be decisive.","Do I think faith will be an important part of being a good president? Yes, I do.","I think you can judge from somebody's actions a kind of a stability and sense of purpose perhaps created by strong religious roots. I mean, there's a certain patience, a certain discipline, I think, that religion helps you achieve.","Now, there are some who would like to rewrite history - revisionist historians is what I like to call them.","The once all-powerful ruler of Iraq was found in a hole, and now sits in a prison cell.","For all who love freedom and peace, the world without Saddam Hussein's regime is a better and safer place.","Our Nation must defend the sanctity of marriage.","I sent American troops to Iraq to make its people free, not to make them American. Iraqis will write their own history and find their own way.","This young century will be liberty's century.","I will never relent in defending America - whatever it takes.","I believe in the transformational power of liberty. I believe that the free Iraq is in this nation's interests. I believe a free Afghanistan is in this nation's interest.","The United States prefers that Iraq meet its obligations voluntarily, yet we are prepared for the alternative.","America will never seek a permission slip to defend the security of our people.","Senator Kerry has been in Washington long enough to take both sides on just about every issue.","Only a liberal senator from Massachusetts would say that a 49 percent increase in funding for education was not enough.","I just want you to know that, when we talk about war, we're really talking about peace.","I think we ought to raise the age at which juveniles can have a gun.","We don't believe in planners and deciders making the decisions on behalf of Americans.","I am mindful not only of preserving executive powers for myself, but for predecessors as well."],"George W. Romney":["Our body is the temple of our spirit.","Extremism in defense of liberty is not a vice, but I denounce political extremism, of the left or the right, based on duplicity, falsehood, fear, violence and threats when they endanger liberty.","My wife has been my greatest earthly inspiration. She excels in eloquence, the poetry of words, empathy and graciousness.","Workers must participate in progress to enjoy their work and take pride in its product.","Too often, young people who are just bursting with idealism either find themselves playing a game for which they have little heart or are hurling themselves into wasteful protests against the so-called Establishment.","We need leadership that can elevate religion and morality to their position of paramount importance and thus eliminate growing selfishness, immorality and materialism.","Prayer is not a substitute for work. First we have to do all we can ourselves to understand a situation. Then when we ask for help, sometimes it is very evident, sometimes it isn't. Sometimes we may well be helped by not getting a decision.","My religion is my most precious possession. Except for it, I could easily have become excessively occupied with industry. Sharing responsibility for church work has been a vital counterbalance in my life.","Dogmatic ideological parties tend to splinter the political and social fabric of a nation.","The rights of some must not be enjoyed by denying the rights of others. Neither can we permit states' rights at the expense of human rights.","I'm concerned about truth and credibility in government.","Too often we shape our public positions on the basis of our economic connections. That brings us dangerously close to economic determinism.","It is morally, politically and socially wrong for business as business or labor as labor to participate directly in politics.","I would never sacrifice my individual beliefs as a citizen to my corporate responsibilities.","You can't be too right too soon and win elections."],"George W. S. Trow":["I have made sense of my life by developing an ability to analyze Mainstream American Cultural Artifacts.","The most powerful men were those who most effectively used the power of adult competence to enforce childish agreements.","The work of television is to establish false contexts and to chronicle the unraveling of existing contexts; finally, to establish the context of no-context and to chronicle it.","Wonder was the grace of the country. Any action could be justified by that: the wonder it was rooted in. Period followed period, and finally the wonder was that things could be built so big. Bridges, skyscrapers, fortunes, all having a life first in the marketplace, still drew on the force of wonder.","Children are the beneficiaries - and also the victims - of the theater of various moments.","Irony has seeped into the felt of any fedora hat I have ever owned - not out of any wish of mine, but out of necessity. A fedora hat worn by me without the necessary protective irony would eat through my head and kill me.","To a person growing up in the power of demography, it was clear that history had to do not with the powerful actions of certain men but with the processes of choice and preference.","It is in many circumstances a troubling thing to belong to the advanced class of a backward nation. One surrenders coherence and begins a difficult process of choice which ends, often, in an eclectic idiosyncrasy.","For members of a traditional society where many traditions have been discredited, an interest in modernity can result in a restless sophistication. Mehmet Ertegun seems not to have been a restless man.","The Turkish Embassy in Washington is an ornate, eclectic building on the corner of Twenty-third Street and Massachusetts Avenue which was built originally for Edward Hamlin Everett, the man who put the crimp in bottle caps.","Mehmet Ertegun died in 1944. President Roosevelt sent his body back to Turkey on the U.S.S. Missouri. Mehmet Ertegun and President Roosevelt had had a cordial relationship, and, indeed, Mehmet Ertegun may have helped insure that Turkey did not ally itself with Germany, as it had in the First World War.","It is the idea of 'People' to treat its material as if it were history and, what is more, as if it were the history of a happy period.","Literary men now routinely tell their readers about their divorces. One literary man who reviews books wrote, in reviewing a study of Ruskin, that he had never read a book by Ruskin but that the study confirmed him in his belief that he didn't want to read a book by Ruskin. This man very often writes about his family life."],"George Wald":["Nuclear weapons offer us nothing but a balance of terror, and a balance of terror is still terror.","The only use for an atomic bomb is to keep somebody else from using one.","A lecture is much more of a dialogue than many of you probably realize.","Dropping those atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was a war crime.","We are the products of editing, rather than of authorship.","I have lived much of my life among molecules. They are good company.","There's life all over this universe, but the only life in the solar system is on earth, and in the whole universe we are the only men.","There is nothing worth having that can be obtained by nuclear war - nothing material or ideological - no tradition that it can defend. It is utterly self-defeating.","As you lecture, you keep watching the faces, and information keeps coming back to you all the time.","I tell my students to try to know molecules, so well that when they have some question involving molecules, they can ask themselves, What would I do if I were that molecule?","It would be a poor thing to be an atom in a universe without physicists, and physicists are made of atoms. A physicist is an atom's way of knowing about atoms.","A physicist is an atom's way of knowing about atoms.","We've committed many war crimes in Vietnam - but I'll tell you something interesting about that. We were committing war crimes in World War II, before the Nuremberg trials were held and the principle of war crimes was stated.","I am growing old, and my future, so to speak, is already behind me.","You see, every creature alive on the earth today represents an unbroken line of life that stretches back to the first primitive organism to appear on this planet; and that is about three billion years.","We have to get rid of those nuclear weapons.","We have fallen in love with the body. That's that thing that looks back at us from the mirror. That's the repository of that lovely identity that you keep chasing all your life.","To know reality is to accept it, and eventually to love it.","The Vietnamese have a secret weapon. It's their willingness to die beyond our willingness to kill. In effect, they've been saying, You can kill us, but you'll have to kill a lot of us; you may have to kill all of us. And, thank heaven, we are not yet ready to do that.","The trouble with most of the things that people want is that they get them.","The thought that we're in competition with Russians or with Chinese is all a mistake, and trivial. We are one species, with a world to win.","The only point of government is to safeguard and foster life.","The Nobel Prize is an honor unique in the world in having found its way into the hearts and minds of simple people everywhere. It casts a light of peace and reason upon us all; and for that I am especially grateful.","The concept of war crimes is an American invention.","Since we have had a history, men have pursued an ideal of immortality.","Science goes from question to question; big questions, and little, tentative answers. The questions as they age grow ever broader, the answers are seen to be more limited.","Our business is with life, not death.","It's not good enough to give it tender, loving care, to supply it with breakfast foods, to buy it expensive educations. Those things don't mean anything unless this generation has a future. And we're not sure that it does.","In fact, death seems to have been a rather late invention in evolution. One can go a long way in evolution before encountering an authentic corpse.","I think all of you know there is no adequate defense against massive nuclear attack.","I tell my students to try early in life to find an unattainable objective.","As far as I know, the most conservative estimates of the number of Americans who would be killed in a major nuclear attack, with everything working as well as can be hoped and all foreseeable precautions taken, run to about fifty million.","And, you see, we are living in a world in which all wars are wars of defense.","All War Departments are now Defense Departments. This is all part of the doubletalk of our time. The aggressor is always on the other side.","A scientist should be the happiest of men.","A scientist lives with all reality. There is nothing better.","A scientist is in a sense a learned small boy. There is something of the scientist in every small boy. Others must outgrow it. Scientists can stay that way all their lives.","A peacetime draft is the most un-American thing I know."],"George Wallace":["We must not be misled by left-wing incompetent news media that, day after day, feed us a diet of fantasy telling us we are bigots, racists and hate-mongers.","I draw the line in the dust and toss the gauntlet before the feet of tyranny, and I say Segregation now! Segregation tomorrow! Segregation forever!","It's good that segregation is over.","My vehemence was against the federal courts. I never said a word against black people in my heart since I ran for governor.","I love black people, I love white people, I love yellow people.","The average citizen in this county has more intelligence and sense in his little finger than the editor of 'The New York Times' has in his whole head.","Let us rise to the call of freedom-loving blood that is in us, and send our answer to the tyranny that clanks its chains upon the South.","I am having nothing to do with this so-called civil rights bill. The liberal left-wingers have passed it. Now let them employ some pinknik social engineers in Washington, D.C., to figure out what to do with it.","I don't support white supremacy. I'm the one who made them take 'white supremacy' off the roster that was the symbol of the Democratic Party in this state.","It's what the people wanted at the time, but the country could not be half-segregated and half-integrated, just as it could not be half-slave and half-free back in the 1800s.","The court today, just as in 1776, is deaf to the voices of the people and their repeated entreaties: they have become arrogant, contemptuous, highhanded, and literal despots.","When I first ran for governor... I had to stand up for segregation or be defeated, but I never insulted black people by calling them inferior.","Blacks gave me a standing ovation when they put the cap and gown on me, and that was the proudest I've ever been.","I did nothing worse than Lyndon Johnson. He was for segregation when he thought he had to be. I was for segregation, and I was wrong. The media has rehabilitated Johnson; why won't it rehabilitate me?","I've never said that you should have segregation of the school system or any other.","My one wish before I die is to talk to Bremer. I want to find out who he did it for. He did it for somebody else.","Tell the people... please, tell the people of Alabama that I love them. Tell them I'm suffering a lot, but I love them.","I don't expect people to forget my brash words or deeds. But I ask that they try to remember the actions that I took that were designed to help them.","I am going to give the moral support of the presidency to the police and firemen.","It seems that other parts of the world ought to be concerned about what we think of them instead of what they think of us. After all, we're feeding most of them, and whenever they start rejecting 25 cents of each dollar of foreign aid money that we send to them, then I'll be concerned about their attitude toward us.","It's a sad day in this country when you can't talk about law and order unless they want to call you a racist.","I am not about to be a party to anything having to do with the law that is going to destroy individual freedom and liberty in this country.","As I have said before, that Federal Penal Code could never have been enacted into law if we had had a responsible press who was willing to tell the American people the truth about what it actually provides. Nor would we have had a bill had it not been for the United States Supreme Court."],"George Washington Cable":["Everybody knows the Lord loveth a cheerful giver.","And in the afternoon they entered a land - but such a land! A land hung in mourning, darkened by gigantic cypresses, submerged; a land of reptiles, silence, shadow, decay.","There came to port last Sunday night the queerest little craft, without an inch of rigging on; I looked and looked - and laughed. It seemed so curious that she should cross the unknown water, and moor herself within my room - my daughter! O my daughter!"],"George Washington Carver":["Education is the key to unlock the golden door of freedom.","Nothing is more beautiful than the loveliness of the woods before sunrise.","Ninety-nine percent of the failures come from people who have the habit of making excuses.","Where there is no vision, there is no hope.","It is not the style of clothes one wears, neither the kind of automobile one drives, nor the amount of money one has in the bank, that counts. These mean nothing. It is simply service that measures success.","How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving and tolerant of the weak and strong. Because someday in your life you will have been all of these.","There is no short cut to achievement. Life requires thorough preparation - veneer isn't worth anything.","When you can do the common things of life in an uncommon way, you will command the attention of the world.","Reading about nature is fine, but if a person walks in the woods and listens carefully, he can learn more than what is in books, for they speak with the voice of God.","I wanted to know the name of every stone and flower and insect and bird and beast. I wanted to know where it got its color, where it got its life - but there was no one to tell me.","Anything will give up its secrets if you love it enough. Not only have I found that when I talk to the little flower or to the little peanut they will give up their secrets, but I have found that when I silently commune with people, they give up their secrets also - if you love them enough.","No individual has any right to come into the world and go out of it without leaving behind him distinct and legitimate reasons for having passed through it.","Since new developments are the products of a creative mind, we must therefore stimulate and encourage that type of mind in every way possible.","I love to think of nature as an unlimited broadcasting station, through which God speaks to us every hour, if we will only tune in.","We have become 99 percent money mad. The method of living at home modestly and within our income, laying a little by systematically for the proverbial rainy day which is due to come, can almost be listed among the lost arts.","God cannot use you as He wishes until you come into the fullness of His Glory. Do not get alarmed, my friend, when doubts creep in. That is old Satan. Pray, pray, pray.","Fear of something is at the root of hate for others, and hate within will eventually destroy the hater.","When our thoughts - which bring actions - are filled with hate against anyone, Negro or white, we are in a living hell. That is as real as hell will ever be.","No books ever go into my laboratory. The thing I am to do and the way are revealed to me the moment I am inspired to create something new. Without God to draw aside the curtain, I would be helpless. Only alone can I draw close enough to God to discover His secrets.","Our creator is the same and never changes despite the names given Him by people here and in all parts of the world. Even if we gave Him no name at all, He would still be there, within us, waiting to give us good on this earth.","Years ago I went into my laboratory and said, 'Dear Mr. Creator, please tell me what the universe was made for?' The Great Creator answered, 'You want to know too much for that little mind of yours. Ask for something more your size, little man.'","Human need is really a great spiritual vacuum which God seeks to fill... With one hand in the hand of a fellow man in need and the other in the hand of Christ, He could get across the vacuum.","I would never allow anyone to give me money, no difference how badly I needed it. I wanted literally to earn my living.","From a child, I had an inordinate desire for knowledge and especially music, painting, flowers, and the sciences, Algebra being one of my favorite studies.","If you love it enough, anything will talk with you."],"George Washington":["Guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism.","It is far better to be alone, than to be in bad company.","To be prepared for war is one of the most effective means of preserving peace.","If the freedom of speech is taken away then dumb and silent we may be led, like sheep to the slaughter.","Observe good faith and justice toward all nations. Cultivate peace and harmony with all.","Truth will ultimately prevail where there is pains to bring it to light.","The Constitution is the guide which I never will abandon.","Happiness and moral duty are inseparably connected.","It is better to offer no excuse than a bad one.","Liberty, when it begins to take root, is a plant of rapid growth.","True friendship is a plant of slow growth, and must undergo and withstand the shocks of adversity, before it is entitled to the appellation.","My first wish is to see this plague of mankind, war, banished from the earth.","Worry is the interest paid by those who borrow trouble.","Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire, called conscience.","Discipline is the soul of an army. It makes small numbers formidable; procures success to the weak, and esteem to all.","Associate with men of good quality if you esteem your own reputation; for it is better to be alone than in bad company.","It is better to be alone than in bad company.","We should not look back unless it is to derive useful lessons from past errors, and for the purpose of profiting by dearly bought experience.","Be courteous to all, but intimate with few, and let those few be well tried before you give them your confidence.","The basis of our political system is the right of the people to make and to alter their constitutions of government.","Let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. Reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.","Mankind, when left to themselves, are unfit for their own government.","The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism.","Let us raise a standard to which the wise and honest can repair; the rest is in the hands of God.","Arbitrary power is most easily established on the ruins of liberty abused to licentiousness.","I have no other view than to promote the public good, and am unambitious of honors not founded in the approbation of my Country.","When we assumed the Soldier, we did not lay aside the Citizen.","Laws made by common consent must not be trampled on by individuals.","There is nothing which can better deserve your patronage, than the promotion of science and literature. Knowledge is in every country the surest basis of public happiness.","Few men have virtue to withstand the highest bidder.","It will be found an unjust and unwise jealousy to deprive a man of his natural liberty upon the supposition he may abuse it.","The time is near at hand which must determine whether Americans are to be free men or slaves.","Some day, following the example of the United States of America, there will be a United States of Europe.","I hope I shall possess firmness and virtue enough to maintain what I consider the most enviable of all titles, the character of an honest man.","I can only say that there is not a man living who wishes more sincerely than I do, to see a plan adopted for the abolition of it - but there is only one proper and effectual mode by which it can be accomplished, and that is by Legislative authority: and this, as far as my suffrage will go, shall never be wanting.","It may be laid down as a primary position, and the basis of our system, that every Citizen who enjoys the protection of a Free Government, owes not only a proportion of his property, but even of his personal services to the defense of it.","Experience teaches us that it is much easier to prevent an enemy from posting themselves than it is to dislodge them after they have got possession.","Friendship is a plant of slow growth and must undergo and withstand the shocks of adversity before it is entitled to the appellation.","The constitution vests the power of declaring war in Congress; therefore no offensive expedition of importance can be undertaken until after they shall have deliberated upon the subject and authorized such a measure.","The foolish and wicked practice of profane cursing and swearing is a vice so mean and low that every person of sense and character detests and despises it.","War - An act of violence whose object is to constrain the enemy, to accomplish our will.","A slender acquaintance with the world must convince every man that actions, not words, are the true criterion of the attachment of friends.","If we desire to avoid insult, we must be able to repel it; if we desire to secure peace, one of the most powerful instruments of our rising prosperity, it must be known, that we are at all times ready for War.","My observation is that whenever one person is found adequate to the discharge of a duty... it is worse executed by two persons, and scarcely done at all if three or more are employed therein.","Let your heart feel for the afflictions and distress of everyone, and let your hand give in proportion to your purse.","Over grown military establishments are under any form of government inauspicious to liberty, and are to be regarded as particularly hostile to republican liberty.","I walk on untrodden ground. There is scarcely any part of my conduct which may not hereafter be drawn into precedent.","I beg you be persuaded that no one would be more zealous than myself to establish effectual barriers against the horrors of spiritual tyranny, and every species of religious persecution.","It is impossible to reason without arriving at a Supreme Being.","Let your Discourse with Men of Business be Short and Comprehensive.","Lenience will operate with greater force, in some instances than rigor. It is therefore my first wish to have all of my conduct distinguished by it.","There can be no greater error than to expect, or calculate, upon real favors from nation to nation. It is an illusion which experience must cure, which a just pride ought to discard.","Nothing can be more hurtful to the service, than the neglect of discipline; for that discipline, more than numbers, gives one army the superiority over another.","Being no bigot myself to any mode of worship, I am disposed to endulge the professors of Christianity in the church, that road to heaven which to them shall seem the most direct plainest easiest and least liable to exception.","I am persuaded, you will permit me to observe, that the path of true piety is so plain as to require but little political direction.","Bad seed is a robbery of the worst kind: for your pocket-book not only suffers by it, but your preparations are lost and a season passes away unimproved."],"George Weah":["Education is a continual process, it's like a bicycle... If you don't pedal you don't go forward.","When I was growing up in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, I sold doughnuts, popcorn and Kool Aid every day after school so that my family had some money and I could pay my school fees. It was a tough life.","I don't want my title to define my character. I don't think, as a president, I will change.","Football has been good to me. Everyone has their destiny, but you have to make use of the opportunities. I have spent 15 years at the top of my game. It makes me happy. I love the game. I love scoring goals. But I have always taken it seriously. It is not what the game gives you, it is what you give it.","The United Nations should come in and take over Liberia, not temporarily, but for life. To make Liberians believe in democracy, to make us believe in human rights, they need to go in and just seize control of the country. That is the only way Liberia will ever become the kind of country it was supposed to be.","My fellow revolutionaries, liberation is a noble cause. We must fight to obtain it.","I am always successful in my work.","I can see in your eyes, I can see in your faces, I can see you cry. But what I want to say, there's no reason to cry. Do not, in the name of peace, go in the streets and riot.","I will go on my knees and ask the Liberian people to participate in bringing peace and stability to our country.","My government will be open. Anyone found guilty of corruption will be dealt with in accordance with the law. If you are corrupt you will have to hang your boots.","They say I do not have the qualifications to be president, that I do not have education. Well, I would never divide the Liberian people.","Around 80% of Liberians are unemployed and only half of all children go to primary school. Just one in 20 go on to secondary school. Young children are on the streets instead of in the classrooms. We are not giving them the opportunity to learn and they will struggle to get jobs when they grow up.","I believe education should be a right for every child, but tragically in many parts of world it is a privilege for certain children whose parents have money. There are 72 million children in the world who don't go to school and many of them are in Africa.","In America there is a public library in every community. How many public libraries are there in Africa? Every day there are new books coming out and new ideas being discussed. But these new books and ideas don't reach Africa and we are being left behind.","I know I have a successful career, a successful life. If I sit and say, 'Look, I have a comfortable life,' and I... just think about myself, I don't think that would be fair. That would be very selfish. Because everything I do in my life is to benefit my people.","If I say I am not a politician, it is because I did not go to school to do political science. But at the end of the day, I think we are all born politicians. It's practical. All you gotta do is practice.","Once you take care of people, people respect you.","I have proven to the world that I am articulate, I am very intelligent, I'm well exposed.","The whole thing about elections in Liberia - it's not about the way you take care of people, it's not about the heart, it's about education, according to the perception of some people.","My father died when I was young and I was raised by my grandmother, Emma Klonjlaleh Brown. We could afford to eat chicken just once a year, on Christmas.","I ask Liberians to pray so that God will bring peace and stability, and bring about unification to ourselves.","I am the elected president of Liberia, not Ellen Sirleaf. They stole my victory, and I am here to say loud and clear that I am the winner of the elections.","I want for us to be self-sustained so we can export. The government has a responsibility to have agricultural programs so people are able to grow their own food.","The roads for connectivity are vital. We have partners and we have revenue that we will make sure will come in to build our roads.","Of course I would have liked to have played at the World Cup, but I achieved so much in my career as a footballer that I can't have any complaints."],"George Weinberg":["I try not to deal with people's hostility, though I must if they have something I need from them, as the professors did at Columbia or my landlord did.","I didn't grow up with any concept of people being deviants unless they mistreated others.","Finally, fighting for gay rights, speaking out in various places and making friends, men and women, was great.","Men are actually the weaker sex.","Coming out to gays is a way of affirming sanity and self-worth.","I'm really not an avowed heterosexual. I'm no more proud of it than of being white or tall.","Hope never abandons you, you abandon it.","All love is original, no matter how many other people have loved before.","All who love are conspirators.","An essential idea is that if you give to some person or endeavor in life, you will make that more important.","And I've known people who came out with a sense of torture.","As I said, men value their independence in a weird way, above practically everything.","But the cure for most obstacles is, Be decisive.","Every man wants to feel that his woman would love him apart from anything else.","Homophobia is just that: a phobia.","I am very proud of being the one to have coined the word.","I felt like an apostle of the obvious and people imagined that I was doing something daring.","If every time you engage in a sex act, you go into a confession box, you will never accept your own sexuality.","Interestingly, the best way to promote intimacy is to demand it.","It wouldn't have mattered to my mother if I married a black, was gay, lived in a commune or wore a dress.","Many people secretly think that gays are a lot happier than they are, and want to punish them.","Men spend their whole lives showing that they're strong and silent. They fight for independence the way women struggle to connect.","My dearest friend in the movement is Jack Nichols. If there were no such thing as gay or straight, we would still talk and share experiences till the end of time.","My father was a pedant and a bully who cared about nobody, and I was not to see him until I was eighteen.","My father, who was from a wealthy family and highly educated, a lawyer, Yale and Columbia, walked out with the benefit of a healthy push from my mother, a seventh grade graduate, who took a typing course and got a secretarial job as fast as she could.","No man wants to feel that he's there because of his woman's biological clock or because he's filling a job opening for husband or significant other.","People have known of Shakespeare's homosexuality down through the ages.","The roots of homophobia are fear. Fear and more fear.","The world will step aside for nearly anyone who has the courage of his of her opinions.","There is no universal coming out process, so far as I know.","We are constantly creating ourselves by what we move toward or away from.","We each have a personal myth, a vision of who we really are and what we want. Health means that part of what you want is to give to others.","We have many cases of men committing suicide rather than face their own individuality. I know of no case of a woman who committed suicide because she was gay.","We're all here at the same time and we should celebrate that.","What worse illness can there be than acute conventionality. You should pray every night that you don't wake up with it.","You would be better off in exile than priding yourself on be like everyone else."],"George Wendt":["I really enjoy travel, I enjoy the U.K., I enjoy Scotland, Glasgow.","I not only get recognized - I get recognized from behind.","Honestly, I'm a shallow performer. I just go with the text and feel my way around it. There's not a whole lot of shaping.","Most of the holiday movies I enjoy, like 'It's a Wonderful Life,' don't really involve Santa.","I dream about 'Cheers.' Like when you go on a diet and you dream of pizza. I always think of those wonderful years. I loved working on it.","I like journalists.","I like New York.","Once in a while it can be a bit disconcerting to be so recognisable.","I get called to do a lot of labors of love... independent films on very small budgets. If I have the time and if the project speaks to me, it's better than sitting around, right?","I like to keep busy."],"George Whitefield":["Press forward. Do not stop, do not linger in your journey, but strive for the mark set before you.","It is a poor sermon that gives no offense; that neither makes the hearer displeased with himself nor with the preacher.","We are immortal until our work on earth is done.","Nothing is more generally known than our duties which belong to Christianity; and yet, how amazing is it, nothing is less practiced?","Mere heathen morality, and not Jesus Christ, is preached in most of our churches.","The righteousness of Jesus Christ is one of those great mysteries, which the angels desire to look into, and seems to be one of the first lessons that God taught men after the fall.","Various are the pleas and arguments which men of corrupt minds frequently urge against yielding obedience to the just and holy commands of God.","To preach more than half an hour, a man should be an angel himself or have angels for hearers.","Although believers by nature, are far from God, and children of wrath, even as others, yet it is amazing to think how nigh they are brought to him again by the blood of Jesus Christ.","But he is unworthy the name of a minister of the gospel of peace, who is unwilling, not only to have his name cast out as evil, but also to die for the truths of the Lord Jesus.","O that unbelievers would learn of faithful Abraham, and believe whatever is revealed from God, though they cannot fully comprehend it! Abraham knew God commanded him to offer up his son, and therefore believed, notwithstanding carnal reasoning might suggest may objections.","And now let me address all of you, high and low, rich and poor, one with another, to accept of mercy and grace while it is offered to you; Now is the accepted time, now is the day of salvation; and will you not accept it, now it is offered unto you?","As for the extraordinary operations of the Holy Ghost, such as working of miracles, or speaking with divers kinds of tongues, they are long since ceased.","When our Lord says, we must be converted and become as little children, I suppose he means also, that we must be sensible of our weakness, comparatively speaking, as a little child.","O my brethren, my heart is enlarge towards you. I trust I feel something of that hidden, but powerful presence of Christ, whilst I am preaching to you.","At the day of judgment we shall all meet again.","If your souls were not immortal, and you in danger of losing them, I would not thus speak unto you; but the love of your souls constrains me to speak: methinks this would constrain me to speak unto you forever.","Thus was the King and the Lord of glory judged by man's judgment, when manifest in flesh: far be it from any of his ministers to expect better treatment.","The great and important duty which is incumbent on Christians, is to guard against all appearance of evil; to watch against the first risings in the heart to evil; and to have a guard upon our actions, that they may not be sinful, or so much as seem to be so.","Among the many reasons assignable for the sad decay of true Christianity, perhaps the neglecting to assemble ourselves together, in religious societies, may not be one of the least.","For in Jesus Christ there is neither male nor female, bond nor free; even you may be the children of God, if you believe in Jesus.","Take care of your life and the Lord will take care of your death.","You see, my brethren, my heart is full; I could almost say it is too big to speak, and yet too big to be silent, without dropping a word to you.","The Judge is before the door: he that cometh will come, and will not tarry: his reward is with him.","Fight the good fight of faith, and God will give you spiritual mercies.","For it pleased God, after he had made all things by the word of his power, to create man after his own image.","This discourse, and the present frame of my mind, lead me rather to speak to those, who by feeling Satan's fiery darts, know assuredly that there is a devil.","It is very remarkable, that in the book of life, we find some almost of all kinds of occupations, who notwithstanding served God in their respective generations, and shone as so many lights in the world.","No, the religion of Jesus is a social religion.","The reason why the Son of God took upon him our nature, was, the fall of our first parents."],"George Will":["Baseball, it is said, is only a game. True. And the Grand Canyon is only a hole in Arizona. Not all holes, or games, are created equal.","Some calamities - the 1929 stock market crash, Pearl Harbor, 9/11 - have come like summer lightning, as bolts from the blue. The looming crisis of America's Ponzi entitlement structure is different. Driven by the demographics of an aging population, its causes, timing and scope are known.","Some parents say it is toy guns that make boys warlike. But give a boy a rubber duck and he will seize its neck like the butt of a pistol and shout 'Bang!'","If those who wrote and ratified the 14th Amendment had imagined laws restricting immigration - and had anticipated huge waves of illegal immigration - is it reasonable to presume they would have wanted to provide the reward of citizenship to the children of the violators of those laws? Surely not.","The pursuit of perfection often impedes improvement.","Big government inevitably drives an upward distribution of wealth to those whose wealth, confidence and sophistication enable them to manipulate government.","Traditionally, baseball punishes preening. In a society increasingly tolerant of exhibitionism, it is splendid when a hitter is knocked down because in his last at bat he lingered at the plate to admire his home run.","When liberals advocate a value-added tax, conservatives should respond: Taxing consumption has merits, so we will consider it - after the 16th Amendment is repealed.","Since the emergence of the Republican Party, only two Democratic presidents, Franklin Roosevelt and John Kennedy, have been followed by Democrats, and both FDR and JFK died in office, so their successors ran as incumbents.","As advertising blather becomes the nation's normal idiom, language becomes printed noise.","The designs of the paper euros, introduced in 2002, proclaim a utopian aspiration. Gone are the colorful bills of particular nations, featuring pictures of national heroes of statecraft, culture and the arts, pictures celebrating unique national narratives. With the euro, 16 nations have said goodbye to all that.","The nice part about being a pessimist is that you are constantly being either proven right or pleasantly surprised.","A society that thinks the choice between ways of living is just a choice between equally eligible 'lifestyles' turns universities into academic cafeterias offering junk food for the mind.","Perhaps the soundest advice for parents is: Lighten up. People have been raising children for approximately as long as there have been people.","Corporations do not pay taxes, they collect them, passing the burden to consumers as a cost of production. And corporate taxation is a feast of rent-seeking - a cornucopia of credits, exemptions and other subsidies conferred by the political class on favored, and grateful, corporations.","Voters don't decide issues, they decide who will decide issues.","America is the only developed nation that has a 2,000-mile border with a developing nation, and the government's refusal to control that border is why there are an estimated 460,000 illegal immigrants in Arizona and why the nation, sensibly insisting on first things first, resists 'comprehensive' immigration reform.","Political ignorance helps explain Americans' perpetual disappointment with politicians generally, and presidents especially, to whom voters unrealistically attribute abilities to control events.","Politicians fascinate because they constitute such a paradox; they are an elite that accomplishes mediocrity for the public good.","Well, you know, the definition of second marriage is the triumph of hope over experience.","Popularity makes no law invulnerable to invalidation. Americans accept judicial supervision of their democracy - judicial review of popular but possibly unconstitutional statutes - because they know that if the Constitution is truly to constitute the nation, it must trump some majority preferences.","Constitutional arguments that seem as dry as dust can have momentous consequences.","Government has the role of suiting people for freedom. People aren't made for freedom spontaneously. There's sort of a 19-year race between when people are born and when they become adults. And government has a role in making them, at the end of 19 years, suited to be upright, trustworthy repositories of popular sovereignty.","Big government is indeed big, and like another big creature, the sauropod dinosaur, government has a primitive nervous system: The fact of an injury to the tail could take nearly a minute to be communicated to the sauropod brain.","Modern parents want to nurture so skillfully that Mother Nature will gasp in admiration at the marvels their parenting produces from the soft clay of children.","Pessimism is as American as apple pie - frozen apple pie with a slice of processed cheese.","Just as the common law derives from ancient precedents - judges' decisions - rather than statutes, baseball's codes are the game's distilled mores. Their unchanged purpose is to show respect for opponents and the game. In baseball, as in the remainder of life, the most important rules are unwritten. But not unenforced.","World War II was the last government program that really worked.","A politician's words reveal less about what he thinks about his subject than what he thinks about his audience.","The future has a way of arriving unannounced.","In 1976, Jimmy Carter - peanut farmer; carried his own suitcase, imagine that - somewhat tapped America's durable but shallow reservoir of populism. By 1980, ordinariness in high office had lost its allure.","Conservatives define themselves in terms of what they oppose.","Childhood is frequently a solemn business for those inside it.","There may be more poetry than justice in poetic justice.","Today more Americans are imprisoned for drug offenses than for property crimes.","Football combines the two worst things about America: it is violence punctuated by committee meetings.","Being elected to Congress is regarded as being sent on a looting raid for one's friends.","If you seek Hamilton's monument, look around. You are living in it. We honor Jefferson, but live in Hamilton's country, a mighty industrial nation with a strong central government.","In the lexicon of the political class, the word 'sacrifice' means that the citizens are supposed to mail even more of their income to Washington so that the political class will not have to sacrifice the pleasure of spending it.","Leadership is, among other things, the ability to inflict pain and get away with it - short-term pain for long-term gain.","If your job is to leaven ordinary lives with elevating spectacle, be elevating or be gone.","Americans are overreaching; overreaching is the most admirable and most American of the many American excesses.","Politics should share one purpose with religion: the steady emancipation of the individual through the education of his passions.","Look, three love affairs in history, are Abelard and Eloise, Romeo and Juliet and the American media and this President at the moment. But this doesn't matter over time. Reality will impinge. If his programs work, he's fine. If it doesn't work, all of the adulation of journalists in the world won't matter.","All politicians are to some extent salesmen.","The strongest continuous thread in America's political tradition is skepticism about government.","I suppose there's a melancholy tone at the back of the American mind, a sense of something lost. And it's the lost world of Thomas Jefferson. It is the lost sense of innocence that we could live with a very minimal state, with a vast sense of space in which to work out freedom.","Freedom means the freedom to behave coarsely, basely, foolishly.","Voters cannot hold officials responsible if they do not know what government is doing, or which parts of government are doing what.","The average American expends more time becoming informed about choosing a car than choosing a candidate. But, then, the consequences of the former choice are immediate and discernible.","Committed partisans are generally the most knowledgeable voters, independents the least. And the more political knowledge people have, the more apt they are to discuss politics with people who agree with, and reinforce, them.","Obama, startled that components of government behave as interest groups, seems utterly unfamiliar with public choice theory. It demystifies and de-romanticizes politics by applying economic analysis - how incentives influence behavior - to government.","The euro currency both presupposes and promotes a fiction - that 'Europe' has somehow become, against the wishes of most Europeans, a political rather than a merely geographic expression.","The euro pleases dispirited people for whom European history is not Chartres and Shakespeare but the Holocaust and the Somme. The euro expresses cultural despair.","There is no 'European people' united by common mores.","Arizona's law makes what is already a federal offense - being in the country illegally - a state offense. Some critics seem not to understand Arizona's right to assert concurrent jurisdiction.","Arizonans should not be judged disdainfully and from a distance by people whose closest contacts with Hispanics are with fine men and women who trim their lawns and put plates in front of them at restaurants, not with illegal immigrants passing through their backyards at 3 A.M.","Believing that a crisis is a useful thing to create, the Obama administration - which understands that, for liberalism, worse is better - has deliberately aggravated the fiscal shambles that the Great Recession accelerated.","Money is time made tangible - the time invested in the earning of it. Taxation is the confiscation of the earner's time. Although some taxation is necessary, all taxation diminishes freedom.","The 1935 Social Security Act established 65 as the age of eligibility for payouts. But welfare state politics quickly becomes a bidding war, enriching the menu of benefits, so in 1956 Congress entitled women to collect benefits at 62, extending the entitlement to men in 1961.","Barack Obama hopes his famous health care victory will mark him as a transformative president. History, however, may judge it to have been his missed opportunity to be one.","Promoting dependency is the Democratic Party's vocation. It knows that almost all entitlements are forever, and those that are not - e.g., the lifetime eligibility for welfare, repealed in 1996 - are not for the middle class.","Democrats believe, plausibly, that middle-class entitlements are instantly addictive and, because there is no known detoxification, that class, when facing future choices between trimming entitlements or increasing taxes, will choose the latter.","Politics in a democracy is transactional: Politicians seek votes by promising to do things for voters, who seek promises in exchange for their votes.","Children who open their lunchboxes and find mothers' handwritten notes telling them how amazingly bright they are tend to falter when they encounter academic difficulties.","Only recently - about five minutes ago, relative to the long-running human comedy - have parents been driving themselves to distraction by taking too seriously the idea that 'as the twig is bent the tree's inclined.'","Sarah Palin, who with 17 months remaining in her single term as Alaska's governor quit the only serious office she has ever held, is obsessively discussed as a possible candidate in 2012. Why? She is not going to be president and will not be the Republican nominee unless the party wants to lose at least 44 states.","Populism has had as many incarnations as it has had provocations, but its constant ingredient has been resentment, and hence whininess. Populism does not wax in tranquil times; it is a cathartic response to serious problems. But it always wanes because it never seems serious as a solution.","Political nature abhors a vacuum, which is what often exists for a year or two in a party after it loses a presidential election.","I sometimes think that when he was at Harvard Law School, Mr. Obama cut class the day they got to the separation of powers, 'cause he seems to consider it not just an inconvenience but an indignity that, although he got 270 electoral votes and therefore gets to be president, he didn't get everything.","I've lived in Washington now for 44 years, and that's a lot of folly to witness up close. Whatever confidence and optimism I felt towards the central government when I got here on January 1, 1970 has pretty much dissipated at the hands of the government.","The first election I remember was Dewey Truman in '48. I was, I guess, seven years old.","I just got hooked on the radio, the voice of it all. It was my connection to metropolitan America, if you will. Sports, in particularly baseball then 'cause of its rich sediment of numbers, was one of the first things a young person could peg up with adults on - that is, you could know as much about Jimmy Fox as your father did.","In 2008, Barack Obama had all the wind at his back, everything going for him. He was an African-American at a time when the country was eager to do that. The Republicans had, in the view of many of us, pretty much disgraced themselves at home and abroad for eight years.","When I'm in my car, I'm listening to books, audio books, always.","Football is entertainment in which the audience is expected to delight in gladiatorial action that a growing portion of the audience knows may cause the players degenerative brain disease."],"George William Curtis":["A man's country is not a certain area of land, of mountains, rivers, and woods, but it is a principle and patriotism is loyalty to that principle.","It is not the ship so much as the skillful sailing that assures the prosperous voyage.","The new year begins in a snow-storm of white vows.","Books are the ever burning lamps of accumulated wisdom.","Nature makes woman to be won and men to win.","Our common liberty is consecrated by a common sorrow.","Romance like a ghost escapes touching; it is always where you are not, not where you are. The interview or conversation was prose at the time, but it is poetry in the memory.","Every great crisis of human history is a pass of Thermopylae, and there is always a Leonidas and his three hundred to die in it, if they can not conquer.","Reputation is favorable notoriety as distinguished from fame, which is permanent approval of great deeds and noble thoughts by the best intelligence of mankind.","The big mistake that men make is that when they turn thirteen or fourteen and all of a sudden they've reached puberty, they believe that they like women. Actually, you're just horny. It doesn't mean you like women any more at twenty-one than you did at ten.","It is not observed in history that families improve with time.","Happiness lies first of all in health.","While we read history we make history.","The test of civilization is its estimate of women.","Imagination is as good as many voyages - and how much cheaper!","Anger is an expensive luxury in which only men of certain income can indulge."],"George William Norris":["I think we ought to take the world as it is and not as we would like to have it.","Fourth, we might have declared an embargo against the shipping from American ports of any merchandise to either one of these governments that persisted in maintaining its military zone.","Men are often biased in their judgment on account of their sympathy and their interests.","And when it is done, we ought to follow the example by disarming ourselves.","During practically all of my public life, I have been a sincere advocate of an agreement between the leading nations of the world to set up all the necessary international machinery that would bring about a practical abolition of war between civilized nations.","First, we could have defied both of them and could have gone to war against both of these nations for this violation of international law and interference with our neutral rights.","Great wealth took possession of the government. It was reflected in Mr. Harding's selection of a cabinet.","I am bitterly opposed to my country entering the war, but if, notwithstanding my opposition, we do enter it, all of my energy and all of my power will be behind our flag in carrying it on to victory.","If the world is disarmed, and remains disarmed, there will be no more world wars.","In my judgment, if we had pursued this course, the zones would have been of short duration. England would have been compelled to take her mines out of the North Sea in order to get any supplies from our country.","No nation ought to keep a navy larger than is necessary to do police duty.","Teapot Dome involved the conservation of the oil resources of the United States, especially those situated upon the public lands.","The constitution ought to specifically state that every nation is left entirely independent and supreme in its internal affairs, such as regulating emigration and all other similar matters.","The first war zone was declared by Great Britain. She gave us and the world notice of it on the 4th day of November, 1914. The zone became effective Nov. 5, 1914.","The reason given by the President in asking Congress to declare war against Germany is that the German government has declared certain war zones, within which, by the use of submarines, she sinks, without notice, American ships and destroys American lives.","There is not much danger of the smaller nations if the big nations will behave.","Third, we could, while denouncing them both as illegal, have acquiesced in them both and thus remained neutral with both sides, although not agreeing with either as to the righteousness of their respective orders.","To my mind, what we ought to have maintained from the beginning was the strictest neutrality. If we had done this, I do not believe we would have been on the verge of war at the present time.","We ought to disarm Germany completely."],"George William Russell":["Love and hate have a magical transforming power. They are the great soul changers. We grow through their exercise into the likeness of what we contemplate.","Our hearts were drunk with a beauty Our eyes could never see.","Twilight, a timid, fawn, went glimmering by, and Night, the dark-blue hunter, followed fast.","The world can only be free when men are content in themselves and each draws from his own fountain.","When steam first began to pump and wheels go round at so many revolutions per minute, what are called business habits were intended to make the life of man run in harmony with the steam engine, and his movement rival the train in punctuality.","We may fight against what is wrong, but if we allow ourselves to hate, that is to insure our spiritual defeat and our likeness to what we hate.","Ah, to think how thin the veil that lies Between the pain of hell and Paradise.","I lay this down as a fundamental proposition, which I do not think will be denied, that whoever controls the taxation and trade policy of a country controls its destiny and the entire character of its civilization.","The victors in great wars have always been spiritually defeated by the conquered.","We have the universe to roam in in imagination. It is our virtue to be infinitely varied. The worst tyranny is uniformity.","By intensity of hatred, nations create in themselves the character that they imagine in their enemies. Hence it comes that all passionate conflicts result in an interchange of characteristics. We might say with truth, those who hate open a door by which their enemies enter and make their own the secret places of the heart.","You can't evoke great spirits and eat plums at the same time.","Any relations in a social order will endure, if there is infused into them some of that spirit of human sympathy which qualifies life for immortality.","After the spiritual powers, there is no thing in the world more unconquerable than the spirit of nationality. The spirit of nationality in Ireland will persist even though the mightiest of material powers be its neighbor.","Seek on earth what you have found in heaven.","Forgive me, Spirit of my spirit, for this, that I have found it easier to read the mystery told in tears and understood Thee better in sorrow than in joy.","The wind from the Kingdom of Heaven has blown all over the world, and shall blow for centuries yet.","The relation of landlord and tenant is not an ideal one, but any relations in a social order will endure if there is infused into them some of that spirit of human sympathy which qualifies life for immortality.","Nothing exasperates the spirit in man more than power which seems unconquerable and which makes impotent all protest.","We dwell in the house of the body, but its perfection and intricate life are the work of a wisdom which never relaxes dominion over a single cell.","We have control over the work of our hands, but little over the working of the soul. But yet we must yield to it, for without it we have nothing.","We realise that natural aptitudes are not interchangeable, and each person must, of biological or spiritual necessity, practise the art for which he is fitted.","It is true the orator may make a myriad replica of his own passion out of those who listen to him. But that does not prove he is right or they are not fools."],"George Woodcock":["I like to move among painters, mathematicians, psychologists, people who can tell me something.","I don't believe in kicking away ladders. By that, I mean the ladders by which I ascended as a young writer, small magazines that didn't pay anything, and that sort of thing.","I began even as a boy to realize how wide the world can be for a man of free intelligence.","You can be bound by physical things, as I am by certain sicknesses, but nevertheless you can still be free to recognize that all initiatives really come from yourself if you don't depend upon structures of government or structures of any kind.","It doesn't really mean a great deal of difference to a life. You live as you wish to do and if a job is oppressing, you leave it. I've done it on several occasions.","My split with the university was over the fact that I had become involved with helping Tibetans in India.","They decided that unpaid leave could only be granted through the decision of a council that consisted almost entirely of scientists who couldn't understand my reasons for wanting to go so. They said no, no unpaid. So I immediately resigned.","When you act dramatically in that way it often has a consequence that is very negative.","I was editing Canadian Literature. I didn't want to let Canadian Literature go, so they reached a nice compromise by which I received half a professor's salary.","I was allowed to wander where I could. Here is a case in which you search for your independence and allow something creative to come out of that.","It even has the same phraseology as the English orders of knighthood, companions and this sort of thing.","What I'm going to be given I gather is not the key to the city, which in many cities is the case. It's the freedom medal, and for me freedom has always been associated traditionally within the city.","Now I am a writer who can command fairly good payments from magazines with large circulations, I very often refuse to write for them and still write sometimes for small magazines for nothing.","My early wounds were the English school system among other things. It wasn't merely the discipline, it was the ways in which boys got what was called the school spirit.","I was unpopular at school just because I was an intellectual. I always answered all the questions off the top of my head but they nevertheless resented because of that.","I suppose I'm led to do so by the fact of what happened to my contemporaries - people whom I've admired, people who I thought were ten times better than me when I was in my twenties and early thirties. I may have been right.","Orwell was the sort of man who was full of grievances. He was very loyal. Once he got to know you, he was extremely loyal. He hated passionately and irrationally.","I believe in that connection between freedom and the city."],"George Zimmer":["I believe in giving people a second chance.","I never considered the clothing business in college. But my father was a manufacturer of men's wear in the Northeast and wanted to investigate manufacturing in Asia. In 1972 he sent me to Japan, Taiwan, and Hong Kong for four months. I'm convinced it was his way of getting me into business, rather than letting me be a hippie.","We rent one in three tuxedos in the U.S. and Canada, and if we make a mistake, our employees will deliver to the customer's home, office, or wedding. We get a couple hundred letters a week praising the service in our stores.","We opened the first Men's Wearhouse in Houston in August 1973, then a store a year for 10 years in Texas. In the early 1980s I opened a store in the San Francisco Bay Area. Within the year, the Texas economy was in total disarray. We were facing Chapter 11, and if not for the California store, we might not have survived.","In 1997, I was working with Greg Wilson of Red Ball Tiger, our ad agency at the time, when he came up with an addition to the famous slogan 'I guarantee it' that I was known for saying.","Instead of fostering the kind of dialogue in the boardroom that has in part contributed to our success, the board has inappropriately chosen to silence my concerns through termination as an executive officer."],"George Zimmerman":["Honestly, I want to live a calm life without being in the press. I want to be like any other American citizen who gets a speeding ticket or has an argument with his spouse... and doesn't have the whole world know.","I'd like to professionally... continue my education and hopefully become an attorney. I think that's the best way to stop the miscarriage of justice that happened to me from happening to somebody else. I don't think it should ever happen to anyone ever again - not one person.","I think that people assumed I was white because of my last name. My father is Caucasian, my mother is Hispanic. But English was my second language, believe it or not.","I recognize I have faults. I'm accountable for them, and I try to do what I can to correct them. I will say that it's unfortunate that everything I do is scrutinized to the point that it is. Frankly, I don't watch the news, I stay away from political conversations.","I'm not a racist, and I'm not a murderer."],"Georges Bataille":["Intellectual despair results in neither weakness nor dreams, but in violence. It is only a matter of knowing how to give vent to one's rage; whether one only wants to wander like madmen around prisons, or whether one wants to overturn them.","I believe that truth has only one face: that of a violent contradiction.","Life has always taken place in a tumult without apparent cohesion, but it only finds its grandeur and its reality in ecstasy and in ecstatic love.","Crime is a fact of the human species, a fact of that species alone, but it is above all the secret aspect, impenetrable and hidden. Crime hides, and by far the most terrifying things are those which elude us.","Eroticism is assenting to life even in death.","To place oneself in the position of God is painful: being God is equivalent to being tortured. For being God means that one is in harmony with all that is, including the worst. The existence of the worst evils is unimaginable unless God willed them.","A judgment about life has no meaning except the truth of the one who speaks last, and the mind is at ease only at the moment when everyone is shouting at once and no one can hear a thing.","Naturally, love's the most distant possibility.","The essence of morality is a questioning about morality; and the decisive move of human life is to use ceaselessly all light to look for the origin of the opposition between good and evil.","The anguish of the neurotic individual is the same as that of the saint. The neurotic, the saint are engaged in the same battle. Their blood flows from similar wounds. But the first one gasps and the other one gives.","Pleasure only starts once the worm has got into the fruit, to become delightful happiness must be tainted with poison.","Each of us is incomplete compared to someone else - an animal's incomplete compared to a person... and a person compared to God, who is complete only to be imaginary.","Sacrifice is nothing other than the production of sacred things.","The sovereign being is burdened with a servitude that crushes him, and the condition of free men is deliberate servility."],"Georges Bernanos":["Little things seem nothing, but they give peace, like those meadow flowers which individually seem odorless but all together perfume the air.","Hell, madam, is to love no longer.","No one ever discovers the depths of his own loneliness.","It's a fine thing to rise above pride, but you must have pride in order to do so.","Purity is not imposed upon us as though it were a kind of punishment, it is one of those mysterious but obvious conditions of that supernatural knowledge of ourselves in the Divine, which we speak of as faith. Impurity does not destroy this knowledge, it slays our need for it.","Faith is not a thing which one 'loses', we merely cease to shape our lives by it.","A poor man with nothing in his belly needs hope, illusion, more than bread.","The first sign of corruption in a society that is still alive is that the end justifies the means.","It is the perpetual dread of fear, the fear of fear, that shapes the face of a brave man.","The wish to pray is a prayer in itself. God can ask no more than that of us.","A thought which does not result in an action is nothing much, and an action which does not proceed from a thought is nothing at all.","Truth is meant to save you first, and the comfort comes afterward.","What does the truth matter? Haven't we mothers all given our sons a taste for lies, lies which from the cradle upwards lull them, reassure them, send them to sleep: lies as soft and warm as a breast!","The modern state no longer has anything but rights; it does not recognize duties any more.","Civilization exists precisely so that there may be no masses but rather men alert enough never to constitute masses.","Who are you to condemn another's sin? He who condemns sin becomes part of it, espouses it.","Hope is a risk that must be run."],"Georges Bizet":["As a musician I tell you that if you were to suppress adultery, fanaticism, crime, evil, the supernatural, there would no longer be the means for writing one note.","What a beautiful art, but what a wretched profession.","I want to do nothing chic, I want to have ideas before beginning a piece.","Religion is a means of exploitation employed by the strong against the weak; religion is a cloak of ambition, injustice and vice."],"Georges Braque":["There is only one valuable thing in art: the thing you cannot explain.","Art is made to disturb, science reassures.","Reality only reveals itself when it is illuminated by a ray of poetry.","To define a thing is to substitute the definition for the thing itself.","Once an object has been incorporated in a picture it accepts a new destiny.","Painting is a nail to which I fasten my ideas.","Truth exists; only lies are invented."],"Georges Carpentier":["Attack is only one half of the art of boxing.","Life is very interesting if you make mistakes."],"Georges Clemenceau":["It is far easier to make war than peace.","My home policy: I wage war; my foreign policy: I wage war. All the time I wage war.","A collective tyrant, spread over the length and breadth of the land, is no more acceptable than a single tyrant ensconced on his throne.","In order to act, you must be somewhat insane. A reasonably sensible man is satisfied with thinking.","I don't know whether war is an interlude during peace, or peace an interlude during war.","War is too serious a matter to entrust to military men.","All that I know I learned after I was thirty.","War is a series of catastrophes that results in a victory.","America is the only nation in history which miraculously has gone directly from barbarism to degeneration without the usual interval of civilization.","Begin to free yourself at once by doing all that is possible with the means you have, and as you proceed in this spirit the way will open for you to do more.","A man's life is interesting primarily when he has failed - I well know. For it's a sign that he tried to surpass himself.","A man who waits to believe in action before acting is anything you like, but he's not a man of action. You must act as you breathe."],"Georges Courteline":["It is better to waste one's youth than to do nothing with it at all.","If it was necessary to tolerate in other people everything that one permits oneself, life would be unbearable."],"Georges Cuvier":["Why has not anyone seen that fossils alone gave birth to a theory about the formation of the earth, that without them, no one would have ever dreamed that there were successive epochs in the formation of the globe.","The traces of upheavals become more impressive when one moves a little higher, when one gets even closer to the foot of the great mountain ranges. There are still plenty of shell layers. We notice them, even thicker and more solid ones.","My object will be, first, to show by what connections the history of the fossil bones of land animals is linked to the theory of the earth and why they have a particular importance in this respect.","But the revolutions and changes which are responsible for the present state of the earth are not limited to the upsetting of the ancient strata and to the ebbing of the sea after the formations of new layers.","It is evident that one cannot say anything demonstrable about the problem before having resolved these preliminary questions, and yet we hardly possess the necessary information to solve some of them.","The older the layers, the more each of them is uniform over a great extent; the newer the layers, the more they are limited and subject to variation within small distances.","Hence the same instant which killed the animals froze the country where they lived. This event was sudden, instantaneous, without any gradual development.","Thus it cannot be denied that the masses which today form our highest mountains were originally in a liquid state; for a long time they were covered by waters which did not sustain any life.","The lowest and most level land areas show us, especially when we dig there to very great depths, nothing but horizontal layers of material more or less varied, which almost all contain innumerable products of the sea.","The appearance of the bones of quadrupeds, especially those of complete bodies in the strata, tells us either that the layer itself which carries them was in earlier times dry land or that dry land was at least formed in the immediate area.","Secondly, the nature of the revolutions which have altered the surface of the earth must have had a more decisive effect on the terrestrial quadrupeds than on the marine animals.","Moreover, it thus follows that not a great deal of time was needed for the large animals of the three major parts of the world to become known to the people who spent time on the coasts of those regions."],"Georges Duhamel":["The swimmer adrift on the open seas measures his strength, and strives with all his muscles to keep himself afloat. But what is he to do when there is no land on the horizon, and none beyond it?","We do not know the true value of our moments until they have undergone the test of memory.","Do not trust your memory; it is a net full of holes; the most beautiful prizes slip through it.","I have too much respect for the idea of God to make it responsible for such an absurd world.","There is no French town in which the wounds inflicted on the battle-field are not bleeding.","In the beds which the piety of the public has prepared on every side, stricken men await the verdict of fate.","Suffering has roused them from the sleep of gentle life, and every day fills them with a terrible intoxication. They are now something more than themselves; those we loved were merely happy shadows.","Let us lose none of their humble words, let us note their slightest gestures, and tell me, tell me that we will think of them together, now and later, when we realise the misery of the times and the magnitude of their sacrifice.","We can know nothing till after this grave debate. The soul must withdraw, for this is not its hour. Now the knife must divide the flesh, and lay the ravage bare, and do its work completely.","It is always brave to say what everyone thinks."],"Georges Jacques Danton":["We must dare, and dare again, and go on daring.","Show my head to the people, it is worth seeing.","In order to conquer, what we need is to dare, still to dare, and always to dare.","At last I perceive that in revolutions the supreme power rests with the most abandoned.","The tocsin you hear today is not an alarm but an alert: it sounds the charge against our enemies.","Audacity, more audacity, always audacity.","In revolutions authority remains with the greatest scoundrels."],"Georges Pompidou":["There are three roads to ruin; women, gambling and technicians. The most pleasant is with women, the quickest is with gambling, but the surest is with technicians.","He imitated me so well that I couldn't stand myself any longer.","When I first arrived at the Matignon, my desire was to reconcile Parliament and De Gaulle. I had forgotten only two things. Parliament and De Gaulle.","The most dangerous thing about student riots is that adults take them seriously.","My fate is to be President of the Republic - or leader of the opposition."],"Georges Rouault":["For me, painting is a way to forget life. It is a cry in the night, a strangled laugh.","Nothing is old, nothing is new, save the light of grace underneath which beats a human heart. The way of feeling, of understanding, of loving; the way of seeing the country, the faces that your father saw, that your mother knew. The rest is chimerical.","A tree against the sky possesses the same interest, the same character, the same expression as the figure of a human.","The conscience of an artist worthy of the name is like an incurable disease which causes him endless torment but occasionally fills him with silent joy.","My only objective is to paint a Christ so moving that those who see him will be converted.","Subjective artists are one-eyed, but objective artists are blind.","I am a believer and a conformist.","Often pagans, with their eyes wide open, do not see very clearly.","The richness of the world, all artificial pleasures, have the taste of sickness and give off a smell of death in the face of certain spiritual possessions.","The artist discards all theories, both his own and those of others. He forgets everything when he is in front of his canvas."],"Georges Seurat":["Originality depends only on the character of the drawing and the vision peculiar to each artist.","Some say they see poetry in my paintings; I see only science."],"Georges Simenon":["The lake and the mountains have become my landscape, my real world.","I adore life but I don't fear death. I just prefer to die as late as possible.","I saw Mussolini tirelessly contemplate a parade of thousands of young men.","Writing is not a profession but a vocation of unhappiness.","Trotsky rises to give me his hand, then sits at his desk, gently allowing his regard to light on my person.","The fact that we are I don't know how many millions of people, yet communication, complete communication, is completely impossible between two of those people, is to me one of the biggest tragic themes in the world.","It was night and I could see a large and calm lake, reflecting the moon. Black mountains rose around it. I arrived from between two of these mountains, I looked at the lake and the moon, and that was it, nothing else happened.","I have always tried to write in a simple way, using down-to-earth and not abstract words.","It just happened. As though a moment comes when it's both necessary and natural to make a decision that has long since been made."],"Georges St-Pierre":["There is a difference between a fighter and a martial artist. A fighter is training for a purpose: He has a fight. I'm a martial artist. I don't train for a fight. I train for myself. I'm training all the time. My goal is perfection. But I will never reach perfection.","For me, personally, when I'm afraid of something - when you're afraid of something, normally you try to go away, you try to avoid it. Instead of avoiding it, to overcome your fear, I believe you need to embrace it.","I am a public person and I have my private life. It's important for me that my private life stay private, that what I share with the people is my public personality.","The more knowledge you get, the more questions you ask. The smarter you get, the more you realize that everything can be possible.","I was a big fan of Jean-Claude Van-Damme growing up, and I always wanted to be a martial artist 'cause of him.","I'm a martial artist, and I don't train because I have a fight; I train because it's my lifestyle, and I'll train every day if I'm not hurt.","I try to protect my loved ones, the people I share my life with, because they don't have a public life like me. I want to keep their lives private out of respect for them.","I am very honored and excited to be part of UFC 100; it's going to be the hardest challenge of my career so far and it's going to be pretty tough - I can't wait."],"Georgette Heyer":["I think myself I ought to be shot for writing such nonsense... But it's unquestionably good escapist literature, and I think I should rather like it if I were sitting in an air-raid shelter or recovering from flu.","Judging from the letters I've received from obviously feeble-minded persons who wish I would write another These Old Shades, it ought to sell like hot cakes.","She bowed her head, clasping her hands tightly before her upon the arm of his chair, for her heart yearned towards him, yet could not reach him, and it made her throat ache with unhappiness to meet that look of his that rested on her face without seeing it."],"Georgette Mosbacher":["Feminine force is that inner strength, that power, that will to face down any negative circumstances in life and defeat them.","Women must learn to find self-worth within themselves, not through others. It is important to carve out a place just for you.","I wasn't born a redhead, but I was born to be a redhead.","I grew up in a one-parent family. I worked my way through college, I had very average grades and I was very average looking, but I've lived a remarkable life only because I believed I could.","I stayed out of the sun when I was young, not because I knew better, but because I'm a Type A personality who gets too restless to lay around and do nothing.","Unless you have financial resources of your own, you can't be free.","If I were old, fat and ugly, I don't know if anybody would be interested in me.","I wouldn't change myself, even if I could. I like myself. And the minute you're not true to yourself, you're in trouble.","I have serious adult acne, am almost legally blind and have to work at controlling my weight."],"Georgi Parvanov":["I believe that the capital of the Republic of Albania is a suitable venue for discussing the dialogue among religions and civilizations, notably in the countries of South East Europe, because we are well familiar with this country's track record of religious tolerance.","We are aware that in 2005 our efforts to preserve the stability and prestige of the Republic of Bulgaria in the area of foreign policy, and our efforts to attain fully our strategic goals will be mostly contingent upon the way we address our domestic priorities.","A two-speed Europe will not be a strong Europe. The idea of making decisions and policies in a narrow circle, disregarding smaller EU members, will make it hard to engage them to commit to a common policy, which will weaken the union.","I will work for Bulgaria's strategic choice - Bulgaria's membership in the European Union and NATO. I think it is also extremely important to revive Bulgaria's relations with Russia, Ukraine and other strategic partners.","I will be a president of all Bulgarians, irrespective of their ethnicity, religion or political affiliations."],"Georgia Groome":["I started out in theatre, and there's no better feeling than the adrenaline of being on stage.","I was out with my mum when a man started screaming at me: 'Georgia Groome. I love you.' Mum and I just looked at each other for a split second - and then ran away as fast as we could.","You are what you are, and I'd rather be myself than try and be what I'm not.","I can't drive, so I don't need a flash car, and I like living at home, so I don't need a mansion. I'm sensible with money. It's not why I act.","Honestly, I was only rested in rugby football; all my friends were boys, and I definitely didn't want to go on stage, but I just did it to keep everyone happy. I did some singing, dancing like they liked, but it wasn't my thing at all.","I need good grades because I want to go on to do A-Levels. I'm just not sure yet about whether I will go to university, because I really want to see what happens with the acting.","'Tusk Tusk' is about a family of kids who are alone, the audience don't know why.","Playing Joanne in 'London to Brighton' was my first taste of film, and I loved every second of it.","I want to try everything I can; I want to push my boundaries and experiment with characters and genres that I have yet to try."],"Georgia Holt":["There's a lot of things that you can do where you don't have to have a lot of money. Going to the drive-in, which cost a dollar, and we would make food to take with us to the drive-in. That was a big thrill.","My mother was 13 when I was born. My childhood was pretty frantic, to say the least. My mother left when I was about 5, and Daddy started me singing in clubs. Then I started singing on the radio in Oklahoma City when I was 7.","I started singing on the radio in Los Angeles. I sang blues, but I would tend toward country blues.","I went to work in a woman's home in Los Angeles as a mother's helper. I worked there about two years. Went to school with all rich kids. I was the only poor kid in the school, and I was already insecure. But my voice saved me because I sang in school, and I was real popular because of my voice.","It has been tough being a mother of two daughters without a co-parent because I think I was a child myself, as my mother was.","I was married a lot, but I didn't stay married very long because I didn't seem to be able to choose somebody that was a stable man.","Cybill Shepherd's mother - her name is Patty - is a good friend of mine.","There's a certain amount of pain and heartache that goes with being the mother of a star and that all the mothers experience. It's not being with them as much as you like.","I've always had real good taste; no matter how poor I've been, I've had good taste in clothes.","People that I have known that have been extremely creative, people in the business, they have always been influenced by their mothers. Their mothers are the ones that created whatever it is - the urge to create."],"Georgia Jagger":["My dad's supportive of all my endeavors.","I think music influences fashion and has done so for generations.","Fake tan is really difficult to get right. When I was younger, I'd always do it wrong. I'd leave it on and forget to wash it off. So I embrace being pale. I like getting a tan, but I also think that if you're going to do it, it has to be gradual. I just work the pale thing now.","Who wants those gleaming white cosmetically enhanced American teeth?","When I was about 12 and first started wearing lipstick, my dad would ask, 'Are you wearing makeup?' I would say back, 'You're wearing more makeup there than I am!'","Modeling is always something I've really admired because I've seen my mum and sister do it.","I think all the stuff that happens before the pictures are taken is much more exciting.","Music creates a certain mood and then people dress accordingly. I think it's all quite closely intertwined.","My mum is actually really wholesome.","Even when my parents were together, they both had to travel and work, and it wasn't like they had nine-to-five jobs. In that way, it wasn't a normal family life.","My dad's not a very intimidating father figure.","I'm quite dyslexic in school.","I wouldn't even have braces on my teeth. I think they are horrible and this idea that everyone should conform and be perfect is ridiculous.","I want to be an entrepreneur too; I like the business side of things. When I was younger I wanted to be a vet or a tightrope walker. But I have no sense of balance and I can't bear animals dying, so I abandoned both ideas.","Reality TV rots people's brains.","I used to have a pony but I outgrew it and I do dream that one day I will live in the country and have lots of horses and be like a proper English lady who goes hunting and everything.","My parents never really lecture me.","My dad let me figure out what I wanted to do on my own.","My dad has more sparkly stuff than most men.","I still think of my mum as being kind of a dork - a cooler one, but still a dork.","I like the fact that I have good old-fashioned British teeth with a big gap.","I like to do a face steam, so, heat up a flannel, press it onto your face and then press a cold one on afterwards to close the pores. It's inexpensive!","I have to exfoliate my lips as they're quite a large surface area and sometimes when I wear lipstick, it goes all cakey. So I mix brown sugar with lip balm and just scrub it onto them.","I do have bad hair days. If I fall asleep with it slightly damp, I wake up and it'll all be piled up on top in a mess.","I really never thought about the way I looked until boys came into the picture.","I think when your parents are as rebellious as mine were, it's difficult to top them. So what's the point?","I didn't want to miss out on my education to model. I can't do just modeling.","My problem is that I always find jeans that are either high-waisted or low-rise, but nothing in between, like they used to be in the eighties and early nineties. That's actually the most flattering cut."],"Georgia King":["Skydiving is special because it's almost the closest to an out-of-body experience you can have. We live in such a stimulated, connected, busy world - to be up in the air with nothing but yourself and the landscape is incredibly peaceful.","We're often blinded by romance; we decide to not see things we don't want to see, and put up with behavior that we shouldn't put up with.","I pretended to be super-cool and not be bothered by things and play off any kind of heartache when I was younger, for sure.","When I say that I'm a grade-A student in motocross, I mean that I can sit on a bike and ride it. But I'm confident that, with time, I could do a 12 o'clock.","My dad discouraged me and my older sister watching too much TV. I don't want to portray them as crazy hippies, but I definitely feel like I was influenced by their creativity. But did I want to have an acting career myself? I didn't think so. I think my goal really was to direct. I really wanted to make stories in that capacity.","I grew up in the countryside, in literally the middle of nowhere. We had one neighbor and a lot of sheep.","My dad was in these pretty big films that were relevant to my age group. I remember him doing 'Richie Rich' when I was eight-years-old, and then 'Jumanji.' I remember going to these sets, and I loved being on film sets. I just found it fascinating watching how stories were made.","Fame is a weird thing. I think maybe I learned to never get too big for your boots. Keep your feet on the ground and keep your head down and work hard - that's probably what I learned from my parents more than anything. Remain generous and kind, and have humility.","I'm a massive sports fan and have a lot of energy, so I'm always running around doing crazy amounts of exercise.","I grew up on Jane Austen novels and was a massive literature fanatic when I was a kid - I read everything I could get my hands on.","If I need to take a break from work, I'll just Google dogs that are up for adoption in L.A. I really want a poodle mix, and I want to name her Rita. That's my dream, and one day it's going to happen.","I've already bungee jumped, so I am thinking about diving with sharks. I watched a little snippet of 'Jaws 2,' and I was like, 'Nope! I'll save it for a rainy day.' Unfortunately, I live in England, and it's always raining.","I do, I love to mock stuff. I am a British person."],"Georgia May Jagger":["I really like doing portraits, but I like taking pictures of things that are natural, like scenery, too.","My dad was fine about me doing modelling at 16 because I always said school was important to me. I always chose my jobs carefully so I wouldn't have to take too much time off. It got harder toward the end with my A-levels; there were sleepless nights, and I was doing my homework on the plane coming home, but I pulled through.","I preferred MTV as it used to be when it was about the music - I don't like it that now they just have reality shows. Reality TV rots people's brains.","I eat three meals a day and three juices a day.","Just Cavalli for Her is a flowery and sexy fragrance. I like its freshness and feminine scent.","Cavalli is all about being a strong woman - being sexy and powerful. Which is how we'd like to feel, all of the time! The clothes are very strong and sexy - quite Amazonian. And you feel like that yourself when you're wearing the clothes.","Round, cat-eye frames, wayfarers, and aviators are my go-tos.","When you're young, no one cares who your parents are, although Mum would arrive to pick me up in her full hair and make-up and fur, and I used to say, 'Can't you just dress normally, like all the other mums?' I wanted her to blend in more, but I've always been really proud of Mum - as proud as she is of me.","I think if everyone looked the same, it would be a bit boring.","Material Girl is about having your own personal style, and my personal style reflects the brand's aesthetic.","My mum is actually really wholesome.","Even when my parents were together, they both had to travel and work, and it wasn't like they had nine-to-five jobs. In that way, it wasn't a normal family life. We'd go and stay for a few weeks with Dad on tour and bring a tutor with us.","I'm quite dyslexic in school. My dad let me figure out what I wanted to do on my own. My parents never really lecture me.","I model jeans. You need a bum for those.","I really never thought about the way I looked until boys came into the picture. Then it starts to be like, 'Am I wearing the right outfit? I have to do my makeup for school!'","I always see those jeans with the stretchy front on pregnant women, and they look like the dreamiest thing ever.","My problem is that I always find jeans that are either high-waisted or low-rise, but nothing in between, like they used to be in the eighties and early nineties. That's actually the most flattering cut.","I'm very interested in music, but I was not born musical. I honestly do think some people have the knack. I can't play an instrument. I'm a terrible singer. I'm not about to launch my album!","I'm interested in every aspect of fashion. I think it's in my bones. When I was younger I used to be my mum's stylist, picking things out for her to wear. I'd say to her, 'If anybody asks you who styled you tonight say, 'Georgia.'","I wouldn't even have braces on my teeth. I think they are horrible, and this idea that everyone should conform and be perfect is ridiculous. I like the fact I have good old-fashioned British teeth with a big gap. Who wants those gleaming white cosmetically enhanced American teeth?","When I was younger, I wanted to be a vet or a tightrope walker. But I have no sense of balance, and I can't bear animals dying, so I abandoned both ideas.","We have a snap of my dad wearing blue eye shadow, which I would always make fun of. When I was about 12 and first started wearing lipstick, my dad would ask, 'Are you wearing makeup?' I would say back, 'You're wearing more makeup there than I am!'","When I went on tour with my father, I knew he was a musician. But they were my parents. I still think of my mum as being kind of a dork - a cooler one, but still a dork.","I think my gap adds character. A while ago, on the street, a guy yelled, 'You could stick a gold through your front teeth!' Which meant I could put a £1 coin between them. But you can't. I've tried! Fifty-pence coins and 2-pence coins, yes. But not a pound.","I really like Tracie Martyn beauty products for skin care. Take off your makeup before you go to sleep. Sometimes I forget, and it is always horrible when you wake up.","I wear high heels for long legs.","I have a coconut oil stick, which I use for everything - on my eye lids to make them shinier, on my lips, and on any dry skin.","I actually really love the Kate Moss Rimmel lipsticks. Sometimes I get afraid of different colours. I want to try a bright pink, but I don't want to look tacky!","Basically, my hair is very dry from all the backcombing! Hairdressers prefer if your hair is dry and damaged, as it makes it easier to style.","My Mum always says to have fun; remember that fashion is about fun, and that is the most important thing because sometimes, people take it very seriously. Great advice to remember!","I would love to do my own line of clothes - something small.","I love to shop vintage clothes; in London, I usually go to Relic and Alfie's Market. I usually brunch around London Bridge, where I live.","My mum taught me a lot about fashion in terms of knowing what looks good on you and developing my own sense of style. Even when we were shooting the Sunglass Hut campaign, we went through racks of clothing together, and ultimately I decided on a short, more fitted peplum dress, while Mum opted for a sexy blazer and black leggings.","My friends call me 'George,' 'GM,' or 'Georgia.' But most people who know me from when I was little call me 'Georgia May.'","I would like to do all kinds of things: photography and art and designing; I want to help do charity things for animals and things like that.","I'm like a middle-aged person; when my friends go on about modern bands, I don't know what they are talking about. I'm into rock n' roll, like Jimi Hendrix. Not so much because of my parents, who used to play a lot of Nina Simone and older blues, but my brother and sister.","Fashion is about fun, you know, and I think a lot of people forget that sometimes.","Drink lots of water, get lots of sleep, and take vitamin C!","I am not about fringing, cow girl boots, that kind of Coachella vibe. I just wear something comfortable.","Roberto Cavalli is a great designer. The Just Cavalli brand is very sexy, young and cool. Each collection is very contemporary and colourful; it is clearly for the younger generation who wants to have a trendy look. It's the first fragrance that I have ever done, so it's a huge honour!","I'd love to do a fashion label in the future. I've been thinking a lot recently about maybe making a line of little dresses, so maybe one day.","My collection has a whole new cut; they are based on the style of jeans my mum wore in Texas in the '70s."],"Georgia O'Keeffe":["When you take a flower in your hand and really look at it, it's your world for the moment. I want to give that world to someone else. Most people in the city rush around so, they have no time to look at a flower. I want them to see it whether they want to or not.","I decided that if I could paint that flower in a huge scale, you could not ignore its beauty.","I found I could say things with color and shapes that I couldn't say any other way - things I had no words for.","Nobody sees a flower really; it is so small. We haven't time, and to see takes time - like to have a friend takes time.","I've been absolutely terrified every moment of my life - and I've never let it keep me from doing a single thing I wanted to do.","To create one's world in any of the arts takes courage.","One can't paint New York as it is, but rather as it is felt.","You get whatever accomplishment you are willing to declare.","I decided to start anew, to strip away what I had been taught.","I often lay on that bench looking up into the tree, past the trunk and up into the branches. It was particularly fine at night with the stars above the tree.","It was in the 1920s, when nobody had time to reflect, that I saw a still-life painting with a flower that was perfectly exquisite, but so small you really could not appreciate it.","I feel there is something unexplored about woman that only a woman can explore.","I had to create an equivalent for what I felt about what I was looking at - not copy it.","I hate flowers - I paint them because they're cheaper than models and they don't move.","Sun-bleached bones were most wonderful against the blue - that blue that will always be there as it is now after all man's destruction is finished.","Singing has always seemed to me the most perfect means of expression. It is so spontaneous. And after singing, I think the violin. Since I cannot sing, I paint.","I said to myself, I have things in my head that are not like what anyone has taught me - shapes and ideas so near to me - so natural to my way of being and thinking that it hasn't occurred to me to put them down.","I have things in my head that are not like what anyone has taught me - shapes and ideas so near to me - so natural to my way of being and thinking that it hasn't occurred to me to put them down.","One can not be an American by going about saying that one is an American. It is necessary to feel America, like America, love America and then work.","Anyone who doesn't feel the crosses simply doesn't get that country.","I know now that most people are so closely concerned with themselves that they are not aware of their own individuality, I can see myself, and it has helped me to say what I want to say in paint.","It was all so far away - there was quiet and an untouched feel to the country and I could work as I pleased.","The days you work are the best days.","I don't very much enjoy looking at paintings in general. I know too much about them. I take them apart.","Marks on paper are free - free speech - press - pictures all go together I suppose.","I believe I would rather have Stieglitz like something - anything I had done - than anyone else I know.","I often painted fragments of things because it seemed to make my statement as well as or better than the whole could."],"Georgia Salpa":["When I'm in a bikini or at a photo shoot, I'm real confident. But, if I'm in a group of people I don't know, I'm really quiet.","My worst habit is probably that I'm extremely messy. I'm a big scatter-brain - I'm always losing my car keys, or worse, forgetting where I parked my car in the car park.","My top beauty tip is to drink lots of water. It might sound lame, but it works.","It's very hard when you do photocalls. You have to be on time, you have to be all cheesy smiles, and have your hair and make-up done, and be into it. It's not like a photoshoot. You have to really put the cheese factor in. I think you have to be more willing to go for it.","I will always do what I want to do and I won't go with the crowd.","In Ireland, I don't get asked out much. English boys are a lot more flirty.","I like Megan Fox; I think she's really hot, too.","I'm the kind of girl who always has a boyfriend.","I like guys who wear nice clothes, nice jeans, nice trainers - I hate skinny jeans and those T-shirts that are really low-cut.","You always get one or two people that aren't going to be saying nice things. It doesn't really bother me, but you're always going to get a few people like that.","Guys always attract my attention when they wear nice clothes and they make an effort.","I think it shows that you are a confident person if you can walk up to a group of girls and just be able to talk to them sober.","I don't know if I'd wanna be in the limelight.","When I do club appearances, it's girls who come up and get their photos taken with me, not just guys.","In the future, I want to have children.","When I left school, I went backpacking around the world for two years.","If I wasn't modelling, I guess I would work in fashion as a buyer.","I have fun. I don't take myself too seriously.","I've never hung around with any models. I've always hung around with my friends from school and kept myself to myself.","I used to have really bad skin, and when I was younger, I had a lazy eye. I had to wear a patch and pink-rimmed glasses.","I think Katie Price is a really good businesswoman. She has made so much money.","I don't do 'Image' magazine or high-fashion shows.","You won't really see me at any events, any nightclubs."],"Georgie Fame":["If you had a good radio - and everybody did in those days - you could find it.","Suckle was the first West Indian DJ and he had this fantastic source of music.","The BBC were not playing the music that was happening on the street so we did an independent production because we knew we had an audience. Then we licensed the album to EMI.","We were at Pye Studios for half an hour so we set the gear up and we did two tracks. A month later we found out it was selling thirty thousand copies a day.","I broke up the band in the office in Gerrard Street.","Some people think I'm a rock 'n' roll musician and some think I'm a jazz musician but, for me, there is no difference.","In my youth I thought I was going to be a professional rugby player.","My generation had the best years. We missed the Second World War and caught the outburst of rock 'n' roll.","I avoid the media circus, keep my head down and try to keep growing and learning things."],"Georgie Henley":["Cheese and jam are really nice. Cheese and apple as well. Cheese and grapes are good.","My mother treats me exactly the same as she has always done, and the same as my older sisters. She tells me off when I need it, and sometimes I do need telling to go to my room or to do my homework.","I am definitely not into the exposed look. I am not one of those people who flashes their stomach or anything like that, because I don't have the confidence.","I have confidence in my personality, because I think that if I talk to people hopefully they will like me, but I don't have confidence in my body.","I like individuality in fashion - it annoys me when celebrities put on a bodycon dress and a pair of high heels and suddenly they are 'style icons.'","I really love school, but I'd love to continue acting jobs if I can.","I'll watch anything as long as it's good. I can't choose just one movie that I love.","Filming is a very adult world, and you need to be with people your own age.","I really look up to people who experiment in all areas and I think Johnny Depp is a really good actor to look up to because he's done so many genres of films."],"Georgina Bloomberg":["For me, being a part of the ASPCA is a great way to tie in my love for animals and my love for New York City. Whether it's fighting puppy mills or working with the NYPD to prosecute people who abuse animals or breaking up fight rings, it's an incredible part of my city life.","If people were able to afford to eat nutritious food, I think they would make better choices.","My father told me when I went to college that I needed to take an accounting class. I enrolled and went the first day. I didn't understand a thing that was being said and dropped the class. I really regret that decision. I should have stuck it out and learned the basics of accounting, but I took the easy way out.","I don't believe in New Year's resolutions. I think if you want to change something, change it today and don't wait until the New Year.","I love slippers, but I have five dogs. So unfortunately, I have a lot of single slippers.","We have always had dogs, so I've never known a time in my life where haven't had a dog. And it is so nice to have something there that is always happy to see you, can always give you love, and is unconditionally loyal. I have always enjoyed having something to take care of, and it prepared me for motherhood.","Marriage is not super-important to me - most end in divorce. I love the idea of being with someone forever, but I don't think it happens very often.","Marriage was coined at a time when people died when they were 30. That stability would be nice, and I am definitely open-minded about it, but I don't need it in that way some women do.","I'm not traditional at all. It's not that I'm against marriage; it just never mattered that much to me. If I was dating someone who getting married was very important to them, then absolutely. I'd have no problem. I love the idea of finding someone to be a great father figure to Jasper and to share my life with.","When I was a teenager I hated having Bloomberg as a last name and being seen simply as someone's daughter. I used to shy away from it in every way. As I got older, I began to realize that it was something I could use to make a difference in the causes I cared about. I learned to be proud of my last name.","Ivanka Trump is a close friend and just a wonderful person, mother, and businesswoman. Everyone thinks she has it all, but she always stresses that there is no such thing.","I had to take a big risk by writing my young adult book series 'The A Circuit' and putting myself out there in that way. I don't consider myself a good writer, so I had to rely on a co-writer. Still, I knew that people would judge me and my writing. I am really proud of the way the series turned out.","If I couldn't compete, I wouldn't ride. I don't ride for fun; I ride to prepare for the next competition, and everything that I do when I am in the saddle is always a calculated step in my path to the next win.","Dogs and their well-being is one of my biggest passions in life. The Michael Vick case brought the issue of dogfighting to light... he knew what he was doing and never deserved to play in the NFL again.","As a mother, I'm constantly feeling like a failure.","George Morris is a legend. I was lucky enough to have been on a number of his U.S. show-jumping teams and am constantly trying to learn from him.","Dahl was my favorite author as a child. When I got older, I discovered his adult stories and fell even more in love with him.","Voting for a politician is very different then saying you like somebody or don't like somebody.","I think anyone who has a boy would tell you that they do the sort of things that make you look at them and ask why they would do that. 'Oh right, because you're a boy.'","I like the idea of teaching kids how to lose. That's a really important lesson in life. I don't like the idea of doing leadline where everyone gets a blue ribbon. I think it's unrealistic for kids and teaches the wrong lesson.","I never spend money on hair bands. I just go to a ribbon-trimming store.","I never understood girls who give away jewelry just because it came from an ex. I consider it compensation.","Carrie Bradshaw made it okay for New York women to take fashion chances and show that they are fabulous and strong.","I only really cook for myself once or twice a week, but I cook for my dogs almost every day.","I stretch while I am brushing my teeth to save time, and my son likes to join in and thinks it's hilarious.","I try to tell myself something encouraging to get myself pumped for the day.","I read the 'New York Post' every day. It keeps me connected to my home town even when I am on the road.","I don't travel without a sleep mask or Post Its!","When I was growing up, I got a lot of, 'Oh, well, she bought the nicest horse, so of course she's going to win.' And I dealt with a lot of that.","Having the last name 'Bloomberg' sucks.","My mother grew up around horses and exposed my sister and I to riding early on. It was very important to her.","I'm a high-strung personality, and I love checking off my to-do list - it's my way of relaxing. I also genuinely love working out. If I have an hour to kill, I love to go to the gym. It's a stress-release for me.","I work out almost every day with some form of cardio, a few times a week, laps in the pool, weight training and Pilates.","The thrill of pushing limits and breaking the rules is in our blood. But we New Yorkers have a secret that we don't want the rest of the world knowing... We love our dogs.","I want kids: two adopted and three of my own.","I am all into doing things that will be cool stories to tell my grandkids.","I've always put my horses, dogs, and pig before my own needs, so I was well prepared to put my son first. I'm used to waking up in the middle of the night... no matter how tired I am, jumping up to take care of my animals. Now, I do the same for my son.","Having the name 'Bloomberg' doesn't help me in any way... and it really is a disadvantage and takes away from the image I'm trying to portray.","I really like to look professional but also have personal flare. You will never find me in head-to-toe designer - I like to mix it up.","I could live in Target clothes forever."],"Georgina Campbell":["I've not been discriminated against, but I can see it happen. And not just race but gender and sexuality, too. It's stereotyping, lazy casting, which is an issue: that people can't see outside the box.","Within the media, the way that women are portrayed - especially young women - sometimes there is a lot of sexual objectification and, I would say, 'lad culture.' These are all things that connect with domestic abuse.","It's a shame that ethnic minorities aren't getting a crack at different types of roles. There needs to be a bit of a change.","We've always had a sadistic obsession with technology.","When you're an actor, people just take it for granted that you're really confident and can get up in front a stage full of people and just speak to them.","I've always really liked murder mysteries and thrillers, and great to be able to be actually part of one.","Anything in which you're playing someone real does make you feel responsible for making the story as true as it can be.","America seems much more diverse and has more exciting casting - they really take risks.","I certainly didn't have an exciting or a crazy childhood.","People who are in abusive relationships often don't realise it, but it slowly seems to build until you're trapped.","You just never see people of different ethnicities in period dramas.","My mum records everything I'm in on VHS. Like, who still has VHS? I told her it's all online now, but she still tapes it.","I was 16 and standing on Tottenham Court Road when this woman came over and asked me if I was an actress. She wanted me to audition for an online drama she was directing. I had time to kill, so I thought, 'Why not?'","I'm definitely not that fashion forward.","Sometimes, with portrayals of domestic violence, the women involved are just victims with no personality, just completely trodden-down. But people continue to live their normal lives: they go out; they continue to have arguments with their partners, even if there is always the fear of where that might end up.","I'm not really into destiny, but it's funny - I bumped into a woman who told me about an audition, and now I have a BAFTA.","I have used dating apps a couple of times in the past and met people, but it is a difficult thing because you're meeting someone who you really don't know and you have no link to. I have friends who have had great relationships after meeting on Tinder or Bumble, so I'd never say never, but it hasn't worked for me.","I'm ambivalent about tech.","A childhood favourite that has stayed with me over the years is Kate Winslet. She's an amazing British actress who always delivers no matter what role she's in. Another actress I've found incredibly inspiring is Olivia Colman.","I do think that being a BAME actor does make it difficult to avoid stereotypes.","I think people in the U.K. should be concerned about the under-representation of BAME actors in TV and Film, because it is an incorrect reflection of our society.","I would love to say something really cool, because I did film studies. So, like, a Jean-Luc Goddard film - something like that. But I genuinely would love to be in 'Titanic.' I'm such a loser. That's, like, my childhood film. Like, I love it.","Really good leading roles are few and far between, and there is so much competition because there are so many fantastic actresses in this country.","I wanted to be an air hostess because I thought it was the most glamorous thing - and I'd never been on a plane.","It's so hard to get into this industry. There are so many people who are so talented, and they never get those opportunities.","I think there's always a way to bring something, even if it is just the girlfriend role, as long as you're playing it with an idea of who that person is on their own, away from the male character.","The narrative of, 'You won an award, so you're going to skyrocket' - it's very emotive language but not necessarily true. I've definitely got auditions I wouldn't have got before, but it's not like jobs get rained down on you.","I'd like to work at the Royal Court Theatre, please.","If you read the script, and the character's got something in it that you relate to, then I am keen. But I really think, a lot of the time, my successful auditions are those where I really care about the characters.","I don't know if I ever really think about being a role model. But I guess if you're in the public eye and people are looking at what you do, you do want to be a good role model, and you want to kind of be seen in a good light.","Awards do get you 'that profile,' but then you have to do the rest of the work - it's not just a case of 'now you don't have to do anything.'","It happens a lot that women have to play the girlfriend role, which isn't as three-dimensional as the male role.","So many fantastic male characters are brooding, angry, and not nice; that doesn't happen as much with women.","I watch everything with Olivia Colman in.","I've always wanted to do a horror film. I don't know if my agent will be happy I said that when I get sent some crap horror films, but I'd like to do a good one, like 'It Follows,' or 'The Babadook.'"],"Georgina Chapman":["I'm actually an incredibly disorganized, messy person.","Bridesmaids are never going to upstage the bride.","One of my most sentimental items is my grandmother's engagement ring that my mom gave me a few years ago. It's a Victorian-style setting that's closed in the back, so it doesn't sparkle the way diamonds do now. I wear it as a pendant.","Belize suits me because I'm active and I like diving. I learnt when I was 18, in Thailand, and I have dived in Vietnam, which wasn't great, the Red Sea, which was incredible and reasonably priced, and then the Maldives, which is like being submerged in an aquarium.","Photography obviously lends itself so well towards fashion. It's capturing that moment and that inspiration, and as a designer you are constantly walking through the world assimilating those visual references you have and so being able to solidify that into a photograph and keep it on your mood board is essential to creating a collection.","My great-grandfather was in the army in India, and we have photographs of my family there in full Victorian dress. They're incredibly romantic.","I went camping in the Maasai Mara and we moved site every night. I had no idea how spectacular it would be, how removed from ordinary life, or how many animals we would see.","I always go to the Cannes Film Festival and it's just such a glamorous time.","I didn't finish my dress until about three days before my wedding - I had the flu and was stitching it from my bed. And the tulle came back from India all brown. We had to wash it for hours, but that didn't dissuade me from wearing it.","My family is my number one priority.","I make sure I carve out time to be with my daughter.","It's funny, because I sometimes feel that I'm most creative when I'm pregnant.","The Indians have such strong traditions and aesthetics, and the people are beautiful, as are their goods.","I love imagining being someone else in another time.","I love vintage and prints.","I'm a designer, not a businesswoman.","My wedding was at home, so I didn't really want to wear a veil in my house. Instead I wore a lot of diamond hair clips. They were brooches, actually, designed by Lorraine Schwartz.","If you've chosen someone to be in your bridal party, she should be a good enough friend that she does not want to upstage you.","I am a control freak.","New York is very career-orientated and it's hard to take time off here, but that is great for building a business.","What I love about my husband is that he really allows me to be the best person I can.","I love children. I've always loved children.","We don't leave home without my daughter's doll La-La. She looks like a bit of a rag, but India is obsessed with her.","I read a lot of thrillers because they're easy reading and I'm not a great flier. They take my head out of it. I like the fast pace and that you can't put them down.","When I got pregnant, I became very interested in natural products. You wonder what you're putting on your skin when you're carrying a child.","I think it's important for whatever you are doing, even if it's a collection, to seek outside advice. If your world becomes too insular, it limits your creativity.","I always have a camera now that I've got a kid, but I don't think I've got one picture of anyone other than my daughter.","It's good to talk to people and get ideas.","I look much more civilized than I actually am.","My mother says I'm like a disease that can walk into a room and get it infected. I can destroy things in seconds.","I enjoyed studying costume, learning about the corsetry and the historical context of fashion. I never had any real intention of being a costume designer.","What an amazing opportunity to do something like direct a movie and step out of your creative comfort zone and yet do something that is also so familiar at the same time. I was also just excited to have the chance to direct, which I may never get to do again.","Sometimes if I can't sleep and I am up in the night, I will start researching things - it could be an image I've seen, or a book I am reading.","I think it's very empowering to be able to have a career and to be a mother. It gives you an amazing sense of self.","I'm an enormous fan of Ron Howard. I mean, he's the most extraordinary director."],"Georgina Haig":["Australians just don't see that many Australian films, but it's also our responsibility as filmmakers and the responsibility of the funding bodies to remember that audiences want to be entertained, and people are entertained in lots of different ways.","When Disney was creating Elsa, they based a lot of her movements on that of a ballerina, which was interesting for me to find out because I actually did ballet years ago. That definitely informed some of the ways I made her walk and move.","Being Australian, I'm probably more used to sunshine and the beach. I've never been skiing, and I think I was already in my 20s when I saw snow for the first time."],"Georgina Reilly":["I'm always sad when a gig ends. No matter how long the shoot, you become a family for the period of time you are together, and then you separate and rarely see each other for a long time after.","I always thought Tinker bell was really cool. I'd like to be able to shrink down to a really small size and fly around to places, play tricks on people... you know, fairy-like stuff."],"Ger Duany":["I was born into Sudan's civil war, and before I could read or write, I was using an AK47 in the conflict between the Muslim north and Animist/Christian south over the land and natural resources.","I would not call it a difficult life, really. I just had a lot of challenges at a very young age.","I knew that I was smart enough to learn. I knew that I could learn, if I could just go to school and not hear gunshots.","It was never easy, but I always tried my best and kept complaints out of my heart by holding tightly onto the hope that one day, I would read and write.","All around the world, there is corruption, tribalism and division, as many find it easier to pick on those that are different, which is why we need to hold tightly to the good in this world.","We are all trying to make it the best way we know how, so when we look at each other as individuals and nations, we should do so with compassion.","My wish is to be a catalyst, to push for solutions, to broker peace talks, to ensure accountability, especially for those who committed and are still organizing unspeakable crimes.","It takes an extraordinary toll on me to re-live my experiences, the horrors of my past and the pain I had to endure. And yet, I believe remembering is the only way to promote healing, to promote awareness and accountability.","We want peace and development in all 10 states of South Sudan - we don't want military backing."],"Geraint Thomas":["I get moody when I'm tired or hungry. My missus says I get moody... but not with other people. But I can get grumpy.","I used to run home from school to watch Paris-Nice, so to win it is just crazy.","Everyone in the world of cycling knows how much it is a team sport as well as individual. It's just amazing to be a part of.","I was fortunate to be born when I was. There's been a massive rise in British cycling since I joined the junior programme when I was 17. It all started in 2004 when Chris Hoy won gold for the 1 km. time trial in Athens; when one person starts doing well, they take everyone with them.","When you're eating salad and quinoa while training, all you want is a burger. In the cycling season, when I'm doing 30-odd hours of exercise a week, I'm dreaming of burgers and curries that I'll have at the end of the season.","I regret not paying a bit more attention to Welsh lessons at school. My Welsh is pretty ropey, as back at my school, people didn't take Welsh lessons seriously. My dad can speak it, so I wish he'd taught me some growing up.","I miss the BBC when I'm away. I'm away so much that it's a pleasure just walking back through the door and sitting on the sofa to watch some rubbish TV.","You get into such a routine of trying so hard each day and racing between 180 and 220 km., and as soon as you stop, it's weird, but you start to seize up. So it's easier if you keep the body ticking over. You just feel better for it come race day."],"Gerald Brenan":["In a happy marriage it is the wife who provides the climate, the husband the landscape.","As I get older I seem to believe less and less and yet to believe what I do believe more and more.","We are closer to the ants than to the butterflies. Very few people can endure much leisure.","The cliche is dead poetry.","If you wish to be brothers, let the arms fall from your hands. One cannot love while holding offensive arms.","You generally hear that what a man doesn't know doesn't hurt him, but in business what a man doesn't know does hurt.","A healthy old fellow, who is not a fool, is the happiest creature living.","Everyone is a bore to someone. That is unimportant. The thing to avoid is being a bore to oneself.","Middle age snuffs out more talent than even wars or sudden death does.","Wisdom is keeping a sense of fallibility of all our views and opinions.","We confess our bad qualities to others out of fear of appearing naive or ridiculous by not being aware of them.","Those who have some means think that the most important thing in the world is love. The poor know that it is money.","Intellectuals are people who believe that ideas are of more importance than values. That is to say, their own ideas and other people's values.","Miller is not really a writer but a non-stop talker to whom someone has given a typewriter."],"Gerald Chertavian":["Mentors provide professional networks, outlets for frustration, college and career counseling, general life advice, and most importantly, an extra voice telling a student they are smart enough and capable enough to cross the stage at graduation and land their first paycheck from a career pathway job.","The millennial generation and a growing number of employees are looking for more than just a paycheck. If a nonprofit could make that easy for me, they are doing me a favor. It's not just a one-way value exchange; it is an internal morale building opportunity.","Many of our students say, 'We wish we had a mentor in high school. We wish we had someone we could spend more time with, who paid more attention to us, who I could sit down with and talk to when I had a problem.' So relationships are critical.","The ABC's are attitude, behavior and communication skills.","One can fall into the 'soft bigotry of low expectations.'","Businesses are no longer receiving the cost savings from outsourcing that they once did.","Year Up for me is a year in which the young adults that we serve have an opportunity to move up in their lives and gain the access and opportunity they need to realize their potential.","Many training programs and often schools focus on just a skill or a kind of work competency. That's only half the equation.","You can learn what you want to learn through hard work. And a good employer will teach you what you want to learn as long as you show the right attitude and behaviors.","The Opportunity Divide doesn't just keep our students disconnected from the mainstream economy; it prevents our businesses from growing.","The saying in business is that, 'You hire for skills and you fire for behavior.' And one would argue that in order to move up in career, to be promoted, to take on additional responsibility, in many ways that's linked more to the attitudes and behaviors that you carry rather than what you know technically about a given subject.","When it comes to expanding opportunity, businesses and young adults are not the sources of the problem - they are a substantial part of the solution.","Years ago, as I was beginning my professional career on Wall Street, I volunteered as a Big Brother in New York City.","You have, unfortunately, a K-12 educational system where the requirements to graduate are not the requirements to be college and career-ready. So if you want young adults who are college and career-ready, our K-12 system right now does not have that as its standard.","College today is an expensive option without a lot of economies of scale, right, when you go and live at a college. So you have a system that's increasing its cost base by probably five percent a year.","I've never been afraid to make a polite ask to someone.","It's not always the case that doing what's right is also doing what's smart, but when it is, the question of 'what to do' should be pretty simple.","Our young immigrants have a lot to offer. They are motivated and hard-working, and in many cases have already contributed significantly to our society - by excelling in school, by volunteering in their communities, or by serving in the military.","At Year Up, our students - low income 18-24 year olds - come to us having already faced substantial obstacles in life. They are not in search of a handout; what they want most of all is the ability to take ownership of their own futures.","At Year Up, we have helped thousands of students rise from poverty into a professional career in a single year.","As we say at Year Up all the time, investing in our young people is not just a matter of economic justice. It's good business sense.","I was taught very early on how you treat people is actually what matters.","When we think about the workplace, people think about hard skills being dominant, but they're not. The employer realizes knowledge will shift quickly, and there's a half-life to knowledge in this world.","The best thing we can do is prepare people to lead in a much more diverse environment and see that as one of our national assets and one of the things that makes America strong."],"Gerald Clarke":["Before Truman Capote, journalism and non-fiction weren't taken very seriously.","In the writing of memoirs, as in the production of shows, too much caution causes the audience to nod and think of other channels.","His theory was that non-fiction could be as artful as fiction.","I don't think Capote loved Smith. But he did make a deep connection. It upset some people, because that had never been the approach to journalistic crime writing, to look into the mind of the killer.","Before Truman, journalism and non-fiction weren't taken very seriously."],"Gerald Clayton":["Some people say that if you do anything other than a straight-ahead groove, that it's not jazz. But that kind of labeling is wrong. Music is what it is; if it sounds good, it sounds good.","The point is to almost be child-minded, like you're discovering music for the first time, every time you play.","I've been boogie-boarding, off and on, since I was a kid. But I started being devoted to the cause of getting up every morning to surf, when I'm in Los Angeles, about a decade or so ago.","A lot of kids have parents who say, 'Music is hard; maybe you should come up with a Plan B.' Whenever I hear that kind of 'advice,' I think it's bad parenting. I was lucky to have a parent who assured me it was a possibility to pursue music.","I'm really open-minded, musically. The credo I ascribe to is, 'Take care of the music, and let the rest take care of itself.' Growing up, I was a sponge and soaked up everything I was exposed to.","When somebody uses a word as a genre distinction, all it really does is trigger certain experiences, or music, that somebody's been exposed to. But that's an individual thing; there's no sort of universal understanding of what jazz is.","I think I knew I was going to be a musician for the rest of my life kind of early. When I was in third grade, I was playing in a talent show, and my dad wrote a two- or three-minute boogie-woogie piece. I played it, everybody loved it, and I was like, 'Wow, this is great.'","I think the main focus as a musician should be to play the music you love to play, and the rest is going to come naturally."],"Gerald Durrell":["All over the world the wildlife that I write about is in grave danger. It is being exterminated by what we call the progress of civilization.","Zoos should concentrate more on the preservation side of things."],"Gerald Edelman":["Science is imagination in the service of the verifiable truth, and that service is indeed communal. It cannot be rigidly planned. Rather, it requires freedom and courage and the plural contributions of many different kinds of people who must maintain their individuality while giving to the group.","Many cognitive psychologists see the brain as a computer. But every single brain is absolutely individual, both in its development and in the way it encounters the world.","Your brain develops depending on your individual history. What has gone on in your own brain and its consciousness over your lifetime is not repeatable, ever - not with identical twins, not even with conjoined twins.","Each brain is exposed to different circumstances. It's very likely that your brain is unique in the history of the universe.","Consciousness allows you the capacity to plan.","The computer is not, in our opinion, a good model of the mind, but it is as the trumpet is to the orchestra - you really need it. And so, we have very massive simulations in computers because the problem is, of course, very complex."],"Gerald F. Lieberman":["Where there is life there is wishful thinking.","Divorce is a declaration of independence with only two signers.","Traditionally the great men of our country have sprung from poor environments; that being so, it would appear we have long suffered from a severe lack of poverty.","Elections are held to delude the populace into believing that they are participating in government.","It is unfair to believe everything we hear about lawyers, some of it might not be true.","There are three subjects on which the knowledge of the medical profession in general is woefully weak; they are manners, morals, and medicine.","It is hard to say why politicians are called servants, unless it is because a good one is hard to find.","In our society a man is known by the company he owns."],"Gerald Finzi":["There is no room in the world, as you say, for second rate work.","But no work from a first rate mind is ever really second rate."],"Gerald Griffin":["Just because I was almost 62, I did not feel decrepit and felt I wasn't finished being a soldier yet.","I found out that colonels can stay until they drop dead or get a walker and being a critical medical specialty as an Army trained emergency room doctor, I could stay until age 67.","There cannot be any better cross-section of America and I think the soldiers represent the best we have. Today's soldiers are brighter and smarter, perhaps in a different way, than past generations because they've been brought up in the computer and information age."],"Gerald J. Ford":["Except from 2002 to 2010, we never went three years without buying a bank.","Rather than going through a commercial banking training program, at the first bank I ever worked in, I was the chairman. And it was my own money, so we loaned it out like it was my own money."],"Gerald Jampolsky":["I can have peace of mind only when I forgive rather than judge.","Inner peace can be reached only when we practice forgiveness. Forgiveness is letting go of the past, and is therefore the means for correcting our misperceptions.","Peace of mind comes from not wanting to change others.","Forgiveness means letting go of the past.","You can be right or you can be happy.","When I am able to resist the temptation to judge others, I can see them as teachers of forgiveness in my life, reminding me that I can only have peace of mind when I forgive rather than judge.","Through our willingness to help others we can learn to be happy rather than depressed.","Love is the total absence of fear. Love asks no questions. Its natural state is one of extension and expansion, not comparison and measurement.","The best way to navigate through life is to give up all of our controls.","Other people do not have to change for us to experience peace of mind.","A truly creative person rids him or herself of all self-imposed limitations."],"Gerald Massey":["Not by appointment do we meet delight Or joy; they heed not our expectancy; But round some corner of the streets of life they of a sudden greet us with a smile.","There's no dearth of kindness In the world of ours; Only in our blindness We gather thorns for flowers."],"Gerald McRaney":["We're one of the forces that causes actors to fasten seat belts before they take off chasing the bad guy in the car... or removes some of the cigarette smoking on television.","Dad built houses and when they were sold, he moved on to a new town, so I know a lot about my native state.","I had to think ahead. How much would I really enjoy committing five or seven years to working on this? When you're an unemployed actor offered a TV pilot, no matter who you are you're tempted by the good hunk of change to be made. It keeps you out of the unemployment line.","For the last four or five years, I had been in the position where I didn't have to take a pilot. I took this one because the script and the people were terrific. It never frightened me. As we were doing the pilot, I could tell that it was working.","The stated mission at the time was simply to use the influence of the entertainment industry to do an accurate portrayal of drug and alcohol abuse. We all admit that we're not trying to censor anybody.","In Hollywood you can't even smoke in a bar anymore and yet in the movies they're always showing people smoking. I don't get it.","Again, like I said, we're not trying to censor anyone. If you think drugs are cool, fine. Make that movie. We are not going to stop you, or try to stop you, but we would encourage other people to be a bit more responsible about their portrayal of drug usage.","I think everybody ought to be allowed to be engaged in athletics at whatever level the audience will accept.","What I know about Mike Tyson, I see in the boxing ring. As far as all of the gossip stuff that I hear about him, I know first hand to take that with a grain of salt.","If you would be just as content winning a local Golden Gloves fight as you would making a pile of money as a professional, then fine, go become a boxer. But if the whole idea is for you to get rich, my God, stay in school and learn a profession."],"Gerald R. Ford":["The political lesson of Watergate is this: Never again must America allow an arrogant, elite guard of political adolescents to by-pass the regular party organization and dictate the terms of a national election.","Tell the truth, work hard, and come to dinner on time.","History and experience tell us that moral progress comes not in comfortable and complacent times, but out of trial and confusion.","I know I am getting better at golf because I am hitting fewer spectators.","A government big enough to give you everything you want is a government big enough to take from you everything you have.","Even though this is late in an election year, there is no way we can go forward except together and no way anybody can win except by serving the people's urgent needs. We cannot stand still or slip backwards. We must go forward now together.","When a man is asked to make a speech, the first thing he has to decide is what to say.","In all my public and private acts as your president, I expect to follow my instincts of openness and candor with full confidence that honesty is always the best policy in the end.","The pat on the back, the arm around the shoulder, the praise for what was done right and the sympathetic nod for what wasn't are as much a part of golf as life itself.","Truth is the glue that holds government together.","Our great Republic is a government of laws and not of men. Here, the people rule.","I watch a lot of baseball on the radio.","My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over.","There are no adequate substitutes for father, mother, and children bound together in a loving commitment to nurture and protect. No government, no matter how well-intentioned, can take the place of the family in the scheme of things.","For millions of men and women, the church has been the hospital for the soul, the school for the mind and the safe depository for moral ideas.","Things are more like today than they have ever been before.","I feel it is my first duty to make an unprecedented compact with my countrymen. Not an inaugural address, not a fireside chat, not a campaign speech - just a little straight talk among friends.","Teddy Roosevelt... once said, 'Speak softly and carry a big stick.' Jimmy Carter wants to speak loudly and carry a fly swatter.","I had pro offers from the Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers, who were pretty hard up for linemen in those days. If I had gone into professional football the name Jerry Ford might have been a household word today.","Our constitution works. Our great republic is a government of laws, not of men.","I have had a lot of adversaries in my political life, but no enemies that I can remember.","A coalition of groups is waging a massive propaganda campaign against the president of the United States. an all-out attack. Their aim is total victory for themselves and total defeat for him.","I am acutely aware that you have not elected me as your President by your ballots, so I ask you to confirm me with your prayers.","I had a lot of experience with people smarter than I am.","Our Constitution works; our great republic is a government of laws and not of men. Here, the people rule.","I am a Ford, not a Lincoln.","I cannot imagine any other country in the world where the opposition would seek, and the chief executive would allow, the dissemination of his most private and personal conversations with his staff, which, to be honest, do not exactly confer sainthood on anyone concerned.","It's the quality of the ordinary, the straight, the square, that accounts for the great stability and success of our nation. It's a quality to be proud of. But it's a quality that many people seem to have neglected.","All my children have spoken for themselves since they first learned to speak, and not always with my advance approval, and I expect that to continue in the future.","I would hope that understanding and reconciliation are not limited to the 19th hole alone.","If Lincoln were alive today, he'd be turning over in his grave.","My commitment to the security and future of Israel is based upon basic morality as well as enlightened self-interest.

They tried to make the masks like Mickey Mouse faces so the children would like them. But I didn't. They had big ears on them.","England was incredibly dull and everything exciting seemed to be in America.","So war is an extremely sad business, because the majority of people don't want to be in it.","You know it's my job to visualize, what is literal or audible, so I designed all the characters, and I designed what they do and how they should do it and so on.","And having suffered for part of the war when I was a child. I was too young to really understand what was going on but one of my favorite pieces of animation now is that Goodbye Blue Sky in The Wall because that deals directly with that period in time.","And then I think they asked me to work on Wish You Were Here, which was the next album coming up. And I didn't do anything for a long time. I had other projects, and I didn't get around to doing anything for a bit.","And um, when I came back to England I put a very complex soundtrack on it, featuring everyone from Jimi Hendrix, right through to Neil Diamond, you know, everybody that was kind of popular who was kind of popular at that time.","And when Roger talks about the frightened ones running away from the bombs, I immediately thought of my days when I was young and I had to wear these gas masks.","How do I feel about war? Well anybody I guess, I hope, I don't like it.","I have been to several wars to draw. I went to Vietnam. And made drawings in Vietnam during that period of the war there, and found that to be a very very sad situation.","I haven't done a book for about 3 or 4 years now.","I just recently did a film with Disney, and they put the drawings straight on the computer. And it's all painted on the computer now and not by hand anymore.","I mean when I was working shall we say with Disney, you know they sent me the script for the film Hercules and I had to imagine what all the characters looked like. And to develop those characters, so nothing exists visually when I get the script.","I think that an artist is a bit like a computer. He receives information from the world around him and from his past and from his own experiences. And it all goes into the brain.","So the whole of war, when you look at it is probably run by professional soldiers, and the rest of them are just recruits, or people who are just forced to join the army.","So, I created these creatures called The Frightened Ones which in the film you see do have mask like kind of heads and they run beneath the ground to hide. Which is what in fact we did during the war.","Well I was an asthmatic child. So that for most of my childhood I was in bed. Bedridden.","Where as in animation you have to kind of do a series of drawings in between to complete the movement."],"Gerald Vann":["If you say that the history of the Church is a long succession of scandals, you are telling the truth, though if that is all you say, you are distorting the truth.","Some people think that prayer just means asking for things, and if they fail to receive exactly what they asked for, they think the whole thing is a fraud.","Nothing is more depressing and more illogical than aggressive Christianity.","To help all created things, that is the measure of all our responsibility; to be helped by all, that is the measure of our hope."],"Gerald Vizenor":["I use not casual phrases but imagistic phrases that create a rhythm of natural presence.","If you desecrate a white grave, you wind up sitting in prison.

But Indians have been engaged all over the world for centuries, in Europe, even in Asia.","The first Western teacher of English in Japan was a Native American.","Trickster stories are pleasurable, contradictory, annoying, abrasive. They're powerful, transformational acts of liberation because they are not nailed down to the real, to the representation of something in the world.","The idea of victimage is a dreadful thing, a product of a safe middle-class perspective. What people who are not safe develop is a tragic wisdom, a wisdom that embraces contradiction and seeks a sense of balance rather than going to extremes.","Naanabozho was the first tribal trickster on the earth.","There is a sense of motion and a concise, immediate image in haikus and Anishinaabe dream songs.","Even the earliest cave paintings in France and Spain had natural motion.","It's so difficult to write in motion and get rid of the past tense, and also to create a sense of impermanence.","W. P. Kinsella, who was born on a farm near Edmunton, Alberta, has earned wide recognition for his wild imagination and rash humor as a writer.","There are 13 stories in 'The Fencepost Chronicles' about corrupt tribal leaders, trouble on the reserve, survival schemes, and communal drinking.","Confucius would give his seat to an old woman. Communist cadres, on the other hand, took the best seats and called it a cultural revolution.","The great liberation of imaginative writing is that you're not held back by the facts.","Mixed-bloods loosen the seams in the shrouds of identities."],"Gerald W.

When I hear an ambulance siren, I ask for a blessing for those people in trouble, knowing that no one's listening. I think it's just a habit of mindfulness.","Because I worked as a newspaper reporter for about 14 years before attempting my first novel, I learned to write under almost any circumstances- by candle light, in longhand, in African villages where there was no power, under shelling in Kurdistan.","Writing is like bricklaying; you put down one word after another. Sometimes the wall goes up straight and true and sometimes it doesn't and you have to push it down and start again, but you don't stop; it's your trade.","Sydney in the 1960s wasn't the exuberant multicultural metropolis it is today. Out in the city's western reaches, days passed in a sun-struck stupor. In the evenings, families gathered on their verandas waiting for the 'southerly buster' - the thunderstorm that would break the heat and leave the air cool enough to allow sleep.","It is my great good luck the words I use are English words, which means I live in a very old nation of open borders; a rich, deep, multi-layered, promiscuous universe, infused with Latin, German, French, Greek, Arabic and countless other tongues.","The thing that most attracts me to historical fiction is taking the factual record as far as it is known, using that as scaffolding, and then letting imagination build the structure that fills in those things we can never find out for sure.","There are always a few who stand up in times of communal madness and have the courage to say that what unites us is greater than what divides us.","For most people, chemotherapy is no longer the chamber of horrors we often conceive it to be. Yes, it is an ordeal for some people, but it wasn't for me, nor for most of the patients I got to know during my four months of periodic visits to the chemo suite.","One thing I believe completely is that the human heart remains the human heart, no matter how our material circumstances change as we move together through time.","September 11, 2001, revealed heroism in ordinary people who might have gone through their lives never called upon to demonstrate the extent of their courage.","My mother's family were full-on Irish Catholics - faith in an elaborate old fashioned, highly conservative and madly baroque style. I sort of fell out of the tribe over women's rights and social justice issues when I was just 13 years old.","We are not the only animal that mourns; apes do, and elephants, and dogs. Yet we are the only one that tortures.","I think I'm still chewing on my years as a foreign correspondent. I found myself covering catastrophes - war, uprising, famine, refugee crises - and witnessing how people were affected by dire situations. When I find a story from the past, I bring some of those lessons to bear on the narrative.","And when I'd be reporting in Israel, Palestinians would say, the Jews they're not like us, and the Jews would say the same things about the Palestinians, they don't want what we want. And I never bought it as a reporter and I don't buy it as a novelist. I think, you know, the sound of somebody crying for their lost child sounds the same.","I think that you can honour the sacrifices of a common soldier without glorifying war.","And one of the things that I learned was you can't generalise at all about a woman in a veil. You can't think you know her story, because she will confound you over and over again. She may be an engineer or a diplomat or a doctor. Or she may be an unbelievable babe with bleached hair down to her waist.","Both my mum and dad were great readers, and we would go every Saturday morning to the library, and my sister and I had a library card when we could pass off something as a signature, and all of us would come with an armful of books.","I write while my son is at school. At about 7:45 A.M., I walk him there, with the dogs, then walk them for another forty minutes or so, go home and chain myself to the desk a little before 9 A.M., and try not to be distracted until I hear my son plunge through the front door at about 3 P.M.","I can always write. Sometimes, to be sure, what I write is crap, but it's words on the page and therefore it is something to work with.","My sentences tend to be very short and rather spare. I'm more your paragraph kind of gal.","Moral certainty can deafen people to any truth other than their own.","The structure of 'March' was laid down for me before the first line was written, because my character has to exist within Louisa May Alcott's 'Little Women' plotline.","While I love to read contemporary fiction, I'm not drawn to writing it. Perhaps it's because the former journalist in me is too inhibited by the press of reality; when I think about writing of my own time I always think about nonfiction narratives. Or perhaps it's just that I find the present too confounding.","Jewish prayers are mostly about daily things - the sliver of a new moon, dew on the grass, the bread and the wine.","I'm very, very leery of nonfiction books where they change timeframes and use - what do they call those things? - composite characters. I don't think that's right.","The Sarajevans have a very particular world view - a mordant wit coupled with this unbearable sadness and... truckloads of guts, you know.","Certainly I'm still mining my experiences as a journalist. I think it's no coincidence that all three of my novels basically are about how people act in a time of catastrophe. Do they go to their best self or their worst self?","If you look at an illuminated manuscript, even today, it just blows your mind. For them, without all the clutter and inputs that we have, it must have been even more extraordinary.","The day in 2004 when the radiologist told me I had invasive cancer, I walked down the hospital corridor looking for a phone to call my husband, and I could almost see the fear coming toward me like a big, black shadow.","I had been afraid of breast cancer, as I suspect most women are, from the time I hit adolescence. At that age, when our emerging sexuality is our central preoccupation, the idea of disfigurement of a breast is particularly horrifying.","If screenwriters have to kill off a female character, they love to give her cancer. We've seen so many great actresses go down to the Big C: Ali MacGraw, Meryl Streep, Emma Thompson, Debra Winger, Susan Sarandon.","'You've got mail!' exclaims the cheery automaton at America Online. The flag on the mailbox icon waves invitingly on my computer screen. For a second, I'm 10 years old again, waiting for the postman's whistle to slice the stillness of an Australian afternoon.","Sometimes I want to have a mental book burning that would scour my mind clean of all the filthy visions literature has conjured there. But how to do without 'The Illiad?' How to do without 'Macbeth?'","Even the classics that we read to our young children are full of wolves' fangs and burning ovens and bloody feet and ice shards piercing hearts. Even the New Testament climaxes with an act of unspeakable torture. Might as well just read to our kids from the Amnesty Annual Report and be done with it.","I do believe that our modern English usage has become way too clipped and austere. I have been reading excerpts from the journals of 18th-century seafarers lately, and even the lowliest press-ganged deck-swabber turns a finer phrase than I do most days.","If somebody from the past doesn't rise up from the grave and start talking to me, I haven't got a book. I have to hear that voice, the voice of the narrator. How she sounds will tell me who she is, and who she is will tell me how she will act - and that starts the plot in motion.","You can't write about the past and ignore religion. It was such a fundamental, mind-shaping, driving force for pre-modern societies. I'm very interested in what religion does to us - its capacity to create love and empathy or hatred and violence.","I was so shy. I used to cross the street so I wouldn't even have to talk to my relatives, much less strangers. That's not shy, that's wise. But I found that that when you had a journalist's notebook in your hand it wasn't really you, you see.","I think probably the scaredest I've ever been was in Somalia. I arrived there when the episode that became known as 'Black Hawk Down' was still taking place. The Americans were still pinned down under fire. And everybody else was basically going the other way, and I was the only one putting my hand up for a flight in.","The dirty little secret of foreign correspondents is that 90 per cent of it is showing up. If you can find a way to get there, the story, the reporting, it's the easiest you'll ever do. 'Cause the drama's everywhere.","So, you know, Nathaniel was my first child, born when I was 40, so, uh... And then in due course, he wanted a brother, and then I thought, 'Oh, that'll be bloody lucky!' So, we ended up adopting a beautiful boy who was then five years old, from Ethiopia.","There's just so many great stories in the past that you can know a little bit about, but you can't know it all, and that's where imagination can work.","I'd gotten myself into a kind of journalism that wasn't really compatible with rearing an infant. I'd been a foreign correspondent for a long time and had this subspecialty in covering catastrophes. It had spoiled me a little because you have a tremendous amount of autonomy, and I couldn't really see being an editor in an office.","I had this story that had been banging around in my head and I thought, 'I'll just see if there's anything there.' So I wrote a few chapters of the book that became 'Year of Wonders,' and lucky for me it found its readers.","Yes, it seems we've got this mutant gene in our human personality that makes us susceptible to this same kind of mistake over and over again. It's really uncanny how we build these beautiful multicultural edifices and then allow this switch to be flipped and everybody goes, 'Oh, the other, get them out of here.'","I knew I was going to be a journalist when I was eight years old and I saw the printing presses rolling at the Sydney newspaper where my dad worked as a proofreader.","Yes, the small village that we live in, in Virginia, is a very interesting place, in terms of its Civil War history, because it was a town that was founded by Quakers in 1733.","When you're writing non-fiction, you go as far as you can go, and then ethically you have to stop. You can't go. You can't suppose. You can't imagine. And I think there's something in human nature that wants to finish the story.","Both my parents loved words. That was the big deal in our house.","I was a pretty delicate kid. Anything that was going around I'd get it and I'd generally get it much worse than other people, so I spent a lot of time out of school.","I loved being away from school. I didn't really fancy school that much when I was little; it wasn't until I was in third or fourth grade that I really settled down at school and I was much happier at home with my mum and she was very creative and sort of fostered all my interests.","I swim in a sea of words. They flow around me and through me and, by a process that is not fully clear to me, some delicate hidden membrane draws forth the stuff that is the necessary condition of my life.","When I write a word in English, a simple one, such as, say, 'chief,' I have unwittingly ushered a querulous horde into the room. The Roman legionary is there, shaking his cap, or head, and Andy Capp is there, slouching in his signature working man's headgear.","I was a news reporter for 16 years, seven of them a foreign correspondent in the Middle East, Africa and the Balkans. Perhaps the most useful equipment I acquired in that time is a lack of preciousness about the act of writing. A reporter must write. There must be a story. The mot juste unarriving? Tell that to your desk."],"Geraldine Chaplin":["Drugs are marvelous if you want to escape, but reality is so rich, why escape?","I didn't fall in love with acting until I did a few films. Now, I couldn't live without it.","It's the change of rhythm which I think is what keeps me alive. In Spain I hear so much noise from my window that can't stand it. In Switzerland it's the lack of noise that drives me crazy.","When I'm depressed and I feel low thinking that good movies are not made any more, then I put on his movies and I watch them. I laugh and I cry and I have great pleasure.","I was born in Santa Monica but brought up abroad so I don't use English much.","I live in a Swiss village so small, if you sneeze everyone knows."],"Geraldine Ferraro":["I'd call it a new version of voodoo economics, but I'm afraid that would give witch doctors a bad name.","I do believe in the power of prayer.","You don't have to have fought in a war to love peace.","President Reagan's one-liners were terrific.","But I do think its necessary to have debates.","I don't consider myself a survivor; that's someone who has gone through something terrible.","I have been extremely lucky; I am a person who is currently living with a cancer that is under control.","My desk drawer is filled with all kinds of prayers.","If you think somebody cares about you and believes your life is worth saving, how can you give up?","Vice president - it has such a nice ring to it!","You people married to Italian men, you know what it's like.","I don't like to practice ahead of time what I'm going to say.","If you ask me a question, don't tell me what the question is in advance, 'cause I'd rather not know.","And it was, it was not beating George Bush, believe it or not, the bottom line as far as I was concerned was introducing to the public who Gerry Ferraro was.","I didn't look very sensitive and they didn't know me very well.","The polls indicated that I was feisty, that I was tough, that I had a sense of humor, but they weren't quite sure if they liked me and they didn't know whether or not that I was sensitive.","But I made one mistake which I would never repeat as a member of Congress when I was in Washington, and that was when I was elected I didn't go on trips because I was so afraid of having someone accuse me of taking junkets.","I didn't serve on a committee that dealt with foreign policy.","We had prepared, my staff had prepared for me a whole dossier on virtually - on George Bush on his votes on his records, what he had done over the past number of years in public service.","I readily admit I was not an expert on foreign policy but I was knowledgeable and I didn't need a man who was the Vice President of the United States and my opponent turning around and putting me down.","I was a trial lawyer when I was elected to Congress.","I enjoyed debate on the floor but it's not really debate in the same way.","See that's a goal that I think it's very good in the debate to find out who the person is.","People who live through transplants or disasters like Sept. 11 are survivors.","I'm a happy camper because by doing this I have an opportunity to be on the cutting edge of research.","What are my sources of strength? My husband and my three kids, my health-care team, and my religion.","The bottom line as far as I was concerned was presenting to the public who Gerry Ferraro was.","For one thing, one of the wonderful things that we now have is instead of the huge budget surpluses that President Clinton left us with, we now have these huge deficits that we're going to be facing into the future.","And I have to tell you as a grandmother, I worry about the fact that my grandchildren are going to be paying for all the spending, including military spending, that has gone on and the tax cuts that have come through.","We were so shocked by how fast that war went that President Bush did not have a plan, a peace plan."],"Geraldine McCaughrean":["I had a very happy childhood, but I still used my imagination as a leisure resort.","I read hugely as a child, but I slowed up when the print got smaller. I am a very slow reader. I don't know why. Maybe it is like some people chewing their food for ages and some wolfing it down.","Never apologise for not being someone else. You're bound to find something you're good at, even if it's only writing stories.","When people write fan-fic sequels to one of your books, it gives you a very strange feeling. It is very flattering but strange, as if the characters have come to life again without you knowing.","You sort of suspect if a book's fun to write, it will be fun to read.","Writing is writing to me. I'm incapable of saying no to any writing job, so I've done everything - historical fiction, myths, fairy tales, anything that anybody expresses any interest in me writing, I'll write. It's the same reason I used to read as a child: I like going somewhere else and being someone else.","My brother, whom I adored, typed out a children's book illustrated by himself... at the age of 14. My sister, with whom I always shared a double bed, had that effortless superiority of someone six years older and anxious to show it. But we were each as shy as voles. It seemed safer to keep to each other's company.","I always thought writer's block was something that prats used as an easy excuse for not doing any work.","You need to be able to climb into a narrative and zip it up under your chin. You need to be able to see through the eyes of the hero, smell what he's smelling, hear what he's hearing.","I wept my way through teaching practice.","Most of my central characters lack confidence but overcome their timidity or low self-esteem to win through in the end, so I suppose there is a kind of wish-fulfillment at work.","The one thing that makes writing a better pastime than reading is that you can make things turn out the way you want in the end!","I like working in children's books because it gives rise to such a variety of jobs. One month it may be a picture book, the next a retelling, the next a play, a short story or the start of the next novel.","I still keep thinking someone will penetrate my guilty secret - that I have been masquerading as a writer all these years while all I was really doing was enjoying myself, pursuing my passion.","'Would I mind if someone wrote a sequel to one of my books?' I asked myself, and I decided that I wouldn't, providing that the writer was respectful, had read my book first, and wasn't drunk when doing it.","I started writing because I found I could spend more time in my own imagination by doing that than I could by reading.","The chief thing is to make children feel good about themselves. They want to step into the shoes of a hero who is bigger and stronger, to face tremendous dangers and come home safely for tea.","I never dreamt I could be an author when I grew up. It just didn't occur to me, because I thought you had to be a) academic, so go to university, things like that, and I didn't think I was clever, or b) dead because I just assumed all the authors in the library were dead.","Well, unfortunately, my father passed away before my first book was published, so he never lived to see me as an author. But I think my mum was suitably pleased because she was mad about words. If she ever came across a word that she didn't know, she would always look it up in the dictionary.","I simply don't understand authors that know everything before they write it; it seems so cold blooded. I think it's lovely when the story takes over and goes somewhere else.","My mum used to tell me to never boil my cabbages twice, and I think it's artistically valid. While I do find myself on similar themes in my books, I try not to repeat myself, and that's something which is all too easy to do in series books.","I'm not one of those people who had a burning passion for 'Peter Pan' all my life. Although I can't remember a time when I didn't know the story, I didn't carry around with me an ambition to one day write the sequel.","It isn't that I don't tackle issues; it's just that they're secondary to giving somebody an escape route from the banal routine of everyday life."],"Geraldine McEwan":["'Miss Marple' enjoys every minute of her existence and is not worried about getting old.","During the war, my mother used to take me to the local repertory theatre on a Monday night, and we used to get two seats for the price of one, for nine pence, in the gods.","A book becomes something else once it's dramatized.","I've spent all my life playing roles that illustrious people have played before me.","When I was asked to play 'Miss Marple,' I was given the Kevin Elyot script for 'The Body in the Library.' I was a fan of his theatre work anyway, and I just thought it was brilliant. I was immediately taken by 'Miss Marple,' so I read some of the novels, and I knew I had to do it.","I feel I could be walking down the street, and if somebody talked to me, I could just slot into 'Miss Marple' and know how she would react.","People do stop me a lot, and what is really very rewarding is that the ages of the people who stop me vary so widely. Surprisingly, there are a lot of young people - even children.","Quite honestly, I think that if you are making a lot of television programs with a central character, then ultimately it can become boring if you know nothing about them. I personally want to know, or get to know, things about a character. It doesn't mean to say that they still can't have a certain mystery about them."],"Geraldine Page":["If I read a part and think I can connect to it, that I can touch people with it, I will do it, no matter what its size. And if I think I can't do something with a part, I won't take it.","I didn't want to be a Hollywood actress who every so often does a Broadway play. I wanted to be a Broadway actress who every so often does a movie.","I always wanted to be good at something, to be somebody. The minute I got into my first play, which was called 'Excuse My Dust' - I was 17 at the time - I knew that this was what I'd been looking for.","A lot of people say I always play neurotic women. Well, who doesn't play neurotic women?","The main thing is the ability to control your instrument, which, in the actor, is yourself. Look the way you want the character to look. Sound the way you want the character to sound. Once you've trained the instrument to do what you want, you're in control, and you're free.","In 'Summer and Smoke,' I was supposed to be a plain-Jane wallflower, and instead, I had all these costumes. I looked like a Barbie doll.","I keep getting offered these women-with-a-disease things.","I love the Oscars. All sorts of tacky people win. And watching everyone run up and down those aisles is just adorable.","'Greedy gut' is my middle name. I love food, and I love parts.","I have played old ladies since I was 17 years old, and very convincingly. I've always looked funny and was too tall to play the leads and so had to play the grandmothers.","They did cast me as an ingenue once, and the novelty was nice. But I said, 'There is nothing here to play!' I really like getting into the meat of a role.","I always say it's worth doing what you want to do, not letting people manipulate you. It's worth holding out. It's worth having pride."],"Geraldine Stutz":["My gift, if I have one, is choosing terrific talent and providing the atmosphere for them to do their best work.","When you can't afford to have the best, you hire the young who are going to be the best.","I feel bad that I never discussed my mother's life and times as a career woman with her.","Marriage is a linchpin in many women's lives, but many other things can create a satisfying life. I adore my career. It stretches every physical, emotional, and intellectual muscle I have.","The fact was that I had always been considered a leader in my scholastic career. It just never dawned on me that this was any kind of preparation for the business world. Like most young women of my background and education, I always performed on demand and never anything else.","What is the difference between fashion and style? Fashion says, 'Me, too,' and style, 'Only me.'"],"Geraldo Rivera":["I think of myself as Special Forces, clearing the path for the infantry.","Mother Nature may be forgiving this year, or next year, but eventually she's going to come around and whack you. You've got to be prepared.","Never take a job where winter winds can blow up your pants.","I'd like to give divorce a good name.","I'm old, but I'm still cute and strong. And very butch.","Rich people who own mansions on the beach shouldn't get federal subsidies. If you want to stay there, take the risk.","To see those babies with no food for three of four days, old people sitting in the hot sun, when you see these poor people, you cannot help but being compassionate or affected.","Extol Jewish virtue, modern Zionism and the Israeli Defense Forces.","Give Hamas 90 days to pick a lane, then react.","I've made a connection with the television audience by being a proud Latino man. I am passionate for what I do, courageous in the face of peril, honest and straightforward.","I am enduring. You can disagree with me.","I must be doing something right. I've been around for a long time.","I speak Spanish to my children and they speak it better than me.","I'd work to make it hip again to spend time in our fabled and fabulous land. But with a Puerto Rican father and a Jewish mother, I would probably be better suited as mayor of New York.","I'm in my 10th generation of TV critic now.","It's a great pleasure having survived six generations of TV critics.","Jackson and I spent the day together, just me and him and his children. Little underlings came and went. The PR person came and went. It was just Michael and me and the kids. And it was very interesting.","One thing about these storms, we know how disruptive things can be when we depend on the system to keep working. What would happen if the terrorists do it? Knock down the power, destroy bridges, cut the water supply?","Perhaps areas of Israel where current large Palestinian populations and demographic realities exist could be exchanged for Israeli expansion into the West Bank to include most of East Jerusalem.","Reject racial or religious hate. Embrace moderate Islam.","Saturday Night Live is hitting me on a regular basis again. This is my fourth decade that I've been lampooned on Saturday Night Live.","The biggest stories in 2005 were the national disasters.","The courage in journalism is sticking up for the unpopular, not the popular.","The elite media has been caught in so many lies because of false statements that its whole reputation has eroded, their circulation is down, and their profits are down.","The real Michael Jackson that has not been seen... with children, one in diapers, the other two toddlers.","There's no way New Orleans will ever be the city it was. I think it will have half the population. They may create a sort of Disneyland at the French Quarter for tourists. The rest I don't know.","This is the year of Katrina and Iraq. How the war ends is more important than how it began. However you feel about the war, you have to be compassionate and loving towards our troops.","When a Spanish man cries it's not a sign of weakness.","With years of experience doing whatever it takes to get to the bottom of each story, I am looking forward to covering the stories in the human dimension and impart the passion and visceral reactions the audience seeks.","Your performance gets you promoted. It doesn't matter if you're brown, back or white.","I'm tired of getting made fun of."],"Gerard Arpey":["At American Airlines, we have built a business around the love of travel that has lasted three quarters of a century. And I'm pretty sure we're just getting started.","Second, we have to make the most of the strengths we have, the amenities that many of our competitors cannot replicate. But again, those advantages won't mean much if we don't do a great job with the basics of our business.","We need to take excellent care of our customers, and do so at a profit.","These are times of unprecedented challenge and change in the airline industry, and the appointments we are announcing today will put American in an even stronger position to continue the substantial progress that has already been made under the tenets of our Turnaround Plan.","We continued the hard work of integrating TWA, because at that time we still thought an efficient connecting hub in St. Louis could be a profitable addition to our network.","However, the economics of our business continued to deteriorate. We barely escaped bankruptcy a year ago, and in the aftermath of that escape we had to make some even tougher decisions.","One of our most difficult realizations was that - in the course of two years - a connecting hub in St. Louis had gone from something we thought we needed to something we could no longer afford.","Despite the painful changes we have had to make, we continue to believe in the St. Louis market. And we are hoping to add flights, in a careful way, as the economics of our business improve and the demands of the traveling public in St. Louis become clear.","But I definitely see us playing a major role in St. Louis in the years to come. We already provide service to 95 percent of the markets St. Louis travelers visit the most. And we're adding capacity in some of the most important markets.","First, we have to lower our costs to levels that are more competitive. This will prevent the lower-cost airlines from pushing us out of the markets we want to serve. We've made great progress on this front, but we need to keep pushing.","I think in just about any business the low cost competitor is always going to have an advantage.","That doesn't mean you have to have the lowest costs in the industry to succeed. But you need to make sure the activities and product attributes that increase your costs above the other guy bring in at least that much more in revenue, and hopefully more.","Our Fly Smart philosophy is about investing only on those points of differentiation that pay for themselves, that earn a revenue premium commensurate with what it costs us to provide that product or service.","But I don't think the popularity of flying has diminished a bit.","Just to cover the increase in fuel costs over the past two years, American would have had to raise fares nearly $75 per round-trip ticket. During this time period, our average fare increased by only $15.","This airline is grateful for his extensive contributions and we will miss his friendship and support. We extend our deepest sympathies to the Casey family on its personal loss.","Markets that don't work we're going to step away from.","We have, unlike many of our competitors, continued to meet our various financial obligations.","The executive moves we are announcing today will strengthen American for the long-term future and reflect well on the depth of the Company's management team.","Our planes should be full, which among other things means we have a golden opportunity... to build on the momentum reflected in the financial results we are reporting today.","It is not good thinking - either at the corporate level or at the personal level - to believe you can simply walk away from your circumstances."],"Gerard Butler":["I love doing the stunts. It's as simple as that.","I love a girl with a good sense of humour, who is confident but who has a sweetness to her - that melts my heart.","I wasn't going to be an actor. I was going to be a lawyer. I came from a family just above working class, just below middle class, a great family of wonderful values. The idea of me having a chance for a law degree was enticing. Enticing to me but also very enticing to my family.","My overwhelming memory of being a child is the huge amount of love I felt for my mum. She was my everything, because she was both my mum and my dad.","I was amazed and upset by the looks I got just walking around the studio... It illuminates the ugliness and the beauty that exists within each of us, and that's what this story represents to me.","I sang in a rock band when I was training as a lawyer. You know, not professional, we just did it for fun. We just did gigs all over Edinburgh and some in Glasgow and some at festivals.","I was training to be a lawyer... I was president of the law society at Glasgow University, and my bass guitarist was my secretary of my law society; the lead guitarist and writer worked at the law firm that I worked.","As long as you do the best work that you can and not make it bland... because you're going down a lane that is trying to make everybody happy. You have to take an angle on these things.","I see a lot of actors for whom life becomes one big schedule. I guess I try to be more sensitive to my private life - to take a breath of fresh air and be in the countryside or on a golf course.","The problem with my mind is it sways from side to side. The idea of me fantasizing about becoming an actor quickly led to depression. 'No, it was never going to happen to me.' I was a sixteen-year-old kid on the other side of the world from where they made movies. Scottish actors never really got play. There was Sean Connery, and that was it.","'300' was a real turning point in my career. Until then, I felt like a steam train that was slowly chugging to the top of a hill. Now I'm over that hill, my career seems to have its own momentum.","It's always more interesting to make a movie about what is relevant in your society. What's the political global backdrop? What are our threats? What are we vulnerable to? Because that's what an audience vibes on - that is what people are interested in, universally.","Funnily enough, when I originally went in for my screen test, that set was already built.","Angelina came up, and as soon as we said hello, I thought, This is going to be great. I'm really going to love doing this with her. And I did. And then I was very excited to do the movie after that.","My manager and my agents, they go over my contracts.","By that point, I had started taking singing lessons. And after the first session, I mean, I was surprised that the windows didn't shatter. And after the third session, I really didn't know where this voice had come from.","I had to go and sing with the musical director of the film, Simon Lee, who is just incredible, and it went great. I sang with him about five things, things we'd worked on. And then I went to sing for Andrew Lloyd Weber.","I had to prove myself to a lot of different people.","I started singing for The Phantom in January, and we started filming in October and I sang all the way through to the next June. In fact, I was singing for about two months before I even knew I had the role.","Generally I don't like doing remakes, but I think that's more in the cynical world of Hollywood where normally remakes are purely for commercial reasons.","I always find stuff in my characters to relate to.","The Phantom, as well as being backed up by that music, it just so was a role that I identified with so powerfully. From the first second that I walked on to perform.","The chance to be both artistically appreciated and commercially appreciated... That's what you hope for.","I had to get used to wearing a mask and wearing a prosthetic and performing with those things while singing and expressing myself through stylized movement, while keeping it as human as possible so the audience could be closer to the horror of the Phantom.","Choosing the right mask helps you... We went through many masks. It was very particular leather that as soon as you smudged it, you had to get a new one. We went through about 55 masks.","I went from somebody who didn't sing to somebody who didn't speak.","I was getting to bed about 10 P.M. so wound up and not getting to sleep by 11, and because I was putting the prosthetics on for five hours, I had to be up at 3 in the morning.","I knew I'd just done one of the most amazing things that I will ever get a chance to do. Just to be part of a musical that's not your background and to pull it off and to think that we've done something that's really special.","In Scotland, I'm just like a lot of other guys, but in America, I'm seen as a very strong, masculine guy.","I love to spend a lot of time on my own. I can seriously go into my own head and often love to let myself travel where I don't know where I'm going.","Sometimes I finish a movie, and I get used to a certain lifestyle, and when that stops, I get a bit lost for about a week. 'No one is bringing me lunch anymore - I've got to go do that myself?' I lose the main point of my focus.","Manscaping and all of that is not my thing. I'm more of the Clint Eastwood kind of guy.","When I'm 80 and sagging all over, I can tell my grandkids, 'Look, when I was a lad, 'People' magazine thought I was sexy!'","I was born in Glasgow. But my family is pretty much from a little town called Paisley, famous for its cotton mills and paisley pattern.","I did spend a lot of my childhood playing out movie scenarios in my head. I'd walk along the road, pretending like I was in the army, talking on the radio, and doing maneuvers. I dreamt a lot about performing in movies and living in fantasies.","I go to Scotland maybe three times a year, and I love it. When I'm at home, I feel at home, I feel myself, I feel connected.","It was always a dream as I was growing up. I would watch movies, mostly American movies, and be so engrossed in those stories, all I wanted to do was be there. I wanted to be part of that romance or that fantasy or be that warrior or that struggling soul who finally makes it good.","I remember when 'Grease' came out, I used to force my mum to try and grease my hair back, and it was never long enough, and literally I'd be screaming at her, 'Do it. Just do it!'.","9/11 was basically caused by box cutters, and that changed the world.","I wear a lot of Brioni and Ferragamo and Dolce, all of those kind of things.","Ever since I was a child, I have loved being the centre of attention, but similarly, I can't remember a time in my life that I haven't battled with all sorts of quandaries, fears and weaknesses.","My problem is, whether it's for emotion or for the talents that a character has to have in a role, I find it very difficult to not take on a challenge. For instance, 'Phantom Of The Opera,' in truth, scared the crap out of me, but I wasn't going to walk away and say, 'I didn't do that because I didn't believe in myself.'","There's a great sense of achievement, testosterone, fun, being able to live out your masculinity when you play an action role or an action-adventure or a real tough-guy role.","So many actors get caught up in their technique, and to be honest, I see it really getting in the way. I see them forcing things. I definitely do my best work when I'm free of that. But I think as an actor, I work really hard in preparing the roles.","When I was a vocalist, a lead singer in a rock band, I was a law student at the time. It wasn't a professional rock band, it was for fun. I was already way out of that by the time Phantom came along. Having to learn to sing, it was such duress, having to really try and get to such a quality.","To me, it's always good to retain a sense of wonder and never good too big for life, like you've seen it all before.","I have literally run into 20 people all around the world with my face tattooed on them.","I've had broken bones and cuts and dashes and tears from movies, but when I was five, my mom put the biscuits up high so we wouldn't be helping ourselves. So, one day I asked to stand up on a chair to get a biscuit, and it fell, and the corner of the chair went right into the side of my eye, and it made a big hole in there."],"Gerard De Nerval":["Every flower is a soul blossoming in nature.","The tree of knowledge is not the tree of life! And yet can we cast out of our spirits all the good or evil poured into them by so many learned generations? Ignorance cannot be learned.","When the soul drifts uncertainly between life and the dream, between the mind's disorder and the return to cool reflection, it is in religious thought that we should seek consolation.","The first moments of sleep are an image of death; a hazy torpor grips our thoughts and it becomes impossible for us to determine the exact instant when the 'I,' under another form, continues the task of existence.","It has been rightly said that nothing is unimportant, nothing powerless in the universe; a single atom can dissolve everything, and save everything! What terror! There lies the eternal distinction between good and evil.","Our dreams are a second life. I have never been able to penetrate without a shudder those ivory or horned gates which separate us from the invisible world.","God is dead!"],"Gerard Debreu":["I had become interested in economics, an interest that was transformed into a lifetime dedication when I met with the mathematical theory of general economic equilibrium.","In the mid-'60s in Berkeley, the theory of measure spaces of economic agents became one of my main interests.","The Cowles Commission was the optimal environment for the type of research that I wanted to do.","The dark outside world of Paris under German occupation exerted a strong containing pressure."],"Gerard Depardieu":["Cooking is not difficult. Everyone has taste, even if they don't realize it. Even if you're not a great chef, there's nothing to stop you understanding the difference between what tastes good and what doesn't.","When you have heart disease, you start to be tired of everything. It's like getting older. You become more white, and after that, grey. You have no feeling for anything.","I gain weight and lose it again in inevitable cycles.","My unrealized ambition is to tend my vines, produce wine, and work like an artisan. I dream of rediscovering the old traditions and customs of wine growing, not necessarily to deny the technology which we have today, but to harness it and work in harmony with nature.","I am a free man. I feel at home everywhere in Europe.","I don't snack all the time, but I do sometimes drink l more than I should.","I consider myself a free man and a citizen of the world.","In the film industry, all the money is focused on television and the stupidity of American cinema.","I have learnt a lot about my body since my heart attack. I don't drink as much now as before.","I had rapidly become aware there were problems with the Kalifa group.","I like the idea of bringing cartoon characters to life... and although the Americans have already attempted this, their culture is not sufficiently humane to make it work.","If cinema is a woman then certainly there are many shores.","I would never let myself knock out a journalist.","I've had affairs. But I'm not the sort of man who has 10,000 affairs.","The relationship between an actor and a director is like a love story between a man and a woman. I'm sure sometimes I'm the woman.","I never really like the characters I play. I only come to love them afterwards.","I'm living in the present. I have no ambition. It's true. But I want to live.","I'm curious about people. That's what I've always done since I've been a small boy. I'm curious about others.","I do this profession. I'm an actor. And it is, for me, an opportunity to meet people.","One of the advantages of my profession is I come into contact with many people.","Authenticity is the ability to listen to what nature tells us. Listening isn't the same thing as never making a mistake, but the important thing is to learn.","In Hollywood, you still have wonderful actors, but it's so hard to work there. To work becomes a Kafka nightmare - it's the last communist country!","I'm an actor. And it is, for me, an opportunity to meet people. One of the advantages of my profession is I come into contact with many people.","My only model for being a father was my father, an illiterate on the margin of society.","The wine I produce is not for keeping. It's the wine you want when meeting friends for a game of cards.","I don't care about Hollywood films. I'm not against Hollywood films, you know? Hollywood films were very good before, in the 1950s.","Hollywood exists only for the B-movies. The best things are coming from Europe.","I want to get more involved with the vineyards I have all over the world and to spend more time with the people who work in them.","I'd rather spend my time with grape growers than actors. In the film industry, all the money is focused on television and the stupidity of American cinema.","I love the police, contrary to many people.","I'd rather not have an address in France but an address in Italy because I love the country."],"Gerard Malanga":["I've always considered myself a poet in everything that I do, whether it's photography or movie-making.","When I started writing poetry in my senior term of high school - I was sixteen - I felt in touch with a secret language. It gave me a sense of identity. I suddenly discovered I wasn't alone.","All that I've done in my life thus far, all the poems and all the pictures, are not so much an intermingling of my life with art but a divine accident.","I seem to be always returning to photography in my poetry. I guess you could say that I'm documenting the personal history and relationship I have with photography.","I always had the feeling, even when I started, that my photography was meant to be archival in nature. Sort of like wine, I guess - they get better with age.","What does art mean to me? I never really think about the 'meaning' of art. Yet, obviously, that's what I do.","Whether it's a poem I'm working on or a picture I've snapped, it all has to do with the curiosity I feel without thinking about it.","If I'm astonished by what I've done, then I know I've been somewhere in the making of it but not during the making of it. Only after the fact. If I'm not astonished, then I've failed in the making of it.","The nature of photography has always resisted that temptation of interpretation. I look, and what I see looks back at me.","As a photographer, I don't really have a view of the world in general. Someone taking pictures for 'National Geographic' might. Each of us works to our full capacity when we're in the midst of a shoot. Each of us finds our own level of intensity, and that's the fun of it.","Whenever I do someone's portrait, I'm trying to locate the photo in the lens while reaching into that person psychologically. There's the magic! I don't always achieve it. It's a hit or a miss!","New York City has changed enormously. My gut impression of it now is that it's like being in a sci-fi novel: 'Blade Runner' syndrome. Nothing seems real anymore; everything is pre-packaged.","Be happy in what you do. Be respectful of yourself. Do good works for others, and the goodness will come back to you and make you a better person. I think that's what happiness is all about."],"Gerard Manley Hopkins":["What would the world be, once bereft Of wet and wildness? Let them be left, O let them be left, wildness and wet, Long live the weeds and the wildness yet.","Nothing is so beautiful as spring - when weeds, in wheels, shoot long and lovely and lush; Thrush's eggs look little low heavens, and thrush through the echoing timber does so rinse and wring the ear, it strikes like lightning to hear him sing.","By the by, if the English race had done nothing else, yet if they left the world the notion of a gentleman, they would have done a great service to mankind.","The poetical language of an age should be the current language heightened.","It is a happy thing that there is no royal road to poetry. The world should know by this time that one cannot reach Parnassus except by flying thither.","The effect of studying masterpieces is to make me admire and do otherwise.","Beauty is a relation, and the apprehension of it a comparison.","Do you know, a horrible thing has happened to me. I have begun to doubt Tennyson.","I always knew in my heart Walt Whitman's mind to be more like my own than any other man's living. As he is a very great scoundrel this is not a pleasant confession.","Religion, you know, enters very deep; in reality it is the deepest impression I have in speaking to people, that they are or that they are not of my religion."],"Gerard Way":["I'm not psycho... I just like psychotic things.","I want to be a vampire. They're the coolest monsters.","Suicide is a serious thing. And if you know anyone who is suicidal, you need to get them help. No one should be in pain. Everyone should love themselves.","Heroes are ordinary people who make themselves extraordinary.","Cigarettes and coffee: an alcoholic's best friend!","Remember the first time you went to a show and saw your favorite band. You wore their shirt, and sang every word. You didn't know anything about scene politics, haircuts, or what was cool. All you knew was that this music made you feel different from anyone you shared a locker with. Someone finally understood you. This is what music is about.","Life is very, very short, and you can choose to live it how you want. You can choose to dumb yourself down and not express yourself just so you can fit in, just so people won't dislike you.","Did Superman really want to save the world, or did he just feel like he had to? Would he much rather be a farmer? Maybe. Would he much rather be hanging out with his dad and his mom and his dog? Probably.","There's something very romantic about self-destruction and sabotaging your life, and taking a hammer to it.","I've always seen My Chemical Romance as the band that would have represented who me and my friends were in high school, and the band that we didn't have to represent us - the kids that wore black - back then.","What I like about The Sims is that I don't have a normal life at all, so I play this game where these people have these really boring, mundane lives. It's fun.","I feel like my mission is to be honest with myself. My mission is to share my truth - share, not give. I think that's what an artist is supposed to do: I think they share.","It is often my nature to be abstract, hidden in plain sight, or nowhere at all.","As free and crazy as we want to be, and how much we want to make the world a canvas, there's also a part of us that doesn't want to make any mark.","You should love yourself.","To me, the coolest, shiniest, sexiest, darkest, scariest thing you can be is pop.","There's not a lot of art forms where you can control your presentation and your ideas.","I thought 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' was so interesting the way it was made and the texture of it.","I'd rather be a creature of the night than an old dude.","The more people that learn about you, even if you're an underdog, then you can come under fire a lot and the more attention you get and the more threatening or dangerous you appear to people. And the more people try to knock you down.","My Chemical Romance is done. But it can never die.","So many people treat you like you're a kid so you might as well act like one and throw your television out of the hotel window.","There was a moment in my life when I really wanted to kill myself. And there was one other moment when I was close to that. But even in my most jaded times, I had some hope.","The clearest actions come from truth, not obligation.","It was harder to break into comics than it was to become a singer in a rock band.","To me, nothing feels more like being dead than being in your 20s and having no direction in your life.","I don't think having a My Chemical Romance action figure will make a kid start his own band, I like to think it will make him save children from a burning building.","People have evolved into something selfish, greedy and intolerant. People are unaccepting, because of religion, race, gender, sexual orientation... I've seen it in punk clubs, and I've seen it in the world.","You can't be two people in your brain, one rock dude and a dad - there's something in the middle of them, and that's really what you are and that's going to make you the best dad - not when you try to be one or the other.","I do enjoy manga but would not consider myself a 'super-fan,' only really connecting with certain works such as 'Lone Wolf and Cub,' or 'Tekkon Kinkreet,' the more breakthrough works, and 'Akira,' to me, is the daddy of them all.","I'm a big fan of domino masks, like Zorro, or Robin. You could put a domino mask on anything, and it becomes a superhero. You put a domino mask on a milkman, and he becomes, like, Super Milkman.","I understand that kids look up to me, that some people might have gotten sober because of me.","I love watching 'Twilight Zone.' New Year's Eve they do the marathon; I watch it every year.","I wasn't bullied in high school, I was just ignored.","When Scorsese shoots a violent scene, it's very uncomfortable - it's not like watching 'Rambo.'","My parents didn't have records, they didn't have radios, and they didn't listen to music. My grandmother was my main connection to art and music. She could play piano very well, and she had perfect pitch.","'Watchmen' is not only the greatest comic ever written, it's a really important work of fiction.","Alan Moore is a prophetic writer.","'The Black Parade' is an epic, theatrical, orchestral, big record that is also a concept album.","Most times with vanity projects, publishers don't believe in the work; they just believe in the name.","Comics are my first love, and I hate seeing an art form that I love suffer.","The only thing I learnt in high school is that people are very violent and territorial.","Freddie Mercury, to me, was probably the most important frontman to me growing up.","I love Alfonso Cuaron.","My favourite two festivals have always been the Big Day Out and Summersonic in Japan. The Big Day Out is a little more fun because it lasts longer. It's like an abbreviated version of the Warped tour because you get to play with the same people every day, which is really fun.","All of my favourite albums have this incredible amount of conceptual glue to them, even if they are not telling a story.","You put an old Misfits record on, and it sounds like it came out yesterday.","I wouldn't have been able to move to L.A. if I felt I was going to lose my identity as a New Jerseyian. My accent has gotten thicker since I've lived here.","My music is - I don't want to say my main focus, but it's what comes most naturally to me.","I've always had bizarre, negative feelings about anything traditional, like marriage and family. I never thought something like that worked.","My wife totally backs the way I am on stage; that's one of the amazing things about her. I have 120 per cent respect for her when I'm on stage, so there are definitely certain things I would never do.","I had a couple of really cool friends when I was a kid, and we'd find cool music and movies and show them to each other. My friend Dennis had a copy of 'A Clockwork Orange' and he'd already seen it once, and he was like, 'We need to watch this.' I was sleeping over his house - and I think we were literally 15 - and we watched it.","'Watchmen' is a politically charged story, and it explores exactly what a hero is, how the world would treat them and how they would react. It was the first time I read a superhero story that explored that situation. These are very real people with very real problems.","The thing about 'Watchmen' that people should know is that when it came out there was absolutely nothing like it. Up until then, comics were about the same thing: a guy in tights fighting another guy in tights and saving the girl - that was it.","A lot of kids get disappointed. They expect me to be, like, 'Bwaah.' 'If I spend a minute with them, they end up saying, 'Wow, you're a nice, normal guy.' They hate it when they catch me out of my makeup."],"Gerd von Rundstedt":["The responsibility of commanding the invasion fell to me, and the task was assigned to my Army Group.","It is madness to attempt to hold. In the first place the troops cannot do it and in the second place if they do not retreat they will be destroyed. I repeat that this order be rescinded or that you find someone else.","Another adverse factor was the way the Russians received continual reinforcements from their back areas, as they fell back. It seemed to us that as soon as one force was wiped out, the path was blocked by the arrival of a fresh force.","If was, increased by a lack of railways in Russia - for bringing up supplies to our advancing troops.","The German Air Force was not sufficient to protect the sea crossing on its own. While the leading part of the forces might have landed, there was the danger that they might be cut off from supplies and reinforcements."],"Gerhard Domagk":["Whatever contributes to the preservation of life is good; all that destroys life is evil.","The problem of chemotherapy of bacterial infections could be solved neither by the experimental medical research worker nor by the chemist alone, but only by the two together working in very close cooperation over many years.","We all remember how, at the beginning of the sulphonamide era, it was repeatedly observed that fresh cases of gonorrhoea in men responded best to sulphonamide treatment when suppuration had already occurred for several days, and not at the first appearance of the disease.","Why some gonococcal strains are more resistant than others is still not clear.","A rise in body temperature during sulphonamide treatment intensifies the biochemical reaction between drug and pathogen, while at the same time the heat itself injures the heat-sensitive gonococci."],"Gerhard Herzberg":["There is nothing wrong with good accounting, except that it does not necessarily lead to good science.","The citation for the 1971 Nobel Prize in Chemistry reads, 'for contribution to the knowledge of electronic structures and geometry of molecules, especially free radicals,' and therefore implies that the Prize has been awarded for a long series of studies extending practically over my whole scientific life.","Pursue science because it is knowledge, because it broadens our horizons. There is so much more to be discovered.","It is very difficult to find appropriate words to say 'thank you' for an honour like the Nobel Prize. It is the supreme honour that a scientist can receive. Some of the giants in physics and chemistry have received this prize.","If you start from nothing, it is very difficult to get anywhere.","The Glassco Commission was really not interested in good science. It was interested in good accounting.","Interest in the pseudo-sciences has become extraordinary.","Every newspaper feels it must have an astrology column, and even in the Carleton University bookstore this morning, I found books on astrology for sale.","Dealing with the health of people is more important than political considerations.","Many science people feel groups like WHO are there to do a job and not to be dealt with in a political way.","I was brought up as a physicist.","The CH radical is a very reactive radical which, under most conditions, has a very short lifetime.","The visible and near-ultraviolet emission spectrum of the CH radical has been known ever since spectra of an ordinary Bunsen burner have been taken.","For polyatomic free radicals and ions, one is dependent both for the ground states and the excited states on the study of electronic spectra to obtain the shapes and the geometrical parameters."],"Gerhard Richter":["I have no time for specialized concerns, working themes or variations that lead to mastery... I like the indefinite, the boundless; I like continual uncertainty. Other qualities may be more conducive to achievement, publicity, success; but they are all outworn - as outworn as ideologies, opinions, concepts and names for things.","Good art in general aspires to something, as a good painting aspires to something, almost spiritual or holy.","Weeks go by, and I don't paint until finally I can't stand it any longer. I get fed up. I almost don't want to talk about it, because I don't want to become self-conscious about it, but perhaps I create these little crises as a kind of a secret strategy to push myself.","Every museum is full of nice things. That's the opposite of before. It was important things or serious things. Now we have interesting things.","People won't stop painting, just as they won't stop making music or dancing. This is a facility we have. Children don't stop doing it or having it. On the other hand, it seems we don't need painting anymore. Culture is more interested in entertaining people.","Chance determines our lives in important ways.","Politicians are nauseating by definition... They can produce nothing, neither a loaf of bread nor a table nor a picture; and this inability to create value, this total inferiority, makes them jealous, vengeful, insolent and a menace to life and limb.","I do see myself as the heir to a vast, great, rich culture of painting - of art in general - which we have lost, but which places obligations on us.","We've lost these qualities, these abilities to do something by hand. Some illustrators have it still, but it's just not art. We have photography. We have cameras and computers that do it better and faster.","I'm still very sure that painting is one of the most basic human capacities, like dancing and singing, that make sense, that stay with us, as something human.","A father draws boundaries and calls a halt, whenever necessary. As I didn't have that, I was able to stay childishly naive that much longer - so I did what I liked, because there was nobody stopping me, even when I got it wrong.","It's our culture, Christian history, that's what formed me. Even as an atheist, I believe. We're just built that way.","I don't believe in God.","I have painted my family so frequently because they are the one who really affect me the most.","Gray is the color... the most important of all... absent of opinion, nothing, neither/nor.","I am ridiculously old-fashioned.","Art should be serious, not a joke. I don't like to laugh about art.","I believe in painting and I believe in eating too. What can we do? We have to eat, we have to paint, we have to live. Of course, there are different ways to survive. But it's my best option.","I don't dare to think my paintings are great. I can't understand the arrogance of someone saying, 'I have created a big, important work.'","I have always been structured. What has changed is the proportions. Now it is eight hours of paperwork and one of painting.","I go to the studio every day, but I don't paint every day. I love playing with my architectural models. I love making plans. I could spend my life arranging things.","Now that we do not have priests and philosophers any more, artists are the most important people in the world.","When I begin, theoretically and practically I can smear anything I want on the canvas. Then there's a condition I have to react to, by changing it or destroying it.","I don't think I can do this - painting under observation. It's the worst thing there is, worse than being in the hospital.","I can't paint as well as Vermeer.","Without form, communication stops... without form, you have everybody burbling on to themselves, whenever and however, things that no one else can understand and - rightly - no one else is interested in."],"Gerhard Schroder":["We want to change the way we help unemployed people find jobs. We want to be faster and more goal oriented.","As far as missile defense is concerned, a very thorough consultation process is underway.","I am not the German Tony Blair. Nor am I the German Bill Clinton. I am Gerhard Schroeder, chancellor of Germany, responsible for Germany. I don't want to be a copy of anyone.","I can't let important policy decisions hinge on the fact that an election is coming up every 90 days.","Next, we will create a modern immigration law.","We must take care that globalization does not become something people become afraid of.","This question about Iraq has gotten personal.","There's no conflict between the social-welfare state and open markets.","Germany is very free-trade oriented.","A market that's as open as possible is the precondition for a successful economy, and a successful economy is the precondition to being able to pay for social security.","We are seeing significant growth in foreign investment in Germany.","The question of feasibility, the question of cost, the question of including partners elsewhere in the world, the question of the effect of this project on arms agreements - all these issues are in discussion.","One effect could be that the huge atomic arsenal created in the cold war could be reduced significantly.","We made a decision that monetary policy will be made by an independent European Central Bank.","Any debate among politicians about monetary policy is counterproductive.","A common currency imposes on us a duty to cooperate more on policy.","Indeed, the creators of the euro envisioned it as an instrument to promote political union.","Whatever the details of union may be, there's no doubt we need more policy coordination in Europe.","Germany is in favor of integration precisely because we don't want dominance.","Naturally we are aware of the strength of our economy and naturally we don't want to downplay it.","We really believe our national interests are identical with European interests.","Any degree of unemployment worries me.","We want to encourage those who are able to work, no question.","If I correctly understand the goal of American policy, one wishes Russia to be a partner.","My impression is that American policy speaks not of antagonism but rather partnership.","As far as my relationship with President Putin is concerned, it's fine."],"Geri Halliwell":["My daughter is the biggest gift; I've said it so many times and it sounds like a cliche, but the thing about being a parent is when you think you've cracked it, and you're on top of your game, they change again and you have to catch up and adjust. I feel such a responsibility to instill good values in her, to be polite, to have discipline.","I love being on the beach - it's my favourite place. I can chill out, read, listen to music, play with my daughter.","There will always be a few people who just want to knock you down or are jealous or just want to be horrible for the sake of it. I don't know what drives someone to be nasty.","'Spice Girls' is about unifying the world - every age, every gender, everyone. It's woman power, it's an essence, a tribe.","The truth sets you free. It's a very liberating thing, when you say this is who I am warts and all and then you can just get on with life. It's amazing.","I am absolutely blessed and I'm very grateful for where I am today.","A lot of people have said that I've got a voice that speaks to children. I think I've got a natural naivety to me. I'm childish.","Being mean about other people isn't on my radar.","If people choose to engage on a one-dimensional level that's fine. But going beyond the surface can enrich ourselves as human beings.","I just feel that the only power I have is setting a good example.","I think it's unnecessary to be mean for the sake of being mean, but I do believe you have to be truthful, but with love.","Perfectionism kills art. I find that if I criticise myself, it spoils the fun. You can get paralysed by analysis - it takes all the playfulness away.","I have the most ridiculous TV crush on Michael McIntyre. I fell in love watching him on 'Britain's Got Talent'.","I don't know what I'm doing, but I'm damn well gonna do it!","Becoming a solo singer is like going from an eau de toilette to a perfume. It's much more intense.","Everyone has a mad half-hour once a month.","I have always wanted a solo career, deep in the darkest pit of myself, but I didn't dare admit it to myself even. It took me a long time to confront my fears.","I have been wearing black, which was a reaction to the Ginger thing. But now I have hopes and I can be anything. Tomorrow I might be naked with a feather boa, who knows?","I have got one of those faces that change every day: you can dress me up, make me look vampy and then make me look 12 years old. But don't all women do this thing? We all take on these roles.","I have never sung a whole song on my own before and I am not the best dancer in the world, but I would rather try and fall than not not try at all.","I know that I've overfed myself trying to prop myself up because I'm exhausted.","I want to communicate through my music. If you want to know Geri Halliwell listen to my album: it tells you more about me than a documentary ever could.","I won't mention the word tired. This is the 20th century and I can go around a little faster.","I'd never choose to turn the clock back.","I'm never getting too lonely because it's the kind of disease where you might sit in front of the TV with three bags of biscuits, rather than communicate with the world.","It's really important to remember that most people in the public eye are human for a start and a lot of things that you read in the media get slightly misconstrued and manipulated.","Obviously Victoria and Mel B have become mothers and there is a part of me that wants to be a mum.","Some people are naturally thin and some people are naturally heavier. It doesn't mean that bigger is healthier, or much thinner is healthier, it's on an individual basis.","Someone taught me how to eat properly. Learning from others is important when it's not working for yourself.","There's always going to be that pressure when you're in front of the camera. When you're famous it's just an extreme version of reality and there's a pressure to look a certain way.","We are obsessed with image. I don't think we should take it that seriously.","We're all just trying to fit in and find ourselves, particularly when we're growing up.","I've learnt that if I tell myself I'm not allowed something, I binge on it later. So if I want chocolate, I have chocolate. If I want biscuits, I have biscuits. I love cake. I just love cake.","Celebrity has some amazing advantages, of course it does. You're given an extraordinary power. It's a door-opener. I might not have to queue for things.","Being a celebrity, you can remain a child for ever, almost. You get away with more; you can get too pampered and it's not healthy.","I think I've really learned how important it is to empower women.","I'm so supported, and I'm so privileged. So many women today are single parents; I don't feel different. I think you get out of life what you put into it... and Bluebell was a beautiful accident. I feel blessed to have her. I'm learning every day as a mother.","I obviously want to give a healthy body image to my own daughter. I think having good examples, eating properly, that's all one can do - and just be really loving around her. I've tried to give her confidence in who she is. I think she's all right in the confidence department.","I've been all sorts of different shapes and sizes at different times in my life.","On the beach, we women are at our most exposed and therefore most vulnerable. As any woman deserves to look and feel good, especially when she's away on holiday, she needs swimwear that pays proper attention to comfort and function. And there should also be some thought put into value.","I was a late starter on the romantic front. I didn't start dating until I was in my 30s.","I've got an image of me at the bottom of my garden sitting under my silver birch tree reading, while everyone else had gone somewhere exotic.","For me, reading was always the great escape without getting your fingers burnt.","I love Australian people.","I'm done with trying to be perfect. A perfect body belongs to somebody else - and it's not me.","I have days of self-doubt, but I think the kindest thing I can do to myself is accept where my body is at.","I'm always coming up against scepticism in my life.","I do get scared, but I think - like it says in another book I've read - feel the fear and do it anyway. I try to have courage, pray a little bit and work through it. I'd rather try, even if I fail.","I was so afraid of upsetting people, and not being liked for saying something that was not to everyone's taste.","When I'm scared, my natural state is to hide and run for cover.","I like doing accents. One of my friends works in hotel reservations and I'll ring her up and complain about the suite. Sometimes I get her.","It is a blessing to have pretty people around me. I like people who are sparky, positive. Evil, dark people are repelled by me: 'Oooh no! Too much sunlight.'","I've always made my own clothes since I was a little girl. I was a terrible sewer, but I was always cutting and customising.","I'm much more accepting of myself. A lot of my body issues have naturally settled down.","I have a history of eating disorders but, as a mother, you think of being an example to your child. I'm so much more balanced than I was.","The thing is, when I feel like I have to lose weight, the opposite happens. I remember stuffing loads of chocolate on the plane to the shoot, and I thought, 'Why don't you have the courage to show up in a body that's natural, not overly worked out?'"],"Germaine Greer":["You're only young once, but you can be immature forever.","Man is jealous because of his amour propre; woman is jealous because of her lack of it.","Psychoanalysis is the confession without absolution.","The essence of pleasure is spontaneity.","Loneliness is never more cruel than when it is felt in close propinquity with someone who has ceased to communicate.","Women live lives of continual apology. They are born and raised to take the blame for other people's behavior. If they are treated without respect, they tell themselves that they have failed to earn respect. If their husbands do not fancy them, it is because they are unattractive.","The house wife is an unpaid employee in her husband's house in return for the security of being a permanent employee.","Yet if a woman never lets herself go, how will she ever know how far she might have got? If she never takes off her high-heeled shoes, how will she ever know how far she could walk or how fast she could run?","Women have very little idea of how much men hate them.","One may not reach the dawn save by the path of the night.","English culture is basically homosexual in the sense that the men only really care about other men.","Guilt is one side of a nasty triangle; the other two are shame and stigma. This grim coalition combines to inculpate women themselves of the crimes committed against them.","Revolution is the festival of the oppressed.","Marriage made more sense when it was indissoluble. It's the woman trying to cope with the strains of a one-parent family who will suffer most from the relaxation of the divorce laws.","Freud is the father of psychoanalysis. It had no mother.","Human beings have an inalienable right to invent themselves; when that right is pre-empted it is called brain-washing.","The management of fertility is one of the most important functions of adulthood.","It's absolutely philistine not to recognize what a great book 'An American Dream' is. Norman Mailer is his own worst enemy, and if you don't catch him in a defensive position, he'll admit it. I'd really like to help that man.","I have always been principally interested in men for sex. I've always thought any sane woman would be a lover of women because loving men is such a mess. I have always wished I'd fall in love with a woman. Damn.","If a person loves only one other person, and is indifferent to his fellow men, his love is not love but a symbiotic attachment, or an enlarged egotism.","The tragedy of machismo is that a man is never quite man enough.","Only one thing is certain: if pot is legalized, it won't be for our benefit but for the authorities. To have it legalized will also be to lose control of it.","I didn't fight to get women out from behind vacuum cleaners to get them onto the board of Hoover.","What we ought to see in the agonies of puberty is the result of the conditioning that maims the female personality in creating the feminine.","All societies on the verge of death are masculine. A society can survive with only one man; no society will survive a shortage of women.","Perhaps women have always been in closer contact with reality than men: it would seem to be the just recompense for being deprived of idealism.","Security is when everything is settled, when nothing can happen to you; security is the denial of life.","Women are reputed never to be disgusted. The sad fact is that they often are, but not with men; following the lead of men, they are most often disgusted with themselves.","Even crushed against his brother in the Tube the average Englishman pretends desperately that he is alone.","The surest guide to the correctness of the path that women take is joy in the struggle. Revolution is the festival of the oppressed.","The compelled mother loves her child as the caged bird sings. The song does not justify the cage nor the love the enforcement.","Rescuing women from their burden of unwarranted guilt is going to require 'educational practices and socializing agents' even more effective than the ones that have been relentlessly loading female humans with responsibility for other people's behavior from their earliest childhood.","Act quickly, think slowly.","Never advise anyone to go to war or to get married. Write down the advice of him who loves you, though you like it not at present. He that has no children brings them up well.","There is no such thing as security. There never has been.","Probably the only place where a man can feel really secure is in a maximum security prison, except for the imminent threat of release.","Evolution is what it is. The upper classes have always died out; it's one of the most charming things about them.","We in the West do not refrain from childbirth because we are concerned about the population explosion or because we feel we cannot afford children, but because we do not like children.","The sight of women talking together has always made men uneasy; nowadays it means rank subversion.","Freedom is fragile and must be protected. To sacrifice it, even as a temporary measure, is to betray it.","The principle of the brotherhood of man is narcissistic... for the grounds for that love have always been the assumption that we ought to realize that we are the same the whole world over.","Perhaps catastrophe is the natural human environment, and even though we spend a good deal of energy trying to get away from it, we are programmed for survival amid catastrophe.","I think that testosterone is a rare poison.","The real theater of the sex war is the domestic hearth.","Australia is a huge rest home, where no unwelcome news is ever wafted on to the pages of the worst newspapers in the world.","Developing the muscles of the soul demands no competitive spirit, no killer instinct, although it may erect pain barriers that the spiritual athlete must crash through.","Libraries are reservoirs of strength, grace and wit, reminders of order, calm and continuity, lakes of mental energy, neither warm nor cold, light nor dark.","It strikes me as very strange that whereas Tennyson could support most of Mr. Buckley's propositions about free trade, and the private sector, and private enterprise, Tennyson found no difficulty also in lending intellectual support to the idea of Women's Liberation.","Bras are a ludicrous invention; but if you make bralessness a rule, you're just subjecting yourself to yet another repression.","Supergroupies don't have to hang around hotel corridors. When you are one, as I have been, you get invited backstage.","Until women themselves reject stigma and refuse to feel shame for the way others treat them, they have no hope of achieving full human stature."],"Gero Miesenbock":["Sticking wires into the brain is obviously rather crude. It's hard to do in animals that run around, and there is a physical limit to the number of wires that can be inserted simultaneously.","As a general rule, biology tends to be conservative. It's rare that evolution 'invents' the same process several times.","For the longest time, neuroscientists were forced to be passive observers of brain activity.","I don't know about you, but I find it exhilarating to see how vague psychological notions evaporate and give rise to a physical, mechanistic understanding of the mind, even if it's the mind of the fly."],"Geronimo":["I was born on the prairies where the wind blew free and there was nothing to break the light of the sun. I was born where there were no enclosures.","I cannot think that we are useless or God would not have created us. There is one God looking down on us all. We are all the children of one God. The sun, the darkness, the winds are all listening to what we have to say.","I was no chief and never had been, but because I had been more deeply wronged than others, this honor was conferred upon me, and I resolved to prove worthy of the trust.","I was warmed by the sun, rocked by the winds and sheltered by the trees as other Indian babes. I was living peaceably when people began to speak bad of me. Now I can eat well, sleep well and be glad. I can go everywhere with a good feeling.","While living I want to live well.","The soldiers never explained to the government when an Indian was wronged, but reported the misdeeds of the Indians."],"Gerrit Smith":["We must continue to judge of slavery by what it is, and not by what you tell us it will, or may be.","Truth and mercy require the exertion - never the suppression, of man's noble rights and powers.","I do not subscribe to the doctrine that the people are the slaves and property of their government. I believe that government is for the use of the people, and not the people for the use of the government.","It is manifestly vital to the success of the anti-slavery cause, that the authority and influence of proslavery, especially of slaveholding, ministers should be destroyed.","When a good man lends himself to the advocacy of slavery, he must, at least for a time, feel himself to be any where but at home, amongst his new thoughts, doctrines, and modes of reasoning.","As this is the first time I have had the floor, it may be well for me now to confess, that I am in the habit of freely imputing errors to my fellow-men.","But as well may you, when urging a man up-hill with a heavy load upon his back, and with your lash also upon his back, tell him, that be has nothing to do either with the load or the lash.","But I love honesty, and, therefore; do I make great account of facts.","But, although America cannot be justly charged with violating the rights of Turkey, Turkey nevertheless can be justly charged with violating the rights of America.","God cannot approve of a system of servitude, in which the master is guilty of assuming absolute power - of assuming God's place and relation towards his fellow-men.","I am a plain man, and I care and know comparatively little about rhetoric.","I believe that government is for the use of the people, and not the people for the use of the government.","I do not object to the construction of rail roads and canals.","I need say no more, to prove that slavery is entirely unlike the servitude in the patriarchal families.","I prefer, in a word, the republican system, because it comes up more nearly to God's system.","I trust, that your readers will not construe my words to mean, that I would not have gone to a 3 o'clock in the morning session, for the sake of defeating the Nebraska bill.","I welcomed the organization of the Anti-slavery Society.","It is not to be disguised, that a war has broken out between the North and the South. - Political and commercial men are industriously striving to restore peace: but the peace, which they would effect, is superficial, false, and temporary.","It, sometimes, suits the slaveholders to claim, that their slavery is an exclusively State concern; and that the North has, therefore, nothing to do with it.","Let the poor man count as his enemy, and his worst enemy, every invader of the right of free discussion.","Let us tell our legislators in advance, that this is a right, restraints on which, we will not, cannot bear; and that every attempt to restrain it is a palpable wrong on God and man.","My rights all spring front an infinitely nobler source - from favor and grace of God.","Our concern, however, is with slavery as it is, and not with any theory of it.","Our political and constitutional rights, so called, are but the natural and inherent rights of man, asserted, carried out, and secured by modes of human contrivance.","The only ground on which a neutral State can claim respect at the hands of belligerents is, that, so far as she is concerned, their rights are protected.","The poor North has much to do with slavery. It staggers under its load and smarts under its lash.","The Southern slave would obey God in respect to marriage, and also to the reading and studying of His word. But this, as we have seen, is forbidden him.","There is one class of men, whom it especially behoves to be tenacious of the right of free discussion. I mean the poor.","There is room in our ranks for the old and decrepit, as well as the young and vigorous.","To no human charter am I indebted for my rights.","To say, that Capt. Ingraham violated the rights of Turkey, is nonsense.","True, permanent peace can never be restored, until slavery, the occasion of the war, has ceased."],"Gerry Adams":["If I didn't forgive the people who took me into the barracks and beat me unconscious over a period of days during the period when the British state was indicted for inhuman and degrading treatment in 1971-72, or even the guys who shot me, if you don't forgive them, you end up with unnecessary baggage.","The days of humiliation, of second-class citizens and of inequality are over and gone forever.","Hugging trees has a calming effect on me. I'm talking about enormous trees that will be there when we are all dead and gone. I've hugged trees in every part of this little island.","We have to make sure the Good Friday Agreement works.","In the past I have defended the right of the IRA to engage in armed struggle. I did so because there was no alternative for those who would not bend the knee, or turn a blind eye to oppression, or for those who wanted a national republic.","One man's transparency is another's humiliation.","Making peace, I have found, is much harder than making war.","For over 30 years, the IRA showed that the British government could not rule Ireland on its own terms.","The Good Friday Agreement and the basic rights and entitlements of citizens that are enshrined within it must be defended and actively promoted by London and Dublin.","At that time, the army leadership said the implementation of this agreement would allow everyone, including the IRA, to take its political objectives forward by peaceful and democratic means.","If you militarise a situation, you beg for an armed response.","But I also hold the very strong view that republicans need to lead by example.","But if republicans are to prevail, if the peace process is to be successfully concluded and Irish sovereignty and re-unification secured, then we have to set the agenda - no-one else is going to do that.","Republican patience with how unionism deals with the political institutions, and with key issues like equality and human rights, will be tested because, obviously, there will be a battle a day on these matters. So lets face up to all of this with our eyes wide open.","The catalyst for much of this change is the growing support for republicanism.","The unionists also for their part, want to minimise the potential for change, not only on the equality agenda but on the issues of sovereignty and ending the union.","I think there is a huge responsibility upon governments to understand the consequence of their decisions.","For good or ill, I'm a person of leadership. I do my best. I don't dodge responsibility.","In this context the British and Irish governments will have to promote a new, imaginative and dynamic alternative in which both governments will share power in the north.","It will always be a battle a day between those who want maximum change and those who want to maintain the status quo.","Sinn Fein has demonstrated the ability to play a leadership role as part of a popular movement towards peace, equality and justice.","Such decisions will be far reaching and difficult. But you never lacked courage in the past. Your courage is now needed for the future.","The Irish Republican Army has kept every commitment made by its leadership.","The way forward is by building political support for republican and democratic objectives across Ireland and by winning support for these goals internationally.","We are totally committed to ending partition and to creating the conditions for unity and independence.","When others stood idly by, you and your families gave your all, in defence of a risen people and in pursuit of Irish freedom and unity.","Your ability as republican volunteers, to rise to this challenge will mean that the two governments and others cannot easily hide from their obligations and their responsibility to resolve these problems.","Your determination, selflessness and courage have brought the freedom struggle towards its fulfilment.","Sinn Fein has the potential and capacity to become the vehicle for the attainment of republican objectives.","The last months, weeks and days have seen accelerating discussions, involving the DUP for the first time, about a comprehensive agreement which would see all outstanding matters dealt with and the Good Friday Agreement implemented in full.","Sinn Fein has productively taken the example of South Africa and, as we develop the peace process, we continue to use examples from South Africa.","You can only judge anything that happened in the times, in the times that that happened.","War... some people glamorise war and glorify war. It's not nice, from whatever point of view you come from.","We can be revisionist, and that's a good thing to be at times, but we shouldn't airbrush our history, so we can only make judgments in the objective conditions of that time.","I like to think I'm very grounded. I'm very grounded in my family. I'm very grounded in my community.","I stopped buying Sunday papers about 15 years ago, because you'd buy handfuls of them, and what you got, because the hard news comes from so many other channels, was opinion pieces. You're better off spending the money on a good novel.","When I wrote 'Before The Dawn,' I made it quite clear that there are lots of people involved in my life who I can't talk about simply because I'd put them at risk.","It's hard to think of a 16-month child being anything other than a delight to be around.","I think the worst kind of grief is unacknowledged grief."],"Gerry Anderson":["My dementia hasn't just affected me - it's affected my friends and family, too.","I'm a tomorrow's person. I don't collect memorabilia.","When we made 'Fireball XL5', I'd never heard of NBC, and I didn't even know what American networks were. I knew that it would be wonderful if the show was successful in America, but I knew nothing about the American networks.","There are some people in show business who are proud of the number of marriages they've had.","I've always been interested in the idea of space exploration. When I was younger it was just a dream, but the theory of rockets being able to travel through space was very much alive. I found it very exciting."],"Gerry Beckley":["Every decade has its ABBA; that's the proof that pop will always be around.","Also in Norah Jones, now there's a voice that sounds and I don't mean disrespect but sounds a hundred years old that sounds incredibly experienced. It's just an exciting time.","It's what everyone is after, I mean they want success and when they get it it's an incredible pressure but what you have to do is try to keep the big picture in view.","At the time, we thought it was a nice way to say something unique about the group to make us different from all the other bands kicking around in London.","I feel pretty confident in my own ability.","I know acts and I'm not going to name names but these people sold ten million copies the first time and the second album sells three million and it's considered a failure and they're dropped and that's really a shame.","I think if you're writing from the heart, very often, the subject matter will adjust as you age... but you try to write the best song you can possibly write. For us, we have the same basic elements that make up the America sound.","I try to be careful to not just say it's a greatest hits show because we've also made efforts to keep people up to date so to speak because we continually write and record and put out albums.","If anyone asks me about the George Martin years I usually say I group all of that stuff together as the single greatest experience but I wasn't scared I was just really looking forward to it.","It's not a bad problem to have because a lot of classic acts are known for one or two songs and in their show they basically hold those songs off until the end and you sit through an hour or so of lesser known material but in our case most of the songs are well known.","It's one thing to be a fan and it's another thing to be a label.","Our friends in the group Chicago, they just numbered theirs and we thought that was kind of neat but it made continuity from album to album and that was our way of doing it.","The first year with the success that we had and let me point out that the time frame changes depending on which decade you look at it. In the seventies acts were kind of expected to do an album a year. If you look at the Beatles they were doing three a year.","The reward is every night. The 90 minutes is such a payoff for us every night; it makes it all worth it to us. The fans who come to the shows know how much we enjoy this.","We then went through the audition process and picked a guy named Richard Campbell and he is no secret to L.A. players as he was with Natalie Cole for years and Three Dog Night.","For anybody who writes, very often, when you finish an album, you are so done with it. You've been listening in minutia, in super-focus.","The things I write are combinations of all of the people that have been influences to me.","I do know many a band out there, because believe me, we've played with most of them, who are together because they have to be. They might not talk to each other offstage, but they realize they can earn a living by going out and keeping that music alive.","When people say, 'Your music was the music of the Seventies,' I say, 'So was discoteque.' The Seventies was also the highest peak of heavy metal. Pick a genre - they were all alive."],"Gerry Cooney":["Am I complicated? Nah, I'm interesting. I just like having a good time.","Boxing gave me a voice to express the anger I felt for where I came from.","The past is yesterday. I'm looking forward to tomorrow.","I've had a long, long road with lots of ups and downs. But that's all behind me now.","I'm a real person. I have real feelings. I have real thoughts. It's a quality people like about me. They can reach out and touch me. I wouldn't give it up for anything.","You take that walk from the dressing room to the ring and that's when the real man comes out. Then you climb up those four stairs and into the ring. Then finally, you can't wait for the bell to ring.","I either had to concentrate on fighting, or I had to help my family. I chose my family. I love my mom; I love my family.","You have a small period of time when you can perfect your career and become good at it. A lot of guys get distracted, which only hurts them. You must stay focused and work very hard at boxing.","I grew up in a household where I learned five things from my old man. You know what they were? You're no good. You're a failure. You're not going to amount to anything. Don't trust nobody, and don't tell nobody your business. When I lost to Larry Holmes in 1982, I felt all five of those things smacked me right across the face.","I've spent most of my life in prison. I was a prisoner of my fear and my low self-esteem.","Drug abuse is a very difficult disease.","It takes a strong person to admit he's got problems. Things are bugging you, you've got to get it out. Life is supposed to be peaches and cream, but it doesn't turn out that way. I sometimes found things confusing and sometimes didn't understand how things can be so difficult.","My father never once told me he loved me. I told him I loved him only one time - that was when he was sick. It was hard, the way he showed his love. I didn't understand what he was trying to teach me. Now I know, but it came too late for him to see it. After he was gone, I realized he was trying to strengthen my mind to make me better.","All of the sports have a safety net, but boxing is the only sport that has none. So when the fighter is through, he is through. While he was fighting his management was very excited for him, but now that he is done, that management team is moving on.","When I get finished with fighting, I hope they ask the same questions. It's not my purpose to answer them. Boxing is the art of self-defense. I knock 'em out the first chance I get.","I've just had some bad luck. I've had every injury known to man. I understand how people think, 'How can this be happening all the time to Gerry Cooney?' But it did.","I'm a happy guy. I just want to see people laugh and smile.","I'm easygoing. There's a place and time for everything. When that bell rings, I'm not nice and easy. I'm not meek and passive.","You have got to not get hit. You could be the best puncher in the world, but if you're going to keep constantly taking punches you're going to lose your heart. Once you learn how to miss the punches and then you start to punch them, you become an all-around fighter.","I am involved in minor league baseball. I go around the country speaking to troubled youths, trying to help them understand that whatever path they choose, they'll need to really pay attention to it.","By the time you're 30 years old, you can be on a nowhere street, if you're not careful.","I grew up in a big Irish, Catholic family. My dad was a pretty rough guy. So one of my brothers left home when he was 15 and found his way to the gym. It gave me the opportunity to go and spend some time with him and work out in the gym.","I was a left hooker, and I loved hooking. I also really liked to jab and mix it up right away.","Muhammad Ali was the kind of guy you either loved or hated, but you wanted to see him. I happen to really love him. He brought boxing to another level and always made you laugh.","Roberto Duran was the kind of guy who was a true fighter and you hardly see guys like that anymore.","I was a small kid from Huntington, Long Island. I never imagined that anything like that would happen to me.","Growing up training, I use to get up so early I would wave to the garbage men going by. So, I had this relationship with Blue Collar America and I really liked it. I felt that lots of those people looked forward to me winning.","I am seeing all the guys, like Earnie Shavers, Tex Cobb, and Larry Holmes all the time.","Boxing was not the sport that I thought is was due to all the politics.","If you look at my career, towards the end you will see I was fighting like once a year. I was not part of the Don King top heavyweights, so I was kind of kept out. His guys were getting three to four fights a year and I could only get one.","The bad press came because they thought I should fight more. I couldn't get the fights because if I would sign to fight one of King's guys I would be signed to him. I chose not to do that. In hindsight, that might have been a mistake.","I lost three times in my career. Losing to Holmes I could deal with, because I lost to a true champion.","When that bell rang, I wanted to go out there and do my thing.","I feel very blessed.","When somebody used to compliment me, I'd spend 10 minutes trying to talk them out of it.","I always felt I was wounded. That I was no good, a piece of crap, and that I wouldn't amount to anything, because that's what my father always told me. I just felt like I didn't belong anywhere.","My father was one tough man.","I just like people. We have a good time together.","I had personal problems. I was spending 50% of my life on my family, 50% on boxing. Neither was getting anywhere. It was killing me. So I had to break away from fighting.","The road hasn't always been paved for me. People identify with that. Everybody passes through hard times, and I think that's part of my appeal - that I have, too.","People haven't seen enough of me. My fights haven't gone the distance, and people have a lot of questions. I want to find out for myself as much as the people do. I want to find out what I can do.","After every fight, I knock myself down. I start from scratch again. I say, 'I'm not as good as I thought.' It makes you work harder. It makes you push harder. It's more than money. It's more than the title. It's my pride, and it can be scary thinking about it. I could lose. It's scary.","I don't fear Holmes, but I think he's a good fighter. He has a lot of pride. But I wouldn't be fighting him if I feared him. It's going to be a tough fight. People say with all the hoopla out there, I won't be able to handle it. I believe the pressure's on him. I'm just going to do my thing.","Too many guys don't know what to do with their lives after boxing. I was lucky because I had two managers who didn't trust each other, and so they were always making sure where all the money was, and because of that, so did I.","I retired when I was 30, with all my marbles and a few bucks. But a lot of guys leave boxing penniless with no skills. Men in their 30s and early 40s, old for boxing, young in life, but also old in the job market if you're just getting started with no education. These guys need someone in their corner.","Too many fighters stay in the game for too long. They stay because it's awfully hard to walk away from the roar of the crowd. Really hard. You live for that and so you stay too long. And you might have a wife and kids to feed. So you keep fighting because you don't know how to do anything else.","We try to tell these guys that the end of a boxing career isn't the end of their lives: it's the beginning of a new one.","You gotta appreciate every day!","If I keep thinking about yesterday, tomorrow might never come.","I feel like a pro now. Before I fought Holmes, I felt like a rookie.","The fight with Holmes was a plus. I gained so much experience.","Just because you don't see someone doesn't mean the love has changed.","What hurt most were the people who came up to me and said they lost $1,000 on me. It just makes you mad.","It's like you always think that when you get to a goal, you'll be happy. But then there is always something else that interests you.","The Klitschko boys, they're great fighters, but they're just boring here in America.","I don't overswing any more. I can throw a punch and be right in position to punch again. No more 'Hail Mary' punches, where it took me five minutes to get back in position.","Winning the Gloves made me believe I was somebody.","Joe DeGuardia, I love that guy. He's not a superstar promoter yet, but he will be. He was a fighter himself; he's staying the course with these guys. He's developing some good fighters out there. I really applaud him whenever I get a chance to.","When we first started in Huntington Recreation with John Capobianco, we put four kids in the Golden Gloves finals. We didn't even have a ring. We trained at Stimson Junior High School. They give us the gym three nights a week. We used to box in the gym - no ring, just on the gym floor.","Long Island has a great boxing tradition.","I don't care what you say about me anymore! I don't care what you write about me anymore. I don't care! This is my life. I can't have anybody messing with my life. I just want to be Gerry Cooney, doing what I want to do. I want to be what I am. A fighter.","Sometimes it takes certain people longer to get over things than others.","I want to get me one of those titles.","People who think I lack desire are wrong.","Looking back, I couldn't get enough fights because Don King owned most of the top 10 fighters, and he never gave me a fight.","Everybody handles pressure differently.","I want to win. For myself first. And for all those people who stuck with me and understood.","When I fought Holmes, I feel I was a better fighter than he was. I was just so caught up in what was written about the fight - I got caught up in that whole thing.","I believe in my abilities as a fighter.","I really don't care who I fight.","My career got sidetracked after fighting Holmes.","In '82, I was a little too young, I was a little inexperienced, and I was more concerned with going the distance in the fight than going out and taking Holmes out.","I see Mike Tyson as too strong for Spinks.","For every athlete, the roar of the crowd goes away, and we have to learn how to turn the page.","I had money, but I still didn't know what to do with my life.","I believe in myself. I want to be a fighter. I want to be heavyweight champion of the world.","I was lucky. I held on to some of my money. I didn't really know what I wanted to do after boxing. But I found what I wanted to do.","It's great playing a sport where you don't get hit in the head.","Boxing was a way to express my anger. All of a sudden, I was expressing anger, and I was good at it. I was like a Jekyll and Hyde. Boxing helped me because I was fighting the anger out. I was knocking guys out.","If my son wants a boxing career, I won't stop him, but I definitely won't push him. It's bad for a kid to be pressured.","I have this want-to-be-liked thing, but deep down, I had this rage. I was just - I was blinded. I wasn't healthy enough to be able to learn more. I had one mode - to fight.","I liked to watch the expression in the fighter's face change when you connected with him. You know when you connect in the right spot. It's like a tunnel vision.","I have a great life. I'm the happiest guy in the world.","When I was 15, I decided to take up the sport seriously, so I went down to the Y.M.C.A. My first day there, this little Italian guy beat my brains out. I decided to quit. Then I realized I really wanted to be a fighter. I worked at it, went back, and that little Italian guy didn't beat me up no more.","Fighting is not something you can just turn off.","Maybe I'll go to acting school. Acting is like boxing, you know.","Every Saturday and Sunday, when the other guys were out having a good time at the mall, I was at home working in the garden.","When I hurt Norton, I got scared. I looked to the referee. But in the same sense, you're a fighter: you gotta have the killer instinct.","I'm one crazy, crazy guy.","I don't want anybody guarding me. I want to be free; I want to be left alone... I would like to go out there and have no one know me, but at the same time, it would bother me, y'know.","I was embarrassing against Spinks.","You go through pain. You feel uncomfortable, uncomfortable, uncomfortable until you change. I acquired a different outlook.","It took me to be 33 to start to know how to fight.","I spent a lot of time dwelling on yesterday, and it did me no good.","Some have made boxing a terrible thing to be around.","They said if I'd fight a ranked contender, I'd get a title shot. I did that, and the next day they changed the rules.","I think I make people laugh, and that's good in life.","Some of the things written about me hurt, but there is nothing I can do about it.","I've always wanted to fight. I love to fight.","I don't care about the critics. I took a lot of nonsense. I got stuck with silly labels like 'White Hope.' What about other guys like Tex Cobb - they never had those labels?","Sometimes you get so frustrated that things aren't working out, you say, 'Let me step away for a while.' But the fire still burns.","I know I can fight; that's the only thing that matters to me.","I have a Roman nose. It roams all over my face.","I saw my brother have an altercation one time. He hit a guy with a left hook to the body and a right hand to the chin. He not only knocked the guy out, but out of wind. That stuck with me. It scared me.","I had two managers who couldn't stand each other. I had a promoter, Don King, who couldn't get any fights, and I was fighting once a year. I knocked out Norton and then didn't fight for 13 months. Then I fight the heavyweight champion of the world.","It's like I had two things pulling at me: you want to be a fighter, and you have problems. So I couldn't be a fighter, and I wasn't solving any problems.","It's tough waking up in the morning and reading derogatory stories about you.","I always had the hope that Holmes and I would fight again.","I never fought because of my father. I started to box before he pushed me. It had nothing to do with him.","My father would never have lost to Holmes.","You can have more than one career, but you only have one family.","When I see a fighter gets into the ring, I not only see the fighter, but I see his wife and children. I care about what happens to them. I care about what happens to that fighter after he gets out of the ring.","About 99 percent of fighters end up broke. F.I.S.T. helps them turn the page and find new goals.","Most fighters, when they're finished, boxing turns its back on them.","When you bottom out, you have to stand up and get going again.","Anytime somebody climbs up those steps into the ring, they have a heart.","I learned a lot from the Holmes fight. I learned about styles and the pressure. I'm more prepared now."],"Gerry Harvey":["The political system is broke. It doesn't matter who the leader is if you are frozen in time and your hands are tied. Social media is so strong that minority groups get a huge say.","If you do genuinely care about people and love them a little, eventually you all have this common goal about where you want to go. They see it, and they believe it, and they become believers with you, and you can achieve wonderful things.","Importantly, I still give money to homeless people - and all other charities.","Kids go to school; we develop them at school. We develop them later on in the workplace so that we get better quality individuals, so that we get less people that are dependent or get into problems.","What I think is that we should be helping people so they can reach an even greater potential.","I would think that most of the online business will be conducted by traditional retailers and that over 90 per cent of the e-retailers will, in fact, all go out of business.","That's not in my nature to run away - I'll stand up and fight.","I've given away tens of millions of dollars over the years - probably to almost every charity in Australia.","I was talking to Rupert Murdoch the other day at a lunch, and he said, 'Maybe I'll live to 100'. He actually thinks he will live to 100!","If you are a manufacturer, an Internet company doesn't suit you. An Internet company does not display your product; it can't upsell. But we do a better job than any of the opposition.","There are plenty of people smarter than you by a long way. I just got lucky.","There is no Internet business in furniture or bedding. Zero - practically in the world.","You could go out and give a million dollars to a charity tomorrow to help the homeless. You could argue that it is just wasted. They are not putting anything back into the community.","I still have a fear about going broke. I always think about it.","At the end of the day, the more quality individuals you develop in the community, the better off the community should be.","Society might have been better off without them, but we are supposed to look after the disadvantaged, and so we do it. But it doesn't help the society.","People don't just come to work to make money; they need satisfaction.","I try to develop others. I get a great deal of joy out of helping people who, over the years, I've spent a lot of time mentoring - and just trying to get them to another level.","You get that air of satisfaction from achievement. It makes you feel good. We are only here for a very short time, and so you're crazy if you don't go out and try to milk it to the greatest extent you can.","I believe you should help people.","I had a trial run with Norman Ross for 21 years, from '61 to '82. I didn't have it in mind to open a chain like Harvey Norman. I opened one shop, but then the next thing you know, I've got another shop and then another shop.","I think the main thing you measure your success by is what you do in comparison to your opposition. If you're in an industry where you're the leader, then you're performing very well.","I'm probably not your typical business person in many ways. I don't wear a suit. I don't carry a briefcase. I don't wear a tie. I'm fairly casual. I haven't got a big office, and it's in a very ordinary part of town. I'd much prefer to downplay than impress.","I get a lot of comments from people that I'm just an ordinary bloke. They immediately feel they have a closer relationship with you; they relate to you.","For me, anyone who is over 80, I generally sit down and have a chat to because he is over 80, and he is going OK.","The people I know who have retired, so many of them lose interest and die; they just become nobodies overnight.","All I can say to you, if you look after your health, eat the right stuff, do enough exercise, keep your mind active, you might be around when you're 100 having this conversation with someone.","I'm hoping there'll be, if not a boom, then a big pick-up in housing because if that happens, then it will employ a lot of people, and the domino effect will go through the community, and it will help everyone.","I know people like myself where we've got resorts, or we're in the hospitality business, and we just can't make money because you're paying someone minimum $42 per hour or something on a Sunday.","You've got to open on a Sunday, but at the end of the day, you've just lost a lot of money by opening on the Sunday, so it's very, very difficult to make money when you're paying unskilled people $42 per hour.","As a retailer, we want everyone out there to earn more money, but then if you're running a business, and we can't make money because the wages are too high, that's a problem.","The internet thing is what I have the greatest problem with. I don't know if anyone in the media gets the internet thing and Harvey Norman. I think they have some strange interpretation of it that bears no resemblance to what actually happens.","Even if you sell the same number of plasma televisions - if you are selling them for 20 or 30 or 40 per cent of the original price, your revenue goes down, and the profit goes with it.","People are out there saying we have to devalue our properties because of the Internet, but it hasn't even come into play!","I am a commonsense sort of a person, and I don't get carried away with emotion and fears.","I'll be amazed in my lifetime if my business gets to being 5 per cent online.","Some analysts think people come into our shops and then go and buy the product on the Internet, but the manufacturer knows if the customer can't see the product and assess it, they won't buy.","Making decisions quickly isn't for everyone, and I've had my disasters, but overall, it works for me.","The cost to do business in Australia is higher, and the lack of scale is a part of that - Australia is a very small market compared to the U.S.","If I think something is right, I'll fight for it - always have. If it's wrong or I've been proved wrong, I'll walk away, and I'll apologise.","If a company in Australia has to pay tax and the other one doesn't, of course it's a disadvantage.","Everybody, be they female, whatever your religion, whatever your nationality, you're an individual, and if you perform well, we want you, and if you don't, we don't.","We're good at what we do because we're a family - this is in our bloody DNA; this is what we do.","We're supposed to be an entrepreneurial company; we're meant to be expanding and looking for opportunities - but the minute you do it, you get your head bashed in.","I'm a great believer in governments doing as little as possible and people power doing the rest, so I'm in favour of governments being there to govern in the areas that need governing, not a whole heap of other things that they stick their sticky fingers into."],"Gerry Mulligan":["I've appeared on some other people's albums.","The baritone can serve functions that the alto and tenor cannot, in orchestral voicing.","I like what I hear other guys doing, but the thing that really attracts me is melodic playing.","You can make a saxophone into an electric organ; you can do everything with it.","In a way, I started out to be a baritone player.","So I played alto for quite a while until I saved up the money for the baritone.","Then, of course, I played alto and tenor, wherever there were jobs.","The other saxophones, except as solo instruments, really don't have much point in the orchestra.","Only the French, I guess, really use tenor and alto to any great extent in the orchestra.","Now, the instrumentation in the jazz band and the jazz dance band has gone through many evolutions. For instance, in the 'twenties the tradition was two or three saxophones.","When I began listening to saxophones, I was first attracted to Coleman Hawkins.","In fact, I heard Bird first, and had got well into listening to him. You know, it's the kind of accidental thing that awareness of a player is: what's available, what somebody happens to play for you.","Miles Davis is one who writes songs when he plays.","Because if you've got the wit, you can make anything into a melody, ultimately.","People talk about innovations and evolutions and that kind of thing; I don't understand about that nonsense. It's like, all instruments are there to use all the time.","I've always wanted a C trumpet on top, to have that same kind of facility without shouting.","Eliminating the piano means that I've always worked closer with the bass than most players.","If you've only got one horn playing, I still want the sense of ensemble.","People are approaching electronic levels in music; although not all of it happens to tickle my fancy.","I'm fascinated with the electronic devices that we can mess around with.","New York is still where I live most of the time.","Actually, it is a fact that I've been doing more writing than playing in recent years.","This life of being a transient human being has gotten to a point when it's very hard to bear.","The first reason for starting to do the symphony concerts was to play this new piece of mine.","When we've finished the current tour I'm going to go back to Italy and see if I can do some more writing.","It's true I've always been attracted to the jazz band in an orchestral way, rather than a band way.","The recording industry has changed; they're enjoying such incredible success in the pop field.","You start way down on a low B flat on the tuba and you have a chromatic scale; you can match the colours all the way up, till you get to the top of the trumpet.","The Russian composers, especially, tricked the symphony orchestra into the kind of dynamic, rhythmic thing."],"Gerry Rafferty":["The important thing for any young singer or musician is to keep focused on becoming a better musician as opposed to becoming a bigger celebrity.","There have been periods in my life where I have experienced depression. It has been through some of my darkest moments that I have written some of my best songs. For me, singing and writing is very therapeutic. It's much more effective than taking Prozac!","In life, everything just happens, and I believe even before we are born that our role in life has already been determined. My main ambition is to continue to write music, which helps me to evolve in a spiritual sense and hopefully to inspire others.","I've never worried about how a new release will be received. I simply try to do the best I can and leave the rest to the gods. The music industry in those terms is something I loathe and detest. It conjures up images of a gigantic factory spewing out parts of the machine."],"Gerry Schwartz":["Good decisions can have bad short-term outcomes but be great for the business long-term.","I have said many times that it's a mistake to bet against the long-term health of the U.S. equity markets because it's a mistake to bet against the long-term health of the U.S. economy.","I have almost no interest in quarterly reports. Running a business or investing in a business based on quarterly earnings doesn't make any sense at all to me.","A lot of what I do is running businesses rather than buying stocks. My worst decision is probably when I know I have the wrong chief executive running the business, and I keep on waiting to make the difficult decision of replacing him.","Helping people getting a great start in life, a great foundation, is an investment.","I was a kid from Winnipeg - I didn't know anything about the world.","I came from Winnipeg and a small-town background, and I wouldn't say a depressed area, but Winnipeg has never been a rich area like Toronto.","You see these young people in Antigonish who are coming from Cape Breton, and these are really smart, attractive young people, who are living in a place that's been very rough economically. It's a very special thing to be helpful there.","I'd always felt like a Canadian living in the U.S.","I love the U.S. I love doing business there.","Private equity does pay very well, and my counterparts, guys that I grew up with who are still working at a number of firms, all make a lot of money.","In an undergraduate business environment, the best learning experience is the interaction students have with each other. They need to learn from each other as much as from professors and lectures and other teaching tools.","I am personally interested in more than just business schools. However, life has been good to me, and it's been good to me through a business career. I think the chance to help strengthen the foundation of young people going into business, as I did, just appeals to me.","Interestingly, a good undergraduate program does a lot of what an MBA does. I think a really good undergraduate program and some work experience is just about the equal of an MBA.","Just looking at Onex: We hire almost entirely at the most bottom level and bring them through a nine-year training program. We're probably 70/30 today not requiring an MBA."],"Gerry Spence":["What the insurance companies have done is to reverse the business so that the public at large insures the insurance companies.","Is there anyone I wouldn't take as a client?

Elion":["I think it's a very valuable thing for a doctor to learn how to do research, to learn how to approach research, something there isn't time to teach them in medical school. They don't really learn how to approach a problem, and yet diagnosis is a problem; and I think that year spent in research is extremely valuable to them.","Nobody... took me seriously. They wondered why in the world I wanted to be a chemist when no women were doing that. The world was not waiting for me.","I was born in New York City on a cold January night when the water pipes in our apartment froze and burst. Fortunately, my mother was in the hospital rather than at home at the time.","I loved to learn everything, everything in sight, and I was never satisfied that I knew everything there was to know in each of my courses.","Over the years, my work became both my vocation and avocation. Since I enjoyed it so much, I never felt a great need to go outside for relaxation. Nevertheless, I became an avid photographer and traveler. Possibly my love for travel stems from the early years when my family seldom went away on vacation.","My father emigrated from Lithuania to the United States at the age of 12. He received his higher education in New York City and graduated in 1914 from the New York University School of Dentistry. My mother came at the age of 14 from a part of Russia which, after the war, became Poland; she was only 19 when she was married to my father.","I was a child with an insatiable thirst for knowledge and remember enjoying all of my courses almost equally. When it came time at the end of my high school career to choose a major in which to specialize, I was in a quandary.","Although I never married, my brother fortunately did, and I have had the pleasure of watching his three sons and daughter grow up. Several of them now have children of their own. We have been a close-knit family, although often separated by distance, and have shared each other's happiness, sorrows, and aspirations.","I had no specific bent toward science until my grandfather died of cancer. I decided nobody should suffer that much."],"Gertrude Ederle":["I was happiest between the waves.","The doctors told me my hearing would get worse if I continued swimming, but I loved the water so much, I just couldn't stop.","To me, the sea is like a person - like a child that I've known a long time. It sounds crazy, I know, but when I swim in the sea, I talk to it. I never feel alone when I'm out there.","God has been good to me.","I am not a person who reaches for the moon as long as I have the stars.","Oh, I eat whatever I want whenever I want it.","Of course one can't eat in a civilized fashion while touring in theatres.

It teaches patience and careful watchfulness; it teaches industry and thrift; above all it teaches entire trust.","The love of gardening is a seed once sown that never dies.","It is no use asking me or anyone else how to dig... Better to go and watch a man digging, and then take a spade and try to do it.","The lesson I have thoroughly learnt, and wish to pass on to others, is to know the enduring happiness that the love of a garden gives.","In garden arrangement, as in all other kinds of decorative work, one has not only to acquire a knowledge of what to do, but also to gain some wisdom in perceiving what it is well to let alone.","There is a lovable quality about the actual tools. One feels so kindly to the thing that enables the hand to obey the brain. Moreover, one feels a good deal of respect for it; without it the brain and the hand would be helpless.","There is no spot of ground, however arid, bare or ugly, that cannot be tamed into such a state as may give an impression of beauty and delight."],"Gertrude Stein":["Everybody gets so much information all day long that they lose their common sense.","There ain't no answer.

I had my own opinion about things and knew how to insist on this.","We were young, we were pilots, and we were hungry to test the new technology of 'space machines.'

But when you're a teenager, you're fearless because you don't know the repercussions to anything.","I enjoy fashion photography and textiles, that whole aspect of it. As more of an art form, I like Proenza Schouler. Those guys are really cool because they seem to have an interesting approach to it all.","I like the pharmacy makeup. I always get stuck in that aisle... I've always liked looking at it.","Movies are a collaboration, I feel, so I didn't think of myself as an authoritative figure as much.","When I was a baby, my mom was always bringing me onto set.","I wanted to be a ballet dancer. I was bad - I'm not very coordinated. But I always wished I could have been a dancer.","I didn't go to film school. My Grampa always says just watch a lot of movies. He didn't go to film school; he went to theatre school. It's interesting to learn about the technical side of it, but I think it's more important to learn about writing and working with actors.","I think when you do things outside of what you're interested in, you meet people and get ideas to bring in to whatever it is you love doing the most.","I guess I knew my dad was into photography, so a part of me was interested in picking it up to understand him a little better.","I've always been very comfortable in a set environment.

It just smells clean.","I'm Italian, so I need to get someone to wax my eyebrows, but I'm not so good at keeping it up.","I studied photography at Bard, but I just felt tired of it.

I love David Fincher, I love Alexander Payne and Jane Campion and my aunt. Spike Jonze. There are just so many amazing directors.","We definitely have to support other female directors because there's not enough of us.","I think what's so great about making your first feature film is that you're so naive in some ways; you don't know what to expect, and you don't question things as much because you're just trying to figure it out as you go.","I really learned a lot when I worked on my grandpa's film 'Twixt' and got to be with him start to finish and sit next to him every day. That was my film school.","So many of the kids on television have really nice clothes, perfect skin and hair.","I went to a private school, and I struggled academically.

But it's really a mix between fantasy and laziness.","If I'm not comfortable, I just look awkward.","With my aunt, I definitely can relate to how she makes a movie because she does it with her own demeanor, which isn't this loud presence.","I love making movies. But it's a lot of investing your heart and soul. It can be exhausting.","I enjoy seeing how my friends - Proenza Schouler, Zac Posen, Rodarte - use clothes to create their vision and art.","Costumes say a lot about a character. When it came to 'Palo Alto,' it was important for me that the kids didn't look perfect. In most teen movies today, all of the clothes are expensive. I remember wearing a lot of dirty vintage clothes.","I watched a lot of movies about teenagers, including 'The Last Picture Show,' 'American Graffiti,' 'Rumblefish.' It's one of my favorite genres.","The teenage years are such a great subject because everything is heightened and on the surface, and it deals with universal emotions that we face even as we get older.","I think there's always this idea in your head, but you have to allow the film to take its own course.","Making a movie is a lot of problem solving.","I just remember that pivotal moment when you're a young adult, and you realize that these authority figures are human beings, too, and they're figuring out their lives just as you are, and they're flawed.","I love to play with the gadgets that come with film.","I don't like being in front of the camera.","I've only ever taken a playwriting class, but I like creative writing and writing screenplays.","Usually when I get nervous and don't know how to prepare for something, I just don't do anything at all, which is not necessarily the best idea.","I'm not so vocal. I try to get loud, but my voice will just crack or something.","I remember having crushes and longings, but there were all these missed opportunities or things that seemed like such a big deal, but you really don't understand what the other person is going through.","When I went to college, my mum was really sad, so she preserved my bedroom, like a weird time capsule.","'Virgin Suicides' was such a big movie to me as a teenage girl. It blew me away.","I was really nervous working with actors, since I come from a photography background.","It's hard for me to articulate myself.","It's tricky to take a book of short stories and turn it into a feature film.","Visually, I love the setting of suburbia.","My grandpa showed me how to build stamina onset behind the scenes on 'Twixt.'","I'm so proud to be American.","I went to a private all-girls school where I didn't feel I fit in.","My name does help me get in the door, but it doesn't do the work for me.","As a first-time director, you act a lot like a teenager. I made decisions because I was hotheaded. My skin broke out. I was trying to understand who I am.","I knew I wanted to be creative but didn't know how.","I want to learn and challenge myself and grow.","I never particularly liked it in New York City.","Working with a great actor is really educational.","There is always something I gain from watching a movie, whether it's a silly romantic comedy or an art film.","I have so much appreciation for movies because I understand how hard it is to make one.","Women need to support women.","I just love seeing other females work.","I was always a big James Franco fan.","It's hard not to be impressed by my older relatives.","My family get so mad at me when they come over.

I'm bad at eating healthy; I usually just run across the street and get cheeseburgers.","My only vice is 'Keeping up With The Kardashians.' I can't really explain what it is that fascinates me so much, but it just sucks me in.","In high school, I didn't always relate to my friends. I was more of a spectator.","I think my job is hopefully to connect with people emotionally and to feel less alone or understand things in a certain way.","Anyone can create and put stuff out there, so then as viewers and listeners, we have access to a lot of different unique view points.","I get to collaborate and tell stories with moving photographs.","If I were to save one possession in a fire, it would have to be my dad's camera, an old, broken Nikon. I always keep it with me - his personal things mean a lot.","I feel like I can communicate much better using images than words.","Once I found these sticker things for your nails - Sally Hansen - those were really fun to do. They're really fun to do when you're bored, and it's better than painting your nails because you don't mess up. It looks really good, very professional. I tried a zebra one that was really pretty, but I always get a little bored of it.","I've been going to the same person for haircuts since I was thirteen.","I remember people - not my family - always asking, 'Oh, so are you going to make movies when you're older?' I felt pressured, and that always kind of deterred me.","I got my GED my senior year and ended up taking community college classes before I transferred to Bard.","It was kind of intimidating to make a feature without that much experience.","The hardest thing on 'Palo Alto' was letting go because I kept working on it, trying to make it better.","Most movies use older actors, but I thought, if I could just put kids on camera and get them to be themselves, what could be easier?","You can't host an Italian film festival without Marcello Mastroianni. It just doesn't feel right.","I'm always really impressed when a movie can function like a novel does - that's so hard to do.","In Italy, there are a lot of Coppolas - it's like being called Jones. No one really notices.","I love my family's films.","Friends would ask, 'Have you seen 'The Godfather?' and I'd be like, 'No.'","In California, where you're allowed to drive at 16, you get so much freedom with that.

I love exploding things.","I've been very surprised by people asking me what my teenage experience was like."],"Giacomo Casanova":["Love is three quarters curiosity.","Real love is the love that sometimes arises after sensual pleasure: if it does, it is immortal; the other kind inevitably goes stale, for it lies in mere fantasy.","It is only necessary to have courage, for strength without self-confidence is useless.","By recollecting the pleasures I have had formerly, I renew them, I enjoy them a second time, while I laugh at the remembrance of troubles now past, and which I no longer feel.","Man is free; yet we must not suppose that he is at liberty to do everything he pleases, for he becomes a slave the moment he allows his actions to be ruled by passion.","Worthy or not, my life is my subject, and my subject is my life.","The reader of these Memoirs will discover that I never had any fixed aim before my eyes, and that my system, if it can be called a system, has been to glide away unconcernedly on the stream of life, trusting to the wind wherever it led.","My errors will point to thinking men the various roads, and will teach them the great art of treading on the brink of the precipice without falling into it.","I learned very early that our health is always impaired by some excess either of food or abstinence, and I never had any physician except myself.","I have had friends who have acted kindly towards me, and it has been my good fortune to have it in my power to give them substantial proofs of my gratitude.","I have always loved truth so passionately that I have often resorted to lying as a way of introducing it into the minds which were ignorant of its charms.","I will begin with this confession: whatever I have done in the course of my life, whether it be good or evil, has been done freely; I am a free agent.","Hatred, in the course of time, kills the unhappy wretch who delights in nursing it in his bosom.","We avenge intellect when we dupe a fool, and it is a victory not to be despised for a fool is covered with steel and it is often very hard to find his vulnerable part.","You will be amused when you see that I have more than once deceived without the slightest qualm of conscience, both knaves and fools.","In fact, to gull a fool seems to me an exploit worthy of a witty man.","I know that I have lived because I have felt, and, feeling giving me the knowledge of my existence, I know likewise that I shall exist no more when I shall have ceased to feel.","I have felt in my very blood, ever since I was born, a most unconquerable hatred towards the whole tribe of fools, and it arises from the fact that I feel myself a blockhead whenever I am in their company.","God ceases to be God only for those who can admit the possibility of His non-existence, and that conception is in itself the most severe punishment they can suffer.","I have met with some of them - very honest fellows, who, with all their stupidity, had a kind of intelligence and an upright good sense, which cannot be the characteristics of fools.","I don't conquer, I submit.","As to the deceit perpetrated upon women, let it pass, for, when love is in the way, men and women as a general rule dupe each other.","The man who has sufficient power over himself to wait until his nature has recovered its even balance is the truly wise man, but such beings are seldom met with.","I leave to others the decision as to the good or evil tendencies of my character, but such as it is it shines upon my countenance, and there it can easily be detected by any physiognomist.","I have often met with happiness after some imprudent step which ought to have brought ruin upon me, and although passing a vote of censure upon myself I would thank God for his mercy.","For my future I have no concern, and as a true philosopher, I never would have any, for I know not what it may be: as a Christian, on the other hand, faith must believe without discussion, and the stronger it is, the more it keeps silent.","I always made my food congenial to my constitution, and my health was always excellent.","The history of my life must begin by the earliest circumstance which my memory can evoke; it will therefore commence when I had attained the age of eight years and four months.","My success and my misfortunes, the bright and the dark days I have gone through, everything has proved to me that in this world, either physical or moral, good comes out of evil just as well as evil comes out of good.","Marriage is the tomb of love.","I am bound to add that the excess in too little has ever proved in me more dangerous than the excess in too much; the last may cause indigestion, but the first causes death.","In the mean time I worship God, laying every wrong action under an interdict which I endeavour to respect, and I loathe the wicked without doing them any injury.","God, great principle of all minor principles, God, who is Himself without a principle, could not conceive Himself, if, in order to do it, He required to know His own principle.","Heart and head are the constituent parts of character; temperament has almost nothing to do with it, and, therefore, character is dependent upon education, and is susceptible of being corrected and improved.","Should I perchance still feel after my death, I would no longer have any doubt, but I would most certainly give the lie to anyone asserting before me that I was dead.","The mind of a human being is formed only of comparisons made in order to examine analogies, and therefore cannot precede the existence of memory.","Thence, I suppose, my natural disposition to make fresh acquaintances, and to break with them so readily, although always for a good reason, and never through mere fickleness."],"Giacomo Leopardi":["Real misanthropes are not found in solitude, but in the world; since it is experience of life, and not philosophy, which produces real hatred of mankind.","Death is not evil, for it frees man from all ills and takes away his desires along with desire's rewards.","Old age is the supreme evil, for it deprives man of all pleasures while allowing his appetites to remain, and it brings with it every possible sorrow. Yet men fear death and desire old age.","People are ridiculous only when they try or seem to be that which they are not.","No one is so completely disenchanted with the world, or knows it so thoroughly, or is so utterly disgusted with it, that when it begins to smile upon him he does not become partially reconciled to it.","No human trait deserves less tolerance in everyday life, and gets less, than intolerance.","There are some centuries which - apart from everything else - in the art and other disciplines presume to remake everything because they know how to make nothing."],"Giacomo Meyerbeer":["Please accept a promise from me in his name that I will always live in the religion in which he died.","May God be with me! May Heaven bless this New Year. May it be a year of fruitfulness, of peace and prosperity; may it be a year of peace and unity for all mankind; may the world be freed of cholera.","Preserve my artistic creativity and ennoble my artistic fame."],"Giacomo Puccini":["Inspiration is an awakening, a quickening of all man's faculties, and it is manifested in all high artistic achievements.","Art is a kind of illness."],"Giada De Laurentiis":["Pasta doesn't make you fat. How much pasta you eat makes you fat.","The holidays stress people out so much. I suggest you keep it simple and try to have as much fun as you can.","Food brings people together on many different levels. It's nourishment of the soul and body; it's truly love.","I'm into very colorful food. Obviously lots of flavor, but I think we eat with our eyes first, so it has to look great. The presentation has to be great.","My family truly believes they are better cooks than I am. They see me as Giada, not as a celebrity chef. To them I'm just me - their granddaughter, niece, etc., and they're older and wiser. I like that because it keeps you grounded.","I count on chiropractic sessions to keep my body aligned. Standing for hours can impact my posture, and that can throw the rest of my body out of whack. Acupuncture helps me relax and release stress. I'm also very into massage to help release tension in my back, neck, and shoulders.","I'm actually a very shy person, which is why I always chose to be in the kitchen. You can make people happy and entertain them, without really being there. You can make a very short appearance and then say, 'I've got something on the stove, gotta go!'","Yoga has trimmed my body in a way that the gym never could. I used to be a gym rat, but I switched to yoga and am now almost 10 pounds lighter. One important thing I've gotten from yoga is breathing. When I'm cooking, the top part of my body collapses down. It cuts off my diaphragm.","My goal is to make Italian food clean and accessible and beautiful and tasty, with simple ingredients that people can find at a local grocery store, because people don't want to go to a gourmet shop in search of items that will sit in their pantry for years after they use just a teaspoon or pinch of them.","The summer before I went to culinary school, my family wanted me to take a job on a movie to make sure that I was making the right decision. I think they hoped I would change my mind about culinary school.","There's nothing like a home-cooked meal - nothing! When people ask me what the best restaurant in L.A. is, I say, 'Uh, my house.' It's more intimate. Food can connect people in a forever sort of way.","I have been blessed with a good, fun, and wonderful life, but I've also seen a whole lot of pain.","I think children learning to cook can be such a wonderful thing. It can help build confidence, make them feel good about themselves. It helped me build my ego and even start to get acceptance at school. I'd bring things to class that I'd cooked at home.","It helps immerse yourself in what you potentially want to do. Being involved, learning firsthand and observing the craft and absorbing all you can, makes it easier to define what you want. It will also ultimately make you a better Chef. Culinary school, or even a single class, is a great bet too.","My biggest bit of advice would be to spend some time actually helping caterers or Chefs, even if it has to be for free or as an intern of culinary externship. It helps immerse yourself in what you potentially want to do.","My grandfather's family used to own a pasta factory in Naples and they would go door-to-door selling their pasta. So his love of food came from his parents, which was then passed down to my mother and then again to me.","I grew up in the kitchen, mostly with my grandfather, my mother and my aunt Raffy.","I lost my brother when he was 30, and that was devastating for me. I don't know if I will ever get over it.","If people are made to feel uncomfortable in the kitchen, they won't go in there. That's why I think children learning to cook can be such a wonderful thing.","It's almost ingrained in people that, just like you can't be a smart model, you can't be a good-looking cook.","I'm most comfortable in T-shirts, but they have to have some style to them.","When I was a kid, for my birthday every year, my mother made me pasta bechamel, which is rigatoni with a white cream sauce.","My mother and I, our favorite part of any baked pasta is the top, where the cheese gets crusty.","Talking to other people while you're cooking, it doesn't come naturally.","I wasn't looking to get into TV. My family was in the movie business, so I was never interested in that world.","I think you can tell the food is close to my heart, too, because I'm doing what I do best.","I made lemon spaghetti in an early season of 'Everyday Italian,' and to this day people still come up to me and say they love it. It's very, very simple. Basically, you cook the pasta and mix together Parmesan cheese, olive oil, lemon juice and zest and pour it over the pasta.","Food was always a big part of my life. My grandfather was one of 14 kids, and his parents had a pasta factory, so as a kid, he and his siblings would sell pasta door to door. After he became a movie producer, he opened up De Laurentiis Food Stores - one in Los Angeles and one in New York.","Attitudes toward food have completely changed.","My grandfather gave me inspiration to cook, and love food and flavors. My Aunt Raffie, gave me creativity and the inspiration to create new things. My mother inspires me to find simplicity in food.","I was so nervous to turn 40, but the last year and a half has been the most fun I have ever had.","Everything in moderation.","Stock up your pantry and your freezer with things that aren't perishable: Your favorite jar of tomato sauce that lists 'tomato' as the first ingredient, lots of grains, olive oils, vinegars, tomato pastes, onions, shallots. When you go to the store, you only have to pick up meats and produce.","I spent time at my grandfather Dino's gourmet store where he brought in chefs from Naples to cook. I thought of them as rock stars.","Lidia Bastianich, sorry, but kind of boring. I mean, I love Lidia, but you can fall asleep watching her. And Mario Batali? I love Mario to death... but he's not romantic or sensual. Those are the things I bring to the table.","These days it's cool to be ethnic and to be different, but when I was a kid, it was not cool - at all. My friends would come over and my mom would make crepes with eggs, stuffed with mozzarella cheese, tomatoes and spinach. And they'd be like, 'What is this?'","I had a very tough childhood. I came here from Italy in the '70s and didn't speak a word of English, so the kids at school tormented me. Truly, it was horrifying the names they called me, and the teachers never really did a thing to stop it.","Pretty much every time I try something different or do something in front of a live audience, I truly think they might throw peanuts at me.","I think it can be hard for any man to sometimes be upstaged by his wife. So when I'm home, I work very hard to be Todd's wife and Jade's mother. I have no problem going back to those traditional roles. I try to be Giada, the young girl that he met 20 years ago and fell in love with.","All men want to be treated like kings in a relationship, and I think if women don't indulge that sometimes, their men are likely to stray and look for someone who can give that to them.","I write everything down. I e-mail the second I think of something, or I write notes in my BlackBerry calendar. I set up reminder alerts on my phone. And I have a notebook by my bedside so I can write down any last-minute ideas.","My sister is a masseuse, so we trade - she gives me massages and I give her prepared meals. It's a great system I'd recommend: Cook or babysit for a friend in exchange for one of her skills.","I eat a little bit of everything and not a lot of anything. Everything in moderation. I know that's really hard for people to understand, but I grew up in an Italian family where we didn't overdo anything. We ate pasta, yes, but not a lot of it.","I'm comfortable in my own skin. I know I'm not going to ever be Cindy Crawford or Elle MacPherson.","I keep my skin - especially on my face and neck - out of the sun. My brother died of melanoma eight years ago, and I've got SPF on all the time, 24-7. It makes you realize, the sun is a wonderful thing, but it can be a very devastating thing. So sunscreen is key, and a lot of laughter, too.","Cooking for me is a way to wind down. It's different from cooking on camera, where you have to do everything twice, for a wide shot and a close-up.","Every time I think I have something under control, it changes and I don't have it under control. I think it takes several years to get there. Jade is 19 months old, so right now I'm on alert all the time. And as a mom I think you're constantly worrying about things.","Don't expect too much from yourself. What I like to do when I have a day off is make various cookie doughs and freeze them. Then I always have that on hand if I need it.","To a billion people around the world surviving on just a dollar a day, the question of what to eat tonight is more about life and death than about recipes. The struggle of poor people around the globe weighs heavily on me, especially now that I am a mother, which is why I work with Oxfam."],"Giambattista Valli":["I like things that are kind of eclectic, when one thing doesn't go with another. That's why I love Rome. The town itself is that way. It's where Fascist architecture meets classic Renaissance, where the ancient bangs up against the contemporary. It has a touch of everything. That's my style, and that's what my work is about.","The hardest thing in fashion is not to be known for a logo, but to be known for a silhouette.","Rome holds my psyche in balance. Whenever I'm there, it's like a holiday.","I have made bouquets of pleats, bouquets of flowers, bouquets of ruffles, bouquets of feathers. Often I design in mousseline, held tightly around the waist, and with something else going on all around.","I don't shop. I buy things that inspire me, that give me emotion.","I want a woman to feel the cut of the scissors in the clothes.","Capucci was the biggest schooling I had. It wasn't just about the technical knowledge, such as color and volume, but also about the secret rules, and the beautiful codes of respect between the atelier and the master.","I'm a label that wants to sell. I believe in clothes.","At Ungaro, I discovered the flou and the language of Paris.","My clothes are for the international jet set. They are very much for the red carpet.","The problem is that resuscitating old labels doesn't work anymore. I think it is very important to give hope to a new generation of designers, so that one day they really can put their own names out there."],"Giambattista Vico":["Uniform ideas originating among entire peoples unknown to each other must have a common ground of truth.","Common sense is judgment without reflection, shared by an entire class, an entire nation, or the entire human race.","The universal principle of etymology in all languages: words are carried over from bodies and from the properties of bodies to express the things of the mind and spirit. The order of ideas must follow the order of things.","It is true that men themselves made this world of nations... but this world without doubt has issued from a mind often diverse, at times quite contrary, and always superior to the particular ends that men had proposed to themselves.","The nature of peoples is first crude, then severe, then benign, then delicate, finally dissolute."],"Gian Carlo Menotti":["A man only becomes wise when he begins to calculate the approximate depth of his ignorance.","Art is the unceasing effort to compete with the beauty of flowers - and never succeeding.","There are three reasons why I live in Scotland. First, I like silence, and you have to be a millionaire to buy silence in Italy. Second, I like cold weather. Third, in Italy I have too many relatives and know too many people, so I never get a quiet time.","I thought conceptual art was a joke.","Melody is a form of remembrance. It must have a quality of inevitability in our ears.","One lived in the impression that nobody could ever compete with the 'Nutcracker' or 'A Christmas Carol.'","Writing beautiful melodies is not fashionable because it is very difficult to do.","Waiting and hoping are the whole of life, and as soon as a dream is realized it is destroyed.","Any subject is good for opera if the composer feels it so intently he must sing it out.","Hell begins on the day when God grants us a clear vision of all that we might have achieved, of all the gifts which we have wasted, of all that we might have done which we did not do.","People ask me whether I'm religious. Well, in a certain way, I am.","I loathe my body. The liver spots, the sagging flesh.","God gives you the gift of melody or He doesn't - it's as simple as that.","I really don't think I have that much of the gift; I have a little bit, but I wish I were Schubert or Chopin or Beethoven, though Beethoven had a very difficult time writing melody, too.","It takes a Bobby White to make a tired 90-year-old composer write a song about love.","I have always felt that art, especially music, is but a demonstration of God.","A Schubert song, the A-major chord at the opening of Wagner's 'Lohengrin' - such incredible beauty is a mystery, the divinity of music.","I should have worked harder in my life. I suffer from a guilt complex.","I have the feeling that everybody was waiting for me to die so they could rediscover me. Then they found out I'm not dead yet, so they are rediscovering me while I'm still alive.","As a little boy of 3 or 4, I became lame. Something was wrong with my right leg. There are pictures of me being pulled around in a little wagon. The doctors didn't know what to do. So my nanny took me to the miraculous Madonna at Sacro Monte in Varese, the priest blessed me, and I walked.","At the premieres, I always watch the audience. If a child asks to go to the bathroom, I know I've failed.","For better or for worse, in 'The Last Savage,' I have dared to do away completely with fashionable dissonance, and in a modest way, I have endeavored to rediscover the nobility of gracefulness and the pleasure of sweetness.","Fate has blessed me.","I rebelled against the idea of the artist being what I call the 'after-dinner mint' of society. I didn't want them to be just the entertainers, but rather part of the community - the bread, not only the dessert.","It was my contention that opera can not only pay for itself if it is well given, but it can also command a much wider audience if given like a play with lots of rehearsals and wonderful singers that fit the role.","Now, all of a sudden, every college and every university has an opera theater. Every little city has its little group.","The only thing that interests me in music is to be able to reach into the, let's call it, 'collective unconscious' of what is noblest in the human spirit, the way you find in the music of Mozart and Beethoven and Verdi that wonderful quality that not a note can be changed.","My advice to composers is, 'Try to reach 90, and everyone will love you.'","I have a heart problem, so I have to simplify my life and be content with memories and friends and music.","I can sit on a chair with a score and give myself a wonderful performance.","The Greeks said the artist doesn't actually have to travel and look around. You stay where God has put you, and you dig as deep as you can. This is what I've done.","I guess I am running the risk of becoming the Hans Christian Andersen of opera.","I'm not very sympathetic to the tendency to bring art to the people.","It's always what you did before. The year before is always so much better. Even when the critics hated what you did then, it always looks better five years later.","The Italians are very unmusical. If I go to a Protestant church in London or Amsterdam or listen to a black choir, I hear four-part harmony. Italians could never do that. In Italy, we all have to sing the melody because we cannot harmonise.","The creation of Spoleto was a social experiment. Because I've always suffered guilt from being a Catholic, when I was in my fifties I felt a need of being needed."],"Gian Maria Volonte":["Being an actor is a matter of choice that, above all, takes place at an existential level: either you express the conservative structures of society and are nothing more that a tool in the hands of power, or you address the progressive components of this society in an attempt to settle a revolutionary relation between art and life.","The definition of political cinema is one I don't agree with, because every film, every show, is typically political in nature. Political cinema is simply the brainchild of bad journalists."],"Giancarlo Esposito":["I'm not too into fast food, but you know if I was, it would be chicken.","I don't think anyone is black and white and I think we change our minds and our attitudes about certain things as we grow to our maturity.","I love the smell of fried chicken.","I love to read, and I like the fact that there's some silence in my life.","Yoga is a big part of my life now. There's not a day that goes by where I don't do an Asana and mediation practice.","I try to be careful with my persuasiveness. When my heart is really behind it, and when I have no ulterior motive, then I know I'm truly persuasive.","To be a character actor is to be open, to be a chameleon.","For me, what I try to heal is the major thing that I think all of us go through, where we came from. From our family of origin.","I often think about, 'How do we return to a simpler way of living? Is there some way that we can start to think of each other as human beings again, instead of worshiping money, instead of worshiping electronics, instead of worshiping getting ahead just for me?'","When you're speaking Spanish, you're thinking in a different way.","I have from time to time been a double A or triple A personality. I'm not anymore. I'm more lenient on myself.","I never like to refer back to anything I've done when I'm working on a character, even if that character has the same occupation.","I believe acting is very physical, and when you have to fight or do those kinds of things, it takes a lot of respect not to allow yourself to go off and hurt yourself or someone else.","I look at 'Breaking Bad' as a show about the American family.","Middle-class people are becoming desperate. It can cause a moral man to break bad.","I'm a big fan of period pieces, and I'm a big fan of the old-time westerns.","I always wanted to be a boy scout but was too poor. Couldn't do it.","I had to work from a young age.","I can fish from a stick and a string.","When I perform on stage, you have to remember my performance or buy another ticket to the party! In television and film, you can see it over and over again.","I think many people have contradictions to them and I love characters that deal with those contradictions.","I do play villains.","I came from a divorced mother and father, obviously mixed race.","Luis Bunuel made great movies.","I'm impatient sometimes.","After 'Breaking Bad,' people are very frightened of who I am. They back away from me on the street.","For me, I've lived a life as an athlete.","People aren't able to make decisions anymore because there's too many choices within that decision.","The more I get connected to my own breath and my own yogic experience and my own prayer and my own idea, the ideas that have existed for so long - that we all belong to each other and we could live a deeper spiritual existence - the more I get connected to that, the more I shun this world.","When you're with another actor and doing something very intense, often you pull them over to your side, or they pull you over to theirs. But if you stay in your own truth, you can play that perfect tennis match. I always want to bring my power, but not in a way that eliminates the whole game!","I know from teaching that actors want to act. Even the subtlest actors can do a little too much.","It feels amazing to work with writers that write really well.","Yoga has allowed me to bring my complete spirit together, which allows me to do less, which is more.","I feel that we have come a long way as American people, and we have to start looking at ourselves as human beings.","I feel that sometimes, holding yourself as black, saying that is your sole identity, can sometimes stand in your way of being a member of the humanity of man, being a member of the family of the divine.","I want a body of work; I want a good story after a good story.","I'm not someone who is a fan of a lot of violence.","People who have not done their research on me do not know that I am European, born in Copenhagen, Denmark to an Italian father from Napoli and a mother from Alabama who was singing opera and went to Europe, met my dad, fell in love, and then moved back to Rome, where I was raised, between Rome and Hamburg.","There is a price to pay for most of our actions. For every action, there is a reaction.","It's certain that the death of an actor can be on a television screen playing the same thing every week.","I'm interested in spirituality and in religion and our relationship to the divine.","Well, with each character that I play in my life as an actor, I try to figure out how to find the challenge.","What I love about 'Breaking Bad' is the reflection of many people's - it's more real in terms of people have faults, people have character traits that they don't like about themselves. It resembles more of what the human journey really is and it's less fantastic and hero-driven than other characters and shows that we watch."],"Giancarlo Stanton":["High school is what kind of grows you into the person you are. I have great memories, good and bad, some learning experiences and some that I'll take with me the rest of my life.","I play to have fun. I play to win. I play for my teammates.","I like that I've been able to maintain a good stomach and chest. Push-ups and sit-ups are my go-to. It is the simplest routine and the best thing to maintain my stomach and chest. I'll do about 100 of each a day, usually when I'm already warmed up.","If there's a runner on third with less than two outs, I clearly do not want to strike out.","We've got to trust that we are all in it to win it.","I played basketball, baseball, and football. I never had much downtime. But I think playing multiple sports helped tremendously in my baseball career. I have the agility of all three combined into one.","There's not much you can complain about - you're a Major League Baseball player; you're getting paid to play a game. People want to be you, wish they could do what you do. There are some complaints here and there, but there really aren't any significant ones.","The game is nine innings. It's not two, three. It doesn't matter if it's the fifth through the seventh or the seventh through the ninth. It's not two innings - it's nine.","I could always hit the ball really far, but you don't need to be strong to do that.","Just got to keep moving. Progress.","Everyone has the answer. Everyone has this. You just got to move slowly. You get good little bits of advice and go from there.","You're not always happy with things that go on in life on a daily basis. There's nothing I can do. You've got to deal with it and still take care of myself.","Why would you give me so much money and not try to win? What on earth is the point of that? They have to be serious about winning going forward. There's no other logical explanation.","Just worry about the work you're doing and the process of that.","We don't just say this every spring training - 'Playoffs, World Series.' You've got to do it.","I'm very comfortable here. I enjoy all aspects of it. This is a place I want to make a stamp and bring something that Miami hasn't seen before.","I know I have a lot of expectations to live up to, which I need to do and am willing to do.","I want to have records on the field and do things on the field. That's what this is about.","I have only a relatively tiny gap of being at my best, in my prime. And I want to make a difference during that time.","I thought it'd be different. Kind of like, a lot of weight lifted off of my shoulders, as I don't have to worry about finances for the rest of my life, or my family's. But it wasn't like that. It was more - there's things I need to get done.","I don't want to get in trouble here, but the All-Star Game shouldn't count for anything. It should just be for fun.","People take everything out of proportion. Everybody loves to stir something. If you listen to everything you hear, there's a lot of different directions you'd be leaning.","I wanted to be a pro athlete. I knew that.","I hate striking out, but at the same time, I'm much better at letting them go rather than, earlier in my career, worrying about it so much before the next at-bat against the guy. You grow as you play, and every year, I work to cut them down.","I hate it, but a popout is the same as a strikeout. It's a matter of productive at-bats, a matter of how you do it.","I do what I love every day.","I always tried to be Mark McGwire and hit homers like he did. I was kind of following his race, too, when he was trying to break the record.","I like to connect with fans, usually positive stuff. If there is negative stuff, you just look past it and talk to the people that appreciate you.","I play 'MLB 2K,' 'Madden,' and some old-school 'Mario Kart.'","It's not like my body has changed since I've played in high school, beyond being more mature. It's not like my power has changed, either.","Training isn't fun for me. I do it because it's what my body needs, and I have a standard. It's a thing I make sure I do.","The one thing I didn't understand was the Minor Leagues, how that part of the business works. I'd see Todd Hollandsworth out there one game, and the next game he wouldn't be there, and I didn't understand.","I can deal with losing as long as one is trying to win. If you're losing, and you're not trying to win, that is not fair.","I'm not going to change the way I work out in the offseason and prepare. I'm not going to change the way I approach the game. I'm not going to change the way I play every day.","It's never fun to sit and watch, especially when you think you could be impacting the game.","I just want the pants and shoes to match - it doesn't have to be a high-end brand for me to wear it.","That is where I got my childhood memories, watching the Home Run Derby as a kid. Maybe some kids are watching me. I would like to return that.","You want to stick with one sport and master one thing and be good, yeah, you might be able to go to more combines, but the life experiences and athleticism you get from playing three sports or whatever will stick with you and help you progress.","I recommend multiple sports for sure. The memories I have bouncing around for each sport, having to juggle some in the same day, it's tough; it's difficult.","They say in baseball, your little flaws will stick with you from the start. It's just how you can maintain and minimize them.","As long as you don't fold up and curl up into a ball, you'll be all right.","If I'm ready to play, I want to play.","I'm a good beginning key.","Yeah, I'm financially good for the rest of my life - great. But I'm not trying to come here, get my butt kicked for 10 years, and go home to a lavish lifestyle. That's not fun for me.","I don't want to come to an empty stadium.","You can't change the past with a couple good months.","I want to win, and I want to win in Miami.","It's strictly winning that is going to bring back the fan market.","I don't need to go every day and re-evaluate, 'Am I living up to this? Or that or this?'","I'm going to prepare up to the best of my ability, either way. I'll alter it as I need to."],"Gianfranco Ferre":["The design of a dress, furniture, a house, a room, a street and a city are all the same process.","As an architect, I learned to think and express myself on flat forms, on paper, and to imagine the contour of the lines of a design."],"Gianluigi Buffon":["I believe in doing the right things; that is my character and personality.","The day I quit, I want people to be sad about it.","When you have the chance to play a Champions League final, you have to win it.","The role of a goalkeeper is difficult to judge, above all if you haven't been a goalkeeper. It's like me giving an opinion on someone's job without having had any experience in their sector. You start to realise how many stupid things are said and written about goalkeepers.","In the end, you need to be a little masochistic to be a goalkeeper. A masochist and egocentric as well.","When you go somewhere and think it will be your last time there, you always appreciate the beauty of it even more and want to crystallise emotions that you will keep with you forever.","I have not lost an awful lot in my life, but the defeats have taught me more than the victories.","Not looking for excuses is the right thing to do. I have made a lot of mistakes, and I still make mistakes, but I am not ashamed to look for the reasons behind those mistakes.","I've made a lot of mistakes in my life, but I think that's normal for someone who wants to grow and develop. You will have to overcome plenty of obstacles, and it is normal that you should stumble sometimes.","Often, there are fallacies when a journalist or a fan and sometimes even a coach who has never been a goalkeeper sees a cross in the six-yard box and says he should come out.","In football, you win as a group, you lose as a group; you divide the credit and the blame.","Don't be a keeper.","If I can push myself up to the 2018 World Cup, then I'll go on. After that, I'll close the door and stop playing football.","Up to 30 years old, I was carried by natural talent, combined with a good level of professionalism. But since turning 30, I've gained a desire to sweat in the real sense of the word, to understand where I need to improve. Competitiveness, now, is essential.","How do I imagine my last-ever game? Maybe I'll go out like Zidane, headbutting someone on the pitch!","If I do something, I do it with the idea to get to the top - without that, I would stop living.","I do not need to hear how I am judged by others. I know by myself if I can be satisfied or not with my work.","I took what I've been given, and I got where I did on the basis of something that is often undervalued - merit.","To the fans, it does not matter a damn how you are. You are seen as the footballer, the idol, so no one thinks to stop and ask you, 'Hey, how are you?'","I was 12 when I turned my back on my goal. And I will keep doing it as long as my legs, my head, and my heart will allow.","Messi is an alien that dedicates himself to playing with humans.","Maybe I'm the only footballer who isn't interested in cars. My Lancia Y gets me around.","People don't mind you feeling low if you are still performing. But if you've shared too much, and suddenly your performance dips, that's when they start doubting you.","Every kid thinks about scoring rather than not conceding.","Whenever I lose, I focus on the ability of my opponent and on the mistakes I made.","Even if I were offered twice my salary elsewhere, I would stay at Juve. Doing so would make me proud, as it is a worthy thing to do.","In this job, you accept criticism and give answers on the field.","I do not take to the field to defend myself from certain criticisms. If I do, in this kind of career, it is because I'm very self-critical.","I don't give advice, because I always made my own mistakes and would only be adding further chaos to the situation.","More than anything else, I'm a very calm person in the sense that I don't worry about the future and what my life could be. I just have to face it, and I'll face it with enthusiasm as well as the desire and curiosity to test myself.","I have not lost an awful lot in my life, but the defeats have taught me more than the victories. Whenever I lose, I focus on the ability of my opponent and on the mistakes I made.","I went through a lot of changes and a period of depression. I'd reached an age when I had to grow up and start taking life a bit more seriously, which had a huge impact on me. I suffered terrible anxiety, and sometimes, in the middle of a game, my legs would start shaking uncontrollably. It was pretty scary.","My first memory of the national team is the 1982 World Cup. I remember those days at our home or at my uncle's house, with all the family and those long dinners watching the matches. But I also remember that, during the games, I went outside or onto the balcony to play.","I have a wealth of experience, but I do not want to coach. I rather like the role of recruiter.","I thought psychologists were people who rob, figuratively of course, money from the insecure. But they are not. They are people who are there to help you, and if you find a good psychologist, they will allow you to talk about everything and open up, without the slightest of fears, and that is no easy thing.","In my opinion, there are fewer and fewer great goalkeepers because, with respect to when I started, they have to do so much more compared with in the past.","The pitch is the most beautiful part of the game; it gives you emotions which bring meaning to life.","It's fine to admit being nervous - after the event. But if you tell people you're uptight before the game, it can be like, 'That guy's got problems. We can't trust him.'","Everyone gets scared from time to time. It's totally normal, and anyone who says otherwise is a liar.","I followed tennis a little. I liked Lendl, Edberg, and Rafter.","There is certainly a future for Italian football, as we have pride, ability, determination, and after bad tumbles, we always find a way to get back on our feet.","I cannot appreciate anybody who creates controversy over things which do not exist. I can tolerate controversy over things which truly happened, but not over inexistent things.","The important thing is to be ready when the team needs me. As long as I can do that, I consider myself satisfied and happy.","I really hate strikers.","I don't want to disrespect anyone, but it's clear that any team which has the chance to play with Messi, Suarez, and Neymar has devastating attacking power, which any coach would love at his disposal.","No record belongs to just one person, and there are no number ones outside of a group.","Even though the Premier League is a special league, I have always wanted to stay loyal to Juventus.","When you're on the field, you've got to deliver. It doesn't matter what you potentially could deliver or what you might be able to deliver in future - you've got to deliver it there and then.","Pogba is one of those players who leaves you speechless.","I can no longer understand what the parameters are for valuing a player. It's all too random and in the hands of whoever has more money.","I started to play, like all kids do, not as a goalkeeper. I liked scoring goals; in the end, it's all about scoring goals.","My dad suggested I change and try to play in goal. I always liked being at the heart of the action, trying to experience different situations and different challenges. One year, I decided to try playing in goal - after that, I was going to go back to playing outfield.","Who knows? I might retire at the age of 65.","Would I still be playing at the top level at the age of 37 years if I had any weaknesses?"],"Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki":["My joy is watching people being joyful.","In the United States, nobody needs to remind people of their own role or their own power in creating the future they want to see. Perhaps it is something that is almost written into your cultural DNA: a desire to answer your Founding Fathers' call to create a 'more perfect union.'","You have to have the courage to face the unexpected. This is the difference between people who do things and people who don't dare, who don't dare to live.","My father in his way influenced me and my sister to educate ourselves and to try to do things in life.","The Olympic Games are a national cause, and a national cause calls for a nationwide attitude.","He was not like Greek fathers. He didn't tell us to get married. My father thought it was very important that we travel, learn languages, be educated."],"Gianni Agnelli":["I mean, what Fiat had it was not very big, it was something like forty or fifty million dollars, but it's enough to get revolving credit, to get starting away again, the buying of new machinery.","All the technology of our production was still pre-War. They were sort of '38, '39 and the War had been stable and so we were infinitely behind whatever had been going on in the United States for instance.","And I don't say that we didn't expect it, but we were pleasantly surprised to see the generosity of their foreign policy; and the generosity of their foreign policy at that moment was expressed through the Marshall Plan.","And the buying of new machinery meant not only the possibility of production, but even the new technology, 'cos as I mentioned before, we were back of seven, eight years.","Italy in the first years got food, for the first year or the first periods got food. Then we got raw materials and then we got tool machines, let's say, instruments for working.","Now between '45 and '48, things would change enormously, 'cos we'd had credit in United States, credit from the Bank of America, credit from the Import-Export Bank and people had started working again.","The factories were heavily bombed, but practically the construction work had been redone very quickly.","Well, Italy had been overrun by the War, there had practically been civil war, north and south of the Gothic Line, heavy bombing, the northern industrial cities had been bombed heavily and we had political disorder before 1948.","Well, the Communists at that moment were very strong in Italy and the Italian Communist Party was the biggest Communist Party outside Soviet Union, there's no doubt about that."],"Gianni Versace":["In the past, people were born royal. Nowadays, royalty comes from what you do.","That is the key of this collection, being yourself. Don't be into trends. Don't make fashion own you, but you decide what you are, what you want to express by the way you dress and the way to live.","I am not interested in the past, except as the road to the future.","I want to see my niece and nephew grow up, to see their children... I get crazy at the idea that a time will come when I won't see Daniel and Allegra anymore.","I want to be the joy to people through my work.","It is nice to have valid competition; it pushes you to do better.","I never fall down. I always fight.","I am a typical Italian; I love the clan. But I don't think about getting married.","Comfort is very important to me. I think people live better in big houses and in big clothes.","Even Michelangelo got paid for doing the Sistine Chapel. To those artists who say they're doing it for the love of art, I say: Get real.","I have a fantastic relationship with money. I use it to buy my freedom.","For me, the summer will be pure gray - mother-of-pearl gray, very pale gray. To me, this is the big statement for summer. Then we have light blue, light turquoise, lots of pink.","I like the body. I like to design everything to do with the body.","My only dream is to get old and finally have time to read all the books that I'm collecting.","I liked women as a shape to dress.","I want always to be positive.","I really want to make clothes that are feminine and help women look beautiful.","My dream was always to be a composer, but fashion came very easily.","I think it's the responsibility of a designer to try to break rules and barriers.","I'm a little like Marco Polo, going around and mixing cultures.","I don't license everywhere. I take care of my name.","I want to be a designer for my time.","I try to contrast; life today is full of contrast... We have to change.","At the beginning of my career, it was very hard to go up. Now, it's very hard to stay on top. You have to stay there, and I want to stay there so badly. I'm still standing.","Women are more sure of themselves today. They don't have to emulate the way men dress.","Designing came to me. I didn't have to move.","I learned to work with my mother, who had an haute-couture business.","Fashion needs incredible women, alive, stimulating, with style like Diana Vreeland. She is the most. The way she talks expresses all her values.","The environment was so strong, so dramatic. Tragedy is all over Calabria; it's in the air. All this corresponds to my temperament."],"Gib Lewis":["Since they all broke up the greatest conference in football, which was the Southwest Conference, I've had little interest in them any more. I thought that was a disaster and a disgrace when they did that, but they did it anyway. So I've lost interest them and I don't care what they do anymore.","Shoot, after you've been through freeway traffic in Houston or Dallas, there's no road in the world that can scare you. Besides, we're pretty much used to driving long distances in Texas."],"Gideon Raff":["Here in Israel, we want the boys back home, we demand it from our government, who often pay a steep price to get hostages back. But we need a happy ending. We don't want to deal with those days after release, their post-trauma or reintroduction to society. Yet coming home is only the start of their journey.","When you live far away, home looks a little different every time.","The lives of prisoners of war after they are returned is almost never discussed, never explored.","The PoWs went through something so horrible, you don't know who's coming back.","When I tell my American counterparts that my budget was $200,000 per episode, they burst out laughing. To us that's a big production, to them it's a guerrilla shoot.","Israel's a small country but both the audience and programme-makers are very sophisticated.","I'm Israeli and gay.","In America, after 9/11, and after the death of bin Laden, and after two wars, one of them fought, a lot of people think, on false pretenses, and definitely post the Patriot Act, there are a lot of these questions about what can we do to our citizens in order to prevent the next attack.","Whenever I look at pictures of horrific things that soldiers do or that have been done to soldiers I always feel sorry for everybody involved because politics throws them into these horrific situations where really it's just 18-year-old kids."],"Gideon Welles":["It is vain to expect a well-balanced government without a well-balanced society.","The hopeless grief of those poor colored people affected me more than almost anything else.","This crowd did not diminish through the whole of that cold, wet day; they seemed not to know what was to by their fate since their great benefactor was dead, and though strong and brave men wept when I met them.","The War has been waged with success, although there have been in some instances errors and misfortunes. But the heart of the nation is sounder and its hopes brighter."],"Gifford Pinchot":["Unless we practice conservation, those who come after us will have to pay the price of misery, degradation, and failure for the progress and prosperity of our day.","Conservation means the wise use of the earth and its resources for the lasting good of men.","The earth and its resources belong of right to its people.","Innovations never happen as planned.","The vast possibilities of our great future will become realities only if we make ourselves responsible for that future.","World-wide practice of Conservation and the fair and continued access by all nations to the resources they need are the two indispensable foundations of continuous plenty and of permanent peace.","The outgrowth of conservation, the inevitable result, is national efficiency."],"Gig Young":["30 years and 55 pictures - not more than five that were any good, or any good for me.","My specialties are corpses, unconscious people and people snoring in spectacular epics."],"Gigi Hadid":["My sister is my little star, and I'm excited for her and proud of her. With her, I'm protective, but also I don't want to be that sister who's really pushy and thinks they know everything and making her feel like she doesn't know what she's doing. I'm trying to be that cool older sister and not the mom, but it's hard.","I always say, 'Eat clean to stay fit; have a burger to stay sane.'","A camel is a very awkward animal to ride, and it's very hard to get used to because they're not very graceful.","Everyone has a different body shape, so you kind of have to figure out not only what works best for your body type, but what also makes you feel confident. Even if everyone thinks you look good in a bikini, and you don't feel good in it, you're not going to be at your best. If you feel great in a bikini, you can always work it.","I've learned that if I only put my mind to one thing that I can get tunnel vision. Then I may not be as open to other opportunities because I'm so focused on one thing. I think what's worked better for me personally is I have three goals every day: be nice, work hard, and make friends.","I think it's really important that I'm not the only model in the world that goes through personal problems. People forget that we're human. We don't get to call in sick. You have to go and put on a smile. Every single day is a first impression, so you can't have a bummed-out day.","My mom was a model. She met my dad when he was building the Ritz-Carlton in Colorado and she was modeling there. Although we were very blessed, my parents never wanted us to believe we didn't have to work. They didn't want us to think that our situation would get us through life.","I personally think my sister is so stunning without makeup. And she doesn't wear that much makeup because she has the best skin color.","We get to live in a time that we get to use social media as a tool. It's not just a face on a piece of paper, and that's what makes you someone's favorite model. We can have a very similar sense of humor as someone, and that's why we're their favorite model, or our personal style, off the runway, is why we're their favorite.","My biggest thing about being a role model is whatever I'm preaching, I'm practicing. If I'm telling people I'm boxing and then I'm eating a burger tonight, it's because I am. I'm not cheating and eating a salad and then being like, 'Yeah! Burgers are cool!'","My mom always taught me to put toothpaste on pimples to dry them out at night. I do that all the time. I don't use anything fancy when I get a pimple. And I never use the same toothpaste for long because I get bored. So I'll do peppermint and then one month I'll do cinnamon. I'm creative.","I'm really lucky to have a lot of friends in fashion. I don't know if that's common, but I just get along with a lot of people. My really close friends are Ireland Baldwin, Kendall Jenner, Lily Aldridge and Devon Windsor.","Using the right colour is the most important thing. When sculpting is well done, it just looks like you have great brows.","My mom was a model, so she's been really good about giving me tips on how to navigate behind the scenes - like the importance of being nice to everyone on set and remembering people's names, to how to be a positive part of the photo shoot and stuff like that.","Not enough people know what Lyme disease is and the dangers of being bitten by an insect.","I post pictures that I want to post and say what I want to say. If that's three times a day or three times per month, then whatever.","My mentality has always been, If I'm not the best at something, then I might as well be the best at something else. I realized that I wasn't going to be an Olympic volleyball player, but I knew I could model at that level.","As for middle school, I had a really horrible era of style. I'd only play basketball with the boys during lunch, so I went through a phase of only wearing Lakers uniforms to school - that was cute! And then I kind of went through the Puma phase that everyone went through with the sweatsuits, which turned into Juicy Couture sweatsuits.","I will be the first to say, when I started, I was the worst on the runway ever. I feel like I try to keep learning every time I step off a runway; I try to get better with each one. I hope that I'm getting better as I go - it takes a few seasons to get your Karlie Kloss walk on.","When you're two, three, four years old, it's not really modelling. You run around, and they give you toys in a fun place, and they take pictures of you playing.","I eat healthy when I can; I eat a burger when I want, and I work out. You have to live with the routine that keeps your body the healthiest, and that's what I do - I don't change it for a swimsuit shoot. You have to figure out what works with your body the best.","I don't really have the patience to do my hair, which is why it's always parted down the middle, slicked, in a low ponytail or a messy high bun. I'm too lazy to do my own hair, but I like doing my makeup.","I'm always tan and blonde and don't really fit into New York. I'm a California girl, even if I try and cover it up with leather.","I pay attention to how every makeup artist does everything.","You know where the best McDonald's is? Dubai. Because they have regulation on the meat, so it's really, really good.","Honestly... I only get starstruck over chefs.","Once you just tell yourself, 'OK, I'm going to have a breakdown right now, and I'm going to cry for an hour, put my phone away. I'm going to go swimming, and then I'm gonna make my family dinner and lay on the couch and watch 'Ru Paul's Drag Race,' once you accept that it's not the day and you can just have a breakdown, you're over it.","I've always said that I feel lucky to live in the era of social media and be a working model in this time. Back in the day, models were just another face. But social media has given people a voice and not just another face. Not only can you show the world your personality and stuff like that, but you can be a brand ambassador easily.","In real life, I'm so goofy and super weird. I'm never mean, but people don't see the weird side of me. Like, I'll be dancing around. My best friends will always say that they wish others saw that side of me, when I'm doing a weird dance or weird faces or voices.","I know that the designers that have me in their shows have me for a reason, I know that the designers that don't have me in their shows don't have me for a reason, and I accept either way.","No, I'm not the first or last model of my type in this industry. You can make up all the reasons you think I am where I am, but really, I'm a hard worker that's confident in myself - one that came at a time where the fashion industry was ready for a change.","I represent a body image that wasn't accepted in high fashion before, and I'm very lucky to be supported by the designers, stylists, and editors that I am: ones that know this is fashion; this is art. It can never stay the same. It's 2015.","I can eat healthy when I want to, and I can work out every single day, and I can have the body for a certain runway show if I need to, but that doesn't mean that I'm doing it in an unhealthy way.","I love sports - I used to play volleyball really competitively...I went to Junior Olympic qualifiers, and I've ridden horses my whole life.","I grew up on the beach, so I'm really comfortable in a bathing suit, playing volleyball, running around.","You find how you feel your best, whether you feel better when you're eating gluten-free or whatever it is. I feel better when I eat a burger every other night.","People can see a picture of my body from the neck down and know who it is because of my beauty marks or whatever you call them, moles. I've always had them, and I've always loved them. Obviously you have to be careful with that; I get them checked regularly and make sure that they're healthy.","Twitter is the place where I try to be more funny. And then I use Instagram just as my diary. I pull some jokes on there, but I think people have a better sense of humor on Twitter.","I think that something photographers find about me is that I work really hard to make sure I know what they want before I start shooting.","My makeup artist likes to define my brows with Maybelline Brow Drama. We brush up on the part closest to my nose and it's straight after that. Then, I like to use the matte brown shades from Maybelline The Nudes Palette to shadow my eyes, but without it looking like I'm wearing much.","High school is when I started to get my sense of fashion together. My queen was Candice Swanepoel, who is a friend of mine now, which is kind of funny, but in high school, I was obsessed. I love her street style: she is always in cool boyfriend jeans, boots, and an awesome coat, which is very much like what I wear.","Fashion is really a place where every other industry connects, whether it's music or acting. At the end of the day, everyone is going to walk the red carpet and be interested in the fashion side of it. I think that's really cool because as a model, you get to connect with a lot of different worlds.","A lot of the time, we're shooting summer campaigns in winter because they have to come out the next season. It's the hardest to feel great in a bikini when it's cold... so I appreciate a swimsuit shoot that's in warm weather.","I've been watching Maybelline commercials since I was little and singing along with the jingle and doing little Maybelline commercials in my bathroom when I was, like, 10.","I usually stalk fans because I think they're really funny on Twitter. They don't know it, but I'll just go through their timelines, and if something is happening in the media, I always read fan accounts instead of the news because they have all the info and make the funniest jokes about it, so that's how I get my gossip - by stalking fans.","I was discovered by Paul Marciano of Guess when I was actually, like, two years old. And so I started with Baby Guess; I did Guess Kids, and then I stopped because I was a really competitive horseback rider and a club volleyball player. I went to Junior Olympic qualifiers for volleyball. So, I kind of stopped modeling.","You're on set for 15 hours, and then you go home and make sure you're posting the right stuff on social media, and then you answer your e-mails. It never stops.","In middle school, I wasn't allowed to wear makeup. I secretly bought Maybelline's SuperStay 24-hr. concealer at CVS. I thought it was the coolest thing in the world.","I think that it's nice when someone can go and look more exotic and do the girl-next-door thing as well.","I know this sounds weird, but I was into storyboarding when I was younger. I loved coming up with my own style through fashion blogs and magazines. But I've never liked trying things on. I don't know why. It was more about making mood boards. I've loved fashion my whole life, but more the imagery of it than actually wearing it.","It's really about making opportunities for yourself and connecting with people on a more-than-normal level. That opens doors. You never know if the caterer's brother is someone. You don't know who someone is having dinner with that night. So being a nice person and touching people creates opportunity.","My Pirelli calendar is hanging on the wall of my friend's frat house, and he doesn't know anything about fashion. That balance is what leads to big campaigns outside of fashion. But I never want to choose one or the other. Both commercial and high fashion are what make my job so interesting.","I have more than 4 million followers on Instagram. All the companies I work for want me to guarantee how much I'll post for them, but I'm not going to force my career onto the people who follow me. I refuse to do 40 Instagram posts about any campaign.","As long as they want me modeling, I'll be here. But I hope to maybe have a cooking show one day or host a talk show when I'm older and have a developed brand. That would be really fun.","In third grade, I played basketball with the boys every day at lunch. I had braces that were yellow and purple, and I wore full Laker uniforms to school.","I love St. Ives Apricot Scrub, and you can just get that at CVS - it's so good, though; it's my favorite! Usually I only use that when I shower, because if I don't shower, I'm usually too tired to wash my face and just use Maybelline cleansing wipes. And then I use Chanel Hydra Beauty Lotion. That's so good, I love it.","I'm kind of the model that everyone thought would always be the Guess, 'Sports Illustrated' girl. Then, when I started to do high fashion stuff... people were like, 'Oh, so we can have a girl with, like, thighs and a butt in a Tom Ford campaign. Cool.'","When I first went to visit different agencies in New York, a lot of them were like, 'You have to lose a lot of weight.'","I personally would rather do the Master Cleanse for ten days than just eat salad for six months.","I started modeling when I was about 2 or 3 years old; I started with Baby Guess, and I did Guess Kids, and that was the extent of my modeling career as a kid. I took all of my elementary, middle and high school years off to focus on school and sports.","Rag & Bone is a big part of my closet. I just really like how their jeans fit; I wear them a lot, and I think they make really cool staple pieces.","In California, I'm more of a beach chick, and I kind of take on a model city girl when I'm in New York.","I'm kind of a grandma, so I like cooking for my boyfriend and watching a movie. I cook a lot, actually. I'll make bacon-wrapped asparagus, steak, and pesto pasta with chicken...but we go out to dinner a fair amount, too.","I usually do my hair and makeup in 30 to 45 minutes, and if my hair is dirty, I'll just put it in a bun or a ponytail. If it's in a bun, I'll part it down the middle and do a low bun with a couple pieces in the front coming down.","I was always in front of the camera. My mom was really passionate about photography - I have pictures of my whole life. I've always just been in front of my mom's camera, and it's always comfortable to me.","When I was young, I did Baby Guess and Guess Kids - Paul Marciano saw me when I was a baby and decided I was going to be his next whatever. After Guess Kids, my mom made me stop. She would not let me sign with an agency until I was 17 because she wanted me to be a normal kid and accept myself for who I was.","I went to almost all of the agencies in New York when I first visited. A lot of them wanted to sign me but also kind of indirectly were telling me that I needed to change in some way. Some directly told me that I wouldn't be a model unless I changed the way that my body looked.","My thighs were huge; they were like rock! Growing up, I was really athletic, and I had a very athletic body.","I'm the only one in - of my siblings, my mom and my family - that hasn't been affected by Lyme disease. It's been really hard for me because I'm the only one that doesn't really understand it.","When I was 11, I made truffle risotto for my family for Christmas dinner.","The first year I lived in New York, I tried a different burger every week to find my favorite burger in New York.","I am the biggest foodie ever.","Coming back to Guess is so natural for me; they're my family. I always love being back, and to be able to come home and be in Malibu across the street from my high school shooting this campaign is absolutely amazing and just feels like the right thing.","I'm all for one month of going really hard and eating really healthy and boxing every day if you're doing it for, like, one job.","If you're not a makeup artist, and you just try to go for the big looks, it just gets the best of you.","I have a weird thing against facials. I feel like all day my face is being touched and messed with on set, so I don't want more people touching my face!","I've learned very quickly to fall asleep wherever I can. I sleep in the car from event to event or show to show sometimes.","People always make fun of my eyebrows and think that I shape them this way! But if you see a picture of me from when I was two years old, I have the same exact eyebrow shape.","I like experimenting with different hair care, and when I get sick of it, I always mix it up. Ghd makes this mousse that I add to John Frieda's Frizz Ease, and it makes a ponytail hold really well.","I just started using this app called Wine and Dine. It's like Instagram, but only for food. You post what you're eating and follow your friends, and then you can say, 'I wanna try that,' and so when you go on your 'wanna try' list, it'll tell you where it is.","I only box. It's the only thing that keeps me sane. I can't just go to the gym and run. I'd rather die. I played volleyball and rode horses my entire life, so just, like, moving to a city and having to go the gym was just, like, so weird for me.","I'm from Malibu, California. Once I tell people, they're like, 'Oh, of course you're from Malibu; that makes sense.' I guess I am your typical just-graduated-high-school-in-Malibu type of girl. Our school was just across from Zuma beach, and we all wore Lululemons and bathing suit tops to go to the grocery store - no makeup, no shoes.","I'm 19 now, and I go to The New School in New York, where I study Criminal Psychology. My first week of second semester was during Fashion Week when my first editorials in 'CR Fashion Book' and 'Sports Illustrated' came out. It was crazy!","It's good to know how to be sexy, but something I'm still trying to work on is learning how to not be sexy, because that's an important part of growing as a model.","You have to realise that everyone that you are working with is important. It doesn't matter where you are starting from; you are always going to run back into those people, and they are going to talk, and that's going to be the base of whether you get good opportunities or not.","It sounds really cheesy, but I've just really been so focused on making sure that I am nice to everyone that I work with and making the effort to get to know the people on set, whether it's the catering crew or the famous photographer.","The bigger fan base you have, the more companies will be attracted to you. And having a following, you can be so much more involved being a representative with the brand you're working with.","I know that I won't be modelling forever, but I think I'll be in the entertainment industry. I would love to host a talk show one day or have a cooking show. I love to cook... I'm really open, so we'll see.","I just try to be in tune with my body. If I start to feel sick, I will try to catch it at the root. I don't really let myself get to the point where it becomes a problem. That's so important when you're travelling because if you land in Paris and you have to go from the airport straight to set, you don't have time to go to the doctor.","I'm a really big Juice Press fan. There is a store right around the corner from my apartment in New York.","I box every day when I'm in New York.","Boxing has been great for me because it's, like, my new sport, so it's something that I can get better at.","Even if I have no other makeup on, I always want a nude lip, and if I'm going to do a bright, I want it to be matte.","No, I don't think I have the same body type as the other models in shows. No, I don't think I am the best at any given show. Yes, I want a unique walk, but I also know I have to improve.","What people want to know is, OK, what's after modeling? It's not just OK anymore to model until you're 25 and then stop and be a housewife.","If you look at sculptures from hundreds of years ago, everyone's naked. It's not a bad thing.","My first-ever concert was the Barney concert when I was, like, six. My mum took me because I was obsessed with Barney. Barney was actually my first crush... He's, like, literally better than all the guys in the whole world.","My order from Starbucks is an ice chai with one less pump of chai because I feel like they put too much, and it's, like, too sweet, and it's overwhelming.","One time, my ex-boyfriend and I were in Paris, and we went to this really fancy dinner. We weren't full after, so we walked from the schmoozy restaurant to McDonald's, and we finished our date at McDonald's. It was awesome."],"Gijs de Vries":["If you exchange information internationally, you must strengthen data protection. Those are two sides of the same coin.","In intelligence work, there are limits to the amount of information one can share. Confidentiality is essential.","You can't get closer to the heart of national sovereignty than national security and intelligence services.","I have never come across a technology that doesn't change. This is inevitable. You have to adapt your systems as technology develops.","We still lack a global definition of terrorism.","We're still stymied by the old stand-off between those who wish to fight terrorism and resistance fighters.","Indiscriminate attacks on civilians ought, under all circumstances, to be illegal in war as in peacetime.","Europe has a long and tragic history of mostly domestic terrorism.","We are familiar with terrorism. But indiscriminate, cross-border, religiously motivated terrorism is new.","We remain vulnerable. There is no such thing as 100 percent security against terrorism.","Terrorists always have the advantage of surprise.","Terrorists have failed in what is arguably al Qaida's most important objective - to trigger revolutions.","Terrorists have failed to trigger mass conflict between Muslims and non-Muslims in Europe. We should draw strength from that fact.","Ultimately, freedom and democracy are stronger than fear and tyranny.","In the fight against terrorism, national agencies keep full control over their police forces, security and intelligence agencies and judicial authorities.","The European Borders Agency in Warsaw has been created to help border forces in Europe cooperate more.","We have an integrated picture of the threat from outside and from within that is provided not only to our foreign ministers but also to our justice and interior ministers.","There are no automatic links between poverty and terrorism. Among millions of poor people in the world, only a few turn to terrorism.","In situations of military conflict, civil strife, lawlessness, bad governance, and human rights violations, terrorists find it easier to hide, train and prepare their attacks.","The violent radicals do not legitimately represent the overwhelming majority of the world's Muslims.","It's important that we work very closely with moderate Muslim forces locally, nationally and internationally.","If information ends up in the wrong hands, the lives of people very often are immediately at risk.","If you combat an international phenomenon, it is indispensable to share information internationally.","The central role in the fight against terrorism is with national authorities.","There is a series of sectors which could be severely disrupted by terrorist attacks, particularly if they were to happen in several member states simultaneously.","I remain optimistic. What we've seen in Europe and the rest of the world is that freedom has a much stronger attraction than radical fundamentalism.","Police forces collect information to be used in a public court to get people convicted. Security services gather information that does not necessarily lead to people being prosecuted and in many cases needs to remain confidential.","The idea is to have global standards. There is so much travel that if you just had a regional standard, it would probably ultimately have to be changed.","The majority of the world's Muslims do not believe that terrorism is a legitimate strategy or that Islam is incompatible with democracy.","The key to tackling Islamist fundamentalism and terrorism from the Islamist community is in the hands of moderate Muslims.","Our strategy should be to strengthen the hand of moderate Muslims.","Look at Iraq; look at Afghanistan, where at great personal physical risk people have gone to the polls and have rejected the appeal from Bin Laden and his allies to stay at home.","Muslim organisations tend to have a low level of organisation. The communities in Europe are quite diverse."],"Gil Bellows":["The great thing about acting is that, until you're dead, you can do it. There are aspects to it that as time goes on you hope you get better at, and there are a lot of things that I'm excited to explore.","I'd say that I'm super proud of only four or five things I've done, but mostly I'd like to be remembered as a really good actor who people enjoyed watching."],"Gil Gerard":["I'm currently raising a 15 year old son and an 18 year old daughter, which a guess is my punishment for a wild youth!","I have a project at HBO and one at the Family Channel coming that are being looked at. Aside from that I am not doing much more than playing golf and some skiing.","I brought my personality and sense of wonder and I think they wrote as much of my personality as they could. I do not go around kicking butt and saving the universe all the time but they tried to capture me as best as they could in the character.","Yes, I did some rewrites of the show as some of the stuff was not very good and I worked my butt off to make it something that the audience liked and that I could be proud of.","It is amazing that something I did 23 years ago still has an audience that people respond to and I am touched and surprised that people are still very positive about.","I think people connect better with TV. stars over film stars.","I liked working with Tom Christopher as he was great as Hawk, and Wilfred Hyde White but I wished it were in a different context as the changes really tuned off the audience.","No, I was talking to the network and Universal about plans for a third season where Buck would go back to Earth and would focus on stories around the planet and show what it was like 500 years later.","The basic answer is that I wasn't happy or fulfilled by the job I had and I wanted my life to mean something to me, so I searched my life experience and realized that acting and performing were activities that I enjoyed all aspects of.","I wouldn't trade the experiences I've had over the past 36 years for anything.","I made the character as much of myself as I could.","Then I got the offer to play Buck Rogers, but I turned it down thinking it was a cartoon character. Well I was wrong, it wasn't at all. So I read the script and decided I liked the character, it had a good concept.","Although there were only about 24 episodes made it seems to run forever. They take a couple of episodes and put them together, making a feature film once in a while. I had good fun making the series.","Other effects in the show included models of the ships which were extremely expensive to make. We used to do our shots in front of a blue screen and they'd put the effects on after.","The show originally started out as a ten hour mini-series. We shot two hours and then were excused for a while, for no apparent reason. Things went very quiet for a time and then a few months later we were called back and told that it was going to be a full season.","Up to that point I never really knew what my character would be expected to do, and prior to accepting the job I had actually turned down the role three times before finally giving in.","People would say I really loved Buck Rogers until the Hawk guy came on.","It's more fun having him as everyman in the 25th Century. It is better to concentrate on what this planet will be like 500 years from now, and not be dealing with little aliens in space and all that related stuff.","I'd always wanted the show to be more reality based science fiction, something along the lines of The Day the Earth Stood Still, which I consider to be the classic science fiction film.","Prior to that I produced a couple of TV movies for CBS, but the truth of the matter is that I burned out for a couple of years. I didn't do anything for a while, apart from taking up golf, for which I got a four handicap.","I've now returned to the business again because I finally realised that I really enjoy the creative process.","Some writers and producers are currently writing a sitcom for me, so we'll see what happens there. I'm somewhat reluctant to talk about some of the upcoming projects that I'm working on; I've a lot of stuff on the go, including five pictures that I'm looking at producing.","I have a superstition about saying too much about what I want to happen, just in case it all disappears, or someone else comes along and beats me to it.","I've just got into the convention circuit in the last couple of years and it's great to see all these people who are still interested in the show. It's so gratifying to hear that so many people enjoyed the work that Erin and I have done."],"Gil Hodges":["Many children work hard to please their parents, but what I truly longed for was good times that were about us, not about me. That is the real hole the Dodgers filled in my life.","Well, I know that I'll never forget that, but also I won't forget the hundreds of people who sent me letters, telegrams, and postcards during that World Series. There wasn't a single nasty message. Everybody tried to say something nice.","I can't very well tell my batters don't hit it to him. Wherever they hit it, he's there anyway."],"Gil Kane":["It was exactly an assembly line. You could look into infinity down these rows of drawing tables.","I was hired as a penciler.","All of the penciling was consistently done by one person and the inking was whoever could finish on time.","Then the war became a real problem and along with other shortages, they started to have paper problems.","In other words, DC was never harmed by the paper shortages.","Coming into the business, you'd pass through these little agencies until you got to understand what was happening in the business, unless you were really able to have a style strong enough to go directly to the publishers.","But generally speaking, people weren't fired, art jobs were very hard to get, so something really calamitous had to happen to a person who was working there in order for you to find a space.","But I was also a big mouth, I started to develop a troubled relationship with Harry Shorten.","I was not too smart and constantly mouthed off and didn't know anything.","I was hired to do as many Boy Commando, Newsboy Legion, and Sandman stories as I could.","DC used to print up all of their pages, they were the only company that did it.","First of all there was a guy named Charles Nicholas, who used to do all of the inking that Jack and Simon didn't do. Simon used to do splashes and covers, but Charles Nicholas, after a while, did the inside of all of the stuff.","Precision is not one of the qualities that comes out in my work.","I think the lack of precision and deep focus is why it took me years to build up my work.","Everything was sensory and I never saw the structure in anything.","I just saw the emotion in everything, so I got to feel everything that was going on and that I was viewing, but I couldn't think in terms of structure, which is the whole point of deep focus.","Comics were going down for the second time and here, all of a sudden, came this thing and for the next fifteen years, romance comics were about the top sellers in the field; they outsold everything.","Most of us came out of Popeye, so turning Popeye into something believable was tricky enough.","If I had one quality that really ruined me and at the same time helped me, it was the fact that I never stopped looking, and by that time I was really working at it."],"Gil Marks":["In Judaism, almost every ritual entails either food or the absence of food. Yom Kippur, for instance, is the absence of food. Part of it is Talmudic, part of it is custom. So much of Judaism was bound up in dietary laws. So everything you ate - the very act itself - was part of religion.","The Passover experience is an incredibly pedagogic one.","Most of the traditional foods we eat on Jewish holidays start out with a seasonal reason as to why we eat them, and later a religious significance is tacked on.","Passover is the most widely observed of all the Jewish holidays, and the Passover Seder... is the most practiced of all the Jewish rituals.","Food is never static; culture is never static.","If I'm doing an olive oil tasting, I would do a very lean bread: an Italian style or pita bread. You want the flavor of the oil to shine; you don't want the bread or anything else to mask it.","The knish is a classic example of peasant food evolving into comfort food and even sophisticated fare.","Although I generally avoid the cloyingly sweet wines, I have used them for poaching fruit.","Each Passover, I prepare all sorts of fancy desserts for my family and friends, often experimenting with adaptations of sophisticated modern fare.","The more things you make from scratch, the less expensive and usually healthier and tastier.","I never serve a dessert on Passover that I would not serve the rest of the year.","One of the keys to Jewish culinary history is that the Jewish role was not so much innovation but transition and transformation.","Throughout history, particularly in the last 2,000 years, Jews have been key in adapting local foods to Jewish sensibilities and dietary laws and then spreading them.","The key to Judaism's survival is the emotional attachment to the religion.","Food is sort of like the Jewish sense of humor, a defense mechanism. It is one of the things that helped the Jews survive through 2,000 years of an often very harsh Diaspora.","To know a community is to know its food.","A Jewish food is one that is almost sanctified, either by its repeated use or use within the holidays or rituals. So food that may have not been Jewish at one point can become Jewish within the cultural context.","Judaism is not just a religion but a people, and the food and customs of one part of the people is connected to the other part of the people. They are part of a larger story.","I have been collecting recipes and information for over 20 years, but three years ago, my editor said to me, 'You're a walking encyclopedia of food, so why don't you do an encyclopedia?'","Every holiday has unique fare and symbolic foods, but none as much as Rosh Hashana.","To me, that aspect of life that most touches the everyday and celebrations is food.","I don't understand a mentality that will accept eating something that doesn't taste good just because it's low-fat or is made with matzo or whatever.","I tend to avoid cakes made with matzo meal instead of flour. Also, most prepared dessert products and mixes. Sometimes the packaging they come in tastes better than the product.","Every year, my father comes by and samples the chremslach - like quality control - and tells me how they taste just like his mother's.","My family is notorious for its sweet tooth.","Throughout history, Hanukkah was a relatively minor festival, but it's become very popular in America due to its proximity to Christmas.","In the New York metropolitan area, you can find Jews from just about every Jewish cultural community in the world.","People remember the different variations of stuffed cabbage based on their mothers and grandmothers. It's not just about food. Eating something as traditional as this is a cultural experience, one that is spiritual and nostalgic. It manages to transcend time; it's food for the soul.","Sephardic Jews were always known as good cooks.","Preparing foods from other Jewish communities is broadening. It's interesting to sample the foods of other Jewish communities and see what they developed.","The kosher community tends to follow often several years behind the general societal trends.","There is a biblical injunction to tell your children, but the sages who created the Seder several thousand years ago understood that it had to be more than just speaking: that in order for something to connect so emotionally in human beings, it had to be relived.","We can all be defined by food.","Judaism is not, per se, a religion in the sense most Americans think of. Even if you don't adhere to the various precepts, you're still a Jew.","The processing and preparation of food can transform a kosher item into a non-kosher item."],"Gil Penchina":["Momentum begets momentum, and the best way to start is to start.","Ethereum is enabling a new form of financing in ICOs that is like a massive gravitational pull - dragging every entrepreneur with a sense for opportunity into its blackhole-level gravity.","Mobile was Internet 2.0. It changed everything. Crypto is Internet 3.0.","For merchants, it is an amazing opportunity. Compared to Paypal, crypto has no credit card fees, no charge backs, no 'Oops, we decided to hold your cash for 3-12 months while we investigate something we can't disclose.'","You're under tremendous pressure, and everyone needs you to be perfect all the time, and that often creates a perverse incentive to not tell the truth. Please remember - when you get caught not telling the truth, it's over.","Crypto today is a libertarian paradise. If you send your money to the wrong place, it's gone. If you send it to a merchant and don't receive the goods, you have no recourse. This is cash. Treat it as such.","All I do is talk to people, email people, take meetings with people, and do interviews. Then I work at maintaining relationships with my investors because the trust people place in me is my business model.","Now you can create your own Q&A site and be recognized as an expert on any topic you're passionate about in a way that is fast and easier than starting a new website.","In the U.S., Wikia has content sponsorships with top brands, including Blizzard Activision, Sony, Microsoft, Electronic Arts, ABC Television and others.","It's clear to me now that Ethereum is the new currency of the Internet. It's way ahead of where Paypal was in its day, and it's much more exciting to its customers than Paypal ever was.","I started angel investing because I like hanging out with entrepreneurs.","Whether someone wants to learn the words to a new Lady Gaga song they heard on the radio or to verify the lyrics to 'Blinded by the Light', the LyricWiki community delivers.","It is obvious that the Internet has become such a video-driven entity. With broadband becoming ubiquitous, viewers and advertisers are looking for professional-quality videos.","Buying a banner, you have no control whether ten different people see your ad once, or one person sees it ten times.","I've been lucky enough to be involved in a number of great startups, including eBay and Wikia as an entrepreneur and LinkedIn and Paypal as an investor.","When trying to start a company, your enemy isn't criticism, anger or insults. Your enemy is apathy.","Along the way, I learned the key to launching a company. It's all about storytelling.","When I first started as an angel investor, I was excited to start investing in startups - but I didn't know much. I couldn't tell the good ones from the bad; I didn't understand all these venture capital terms, so I would invest somewhat blindly.","Any ICO going forward that doesn't use a 'Ticketmaster-style' queueing engine is clearly trying to ruin the ecosystem.","When I participate in a Series A deal with VCs, entrepreneur-friendly terms go out the window. VCs remain attached to age-old traditional industry terms. 'Ratchet,' 'carry,' 'vetoes' - you name it.","While seed deals have gotten easy, Series A negotiations still often feel like the death of 1,000 cuts.","Startups are all about breaking the rules and changing the 'natural order' of things. So let's do that for Series A terms.","I was one of the early folks at eBay, and by 1999, it was completely overrun by consultants from McKinsey, Bain, and BCG. It went from being a cool, fun startup to an MBA factory.","There are lot of ways people get non-economic payback - learning, networking, and relationships. These drive most angels more than the money.","A mistake I've made is investing in my idea rather than the entrepreneur's. Sometimes I'm excited about an idea that is similar to the entrepreneur's idea - but not the same. A smart entrepreneur will convince me it is the same, until I write a check!","Focus. It's powerful to do just one thing and pour all your energy into it."],"Gil Scott-Heron":["You know what has made me the happiest I've ever been? Seeing my son and daughter graduate from college. More than wanting them to be educated, I wanted them to be nice people. To see that they have become both is just a wonderful thing.","Music has the power to make me feel good like nothing else does. It gives me some peace for a while. Takes me back to who I really am.","Our accomplishments show what kind of people we are.","If you aren't having no fun, die, because you're running a worthless program, far as I'm concerned.","If someone comes to you and asks for help, and you can help them, you're supposed to help them. Why wouldn't you? You have been put in the position somehow to be able to help this person.","You see, revolution sounds like something that happens, like turning on the light switch, but actually it's moving a large obstacle, and a lot of folks' efforts to push it in one direction or the other have to combine.","The way you get to know yourself is by the expressions on other people's faces, because that's the only thing that you can see, unless you carry a mirror about.","Colour is not the issue in America; class is.","The revolution that takes place in your head, nobody will ever see that.","I've always had questions about what it meant to be a protester, to be in the minority. Are the people who are trying to find peace, who are trying to have the Constitution apply to everybody, are they really the radicals? We're not protesting from the outside. We're inside.","As for money - when I have it, it's great. When I don't, I go get some. I've been a dishwasher, a gardener, a cleaner.","I thought that some of my best records was when there wasn't a lot of work being done on it, like 'Winter in America' and 'Secrets' and when there weren't a whole lot of people in the studios.","I was born in Chicago, but I was raised in a town called Jackson, Tennessee. And a lot of these changes that were necessary and talked about it as important have been made, like, people go to school where they want to go. They work for equal pay, they work for - they can go school and have an equal shot at a job.","My songs were always about the tone of voice rather than the words.","I am honestly not sure how capable I am of love. And I'm not sure why.","If you're supposed to be doing something, the spirits will come and help you. They have helped me out with lines I shouldn't have known, chords I shouldn't have known. Every once in a while I get lines from somewhere, and I think, I better write this down.","Every once in a while, you live long enough to get the respect that people didn't want to give while you were trying to become a senior citizen.","You have to learn and keep learning.","I don't mind being criticized. I enjoy being criticized personally, not by rumor.","Everything that's bad for you catches on too quickly in America, because that's the easiest thing to get people to invest in, the pursuits that are easy and destructive, the ones that bring out the least positive aspects of people.","I learnt early on that your audience take the songs in the way they want to rather than the way you might want them too.","Well, I grew up on the blues, man!","Schedule? I have no schedule. There is no hurry. I work when I want to.","Every show that sells out is like a hero's welcome for me.","Your life has to consist of more than 'Black people should unite.' You hope they do, but not twenty-four hours a day.","I was a piano player before I was a poet.","I was one of the first three black students to go to an all-white school in Tennessee.","I was a better writer when I was teaching. I was constantly going over the basics and constantly reminding myself, as I reminded my students, what made a good story, a good poem.","I tour more than I need to, more than is good for you. But it's my favorite part of music. I much prefer it to studio work.","You should be able to do anything you can afford as an adult.","I cannot afford to watch Fox News.","I found my grandmother dead. It shook me up. I got up to make her breakfast, and I knew it was strange that she wasn't stirring. I went in to wake her, and she was laying in rigor mortis, and I'm done. I called next door, and the kid picked up the phone, and I was so wild, he dropped it.","I have a novel that I can write. It's about three soldiers from Somalia. Some babies have been disappearing up on 144th Street, and I speculate later on what happened to them and how they might have been got back. These guys are dead, all three, and they have a chance in the afterlife to do something they should have done when they were alive.","Womenfolk raised me, and I was full-grown before I knew I came from a broken home."],"Gilbert Baker":["The rainbow is a part of nature, and you have to be in the right place to see it. It's beautiful, all of the colors, even the colors you can't see. That really fit us as a people because we are all of the colors. Our sexuality is all of the colors. We are all the genders, races, and ages.","We needed something to express our joy, our beauty, our power. And the rainbow did that.","What the rainbow has given our people is a thing that connects us.","A true flag is not something you can really design. A true flag is torn from the soul of the people. A flag is something that everyone owns, and that's why they work. The Rainbow Flag is like other flags in that sense: it belongs to the people.","The rainbow flag is a symbol of freedom and liberation that we made for ourselves.","I came out because I fell in love. It wasn't a terrible, horrible, damn thing. I was in love with somebody, and I wanted to scream it from the rooftops.","You don't have to live a lie. Living a lie will mess you up. It will send you into depression. It will warp your values.","In 1978, when I thought of creating a flag for the gay movement, there was no other international symbol for us than the pink triangle, which the Nazis used to identify homosexuals in concentration camps. Even though the pink triangle was and still is a powerful symbol, it was very much forced upon us.","It's not so easy to be gay or even a woman in some places in the world, and in many countries, it's illegal to be gay. You can be put to death. It's a global struggle. A human rights struggle on a global scale.","Flags are about proclaiming power... that visibility is key to our success and to our justice.","When I was young, they thought I was from outer space. I was the only gay person they probably knew, and they struggled with that. Everybody knew I was gay. They just didn't want to talk about it.","The rainbow flag is beautiful because it's about love. The Confederate flag is ugly because it's about hate. It's pretty simple from the art level: beautiful versus ugly.","A rainbow is something in the sky, so a rainbow flag fits.","I was astounded nobody had thought of making a rainbow flag before because it seemed like such an obvious symbol for us.","Harvey Milk was a friend of mine, an important gay leader in San Francisco in the '70s, and he carried a really important message about how important it was to be visible, how important it was to come out, and that was the single most important thing we had to do.","I think the Rainbow Flag will survive forever, primarily because it's the perfect flag, regardless of whatever political meaning it may have or evolve to.","I decided that we should have a flag, that a flag fit us as a symbol, that we are a people, a tribe if you will. And flags are about proclaiming power, so it's very appropriate.","A flag translates into everything, from tacky souvenirs to the names of organizations and the way that flags function.","Being gay in San Francisco is fun. Being gay in Saudi Arabia - that's a whole other matter.","The reason the rainbow flag endures is because people own it. It means something to them.","Flags say something. You put a rainbow flag on your windshield, and you're saying something.","Vexillography is a very big word! Vexillography is really the high science and art and understanding of flags and their history - the academic word for flag making and heraldry.","Our job as gay people was to come out, to be visible - to live in the truth, as I say - to get out of the lie.","Anita Bryant is an important figure in gay history because she enraged a generation of people who got active.","Anita Bryant had the effect of galvanizing the whole gay movement. She was somebody whom everybody could hate. She was easy to hate.","I was afraid my family would lock me up and give me electroshock. I was a screaming queen.","My parents and I didn't speak for 10 years. It took a long time to rebuild that relationship.","That's really how I ended up making the first flag - I was the guy who could sew it.","I love going to cities around the world and seeing the rainbow flag, knowing that it's a safe place where I can be myself.","When I fell in love, all the shame and guilt I carried with me for years suddenly vanished.","Once I was finally liberated from my Kansas background, the first thing I did was get a sewing machine, because it's 1972, and I have to look like Mick Jagger and David Bowie every single second. Taffeta jumpsuits.","In 1978, the first flag was organic everything. It did have eight colors: the six colors of the rainbow we see today plus hot pink and turquoise. But pretty quickly on I realized that I would never be able to satisfy the demand for them by hand-dying fabric and these colors.","Our movement is evolving. The movement to liberate our sexuality as a human right, that's an ongoing struggle."],"Gilbert Gottfried":["I have always felt comedy and tragedy are roommates. If you look up comedy and tragedy, you will find a very old picture of two masks. One mask is tragedy. It looks like it's crying. The other mask is comedy. It looks like it's laughing. Nowadays, we would say, 'How tasteless and insensitive. A comedy mask is laughing at a tragedy mask.'","You never know what people will choose to be offended by.","I can't even find someone for a platonic relationship, much less the kind where someone wants to see me naked.","I'm terrible when I have to fill up free time. My days, if I'm not working, I wake up and figure out a way to kill time until it's time to go to sleep.","I always try to avoid anything that has to do with my life.","I'm one of those people, in any country I'm in, if somebody could just put me in a car or a bus, I'll look out the window and say, 'OK, there's the Tower of London, there's Buckingham Palace, there's Big Ben,' and if it all takes about five minutes, perfect. I've seen all of it and I can go home.","I always wish the hotels were like they are in movies and TV shows, where if you're in Paris, right outside your window is the Eiffel Tower. In Egypt, the pyramids are right there. In the movies, every hotel has a monument right outside your window. My hotel rooms overlook the garbage dumpster in the back alley.","A landlord is showing a couple around an apartment. The husband looks up and says, 'Wait a minute. This apartment doesn't have a ceiling.' The landlord answers, 'That's OK. The people upstairs don't walk around that much.'","I wanted to be a brain surgeon, but I had a bad habit of dropping things.","I was the class podiatrist. I never made it to class clown. I wasn't funny enough. I would examine feet and prescribe and ointment. It was a sad childhood.","No, generally I think influence is used as a nice word for plagiarism.","If you're a lead actor, people are just waiting to say 'you're too old' or 'you're too unhip.' If you're a supporting actor, you can just work forever.","If someone else is paying for it, food just tastes a lot better.","I was Jewish, through and through, although in our house that didn't mean a whole lot. We never went to synagogue. I never had a Bar Mitzvah. We didn't keep kosher or observe the Sabbath. In fact, I'm not so sure I would have known what the Sabbath looked like if it passed me on the street, so how could I observe it?","I understand being less sexy than Osama bin Laden, but not less sexy than Carrot Top. That, I find offensive.","There are certain things I don't want to joke about. If it's about somebody else, it's fine. If it's about me, I think it's totally insensitive!","Every time I give a straight answer and read it in a magazine, I say, 'Ouch.' One day I'd like to talk to a psychoanalyst about why celebrities reveal so much of themselves in interviews.","I just don't accept midgets as human beings. There's only so much political correctness I can accept.","I'm one of those people that picks up the remote control and just keep hitting constantly, even if I like the show I'm watching.","I predict one of these two teams will win the Super Bowl.","With me, traveling for work is arriving at the airport, checking into the hotel, leaving the hotel the next morning at 4 or 5 to do something like 'The Jimmy and Jackie Captain Crazy Morning Zoo,' doing a bunch of those in a row, then going back to the hotel, and then finally going to the club.","The pressure to being a comedian is being funny, but I've given that up, so there is no pressure whatsoever.","Well, I'm eventually gonna take the Daryl Hannah parts.","I've never been one of those who wanted to fill my calendar up 90 percent of the time.","Well, I play Jews and parrots. Parrots are how I've branched out.","Unfortunately, I've never been mistaken as Johnny Depp.","If the police ever try to pick me up, Michael Jackson told me I can hide out at his house.","In real life I'm a tall, blond Christian.","One thing I can take credit for, along with the rest of show business, is when the red ribbons were out, we cured AIDS. Any advancements that came towards fighting AIDS were not done by scientists or doctors - it was people with little ribbons on their lapels.","I don't know if I change my act from century to century. Sometimes I'm onstage doing imitations and references to people who have been dead for 50 years.","There definitely is exposure in reality shows, but the exposure will basically get you more reality shows.","I would show up at a party for Al Qaeda if you said there's going to be a dinner.","I'd make Jack Benny look like a philanthropist.","I'm used to explaining to people why my jokes were funny.","A lot of people who claim they're political comedians are just comedians who have opinions. But they stop being funny the minute they give their opinions.","I always feel that most political jokes, if you're going to do them, you have to do them within the next five minutes, or else they're outdated. By the time you've got it to the point that it's strong, it would be 12 years old.","I find Washington audiences are basically the same as every other audience; they watch me and go, 'Who's idea was it to go see him? And is it too late to ask for my money back?'","With the Internet, if you erase something it just means you have to spend another half-minute to find it.","Reality TV has totally destroyed soap operas. They're gone. They used to be the biggest thing in the world - they're gone.","Off-camera, I sound like Perry Como.","There are times when I've had ideas walking down the street that I thought were great, and the minute I got onstage, I would think of them and go, 'Wow, that would never work,' even before I did it in front of the audience.","I guess if they ever do a remake of 'Sophie's Choice,' I could play the Meryl Streep part. I've got to work on my Polish accent. Maybe I'll be the definitive King Lear one day. You know, if they ever feel that King Lear should be more Jewy.","Any misfortune that happens to another person is funny. If it happens to someone else and not me, it's very funny.","The joy of the roasts is to watch people get hurt and offended, and then have to laugh to pretend they're a good sport.","When you watch Robin Williams, you can see a lot of Jonathan Winters. Robin is the first one to admit that; he worshiped Jonathan Winters.","I found out about Jonathan Winters' death a day after it happened. That seems wrong. A talent like his should be more revered. The world knew about Kim Kardashian's divorce before she did.","If a comedian tells a joke that you find funny, you laugh. If he tells a joke you do not find funny, don't laugh. Or you could possibly go as far as groaning or rolling your eyes. Then you wait for his next joke; if that's funny, then you laugh. If it's not, you don't laugh - or at very worst, you can leave quietly.","Some comedians tell nice jokes that you can tell to your kids. Some use bad words - they work 'blue.' If you don't want to hear a joke that's blue, you shouldn't go to a comedy club where a comedian who makes blue jokes is performing.","My Bubbie lived to 104, which is probably a little too old to consider a ripe old age, because she had already started to turn. I still say she died young.","I've never understood people who say they're not a practicing Jew. You never hear a black guy say he's not a practicing African-American. What does it even mean?","Comedy historians take note: this Gottfried character doesn't have the best eye for detail - and, for a Jew, he doesn't have the best eye for retail, either.","Back when Jerry Seinfeld was just another comedian hanging around the clubs, I'd imitate him to amuse myself and the other comics. The club owners would say, 'What are you doing that for? Nobody knows him.'","I used to go to the Improvisation Comedy Club every night in Times Square. How I didn't get killed in that area either means that 1) God is watching over me or 2) I am so insignificant to God that he didn't bother having me killed.","My family originally lived in Brooklyn. Our first apartment was a little place above my father and uncle's hardware store in Coney Island. Now, don't get the impression that we were surrounded by merry-go-rounds, roller coasters and Ferris wheels. Nope, this was a little side street.","I'd like to have a kid, but I'd probably get a Frank Sinatra Jr. instead of a Gilbert Gottfried Jr. I'd totally screw up like that.","I think of Alan Thicke as Perry Como without the excitement.","I'm known for my slightly inappropriate remarks.","If I could cause world peace by taking someone out to lunch, I'd go, 'Well, war isn't that terrible.'","I remember being at the premiere of 'Beverly Hills Cop II' and the tremendous reaction from the crowd outside, then going to a party at a hotel afterwards where the speakers were blasting 'Shakedown,' a song from the movie. That felt like a show biz moment to me.","I'm a very anti-vacation person. Because I'm always getting on planes for work, to me, a vacation is when I don't have to get on a plane.","People have many theories about comedy, but being just plain funny is the one most important thing.","Nothing can help my comedy.","I think a lot of people have too much time on their hands.","The 'Phoenix Sun' did a list of the unsexiest men in the world, and I made it to number one. I beat out Bin Laden. He's a terrorist, hasn't bathed in months. I beat him out. To me it was a great honor.","I changed the face of comedy. I used to be funny."],"Gilbert Hernandez":["I think I related more literally to the early 'Spider-Man' comics from Steve Ditko because it could be upfront and direct about the problems of being a kid. He captured being a teenager so beautifully.","We grew out of the superhero comics, but we still liked comics, so we started putting our own experiences in the stories we were doing for our own amusement.","I always felt I was living in two worlds. One was the Mexican world, because nearly everybody I knew, relatives and cousins and kids in the neighbourhood, were Mexican. Then school was a different world. It was ethnically mixed.","When you're young you don't know anything, but you have lot of energy to express yourself. So you make a lot of mistakes and you stumble, but you also get a lot of truth from within.","Dennis the Menace was probably the most realistic comic book ever done. No space aliens ever invaded!","I've sort of dealt with the characters' lives more; particularly the women characters.","It wasn't until school that we realised that we were abnormal.","My two biggest influences are Archie comics and Dennis the Menace.","Our father died when we were very young, so our mother raised six kids. We saw the world filtered through her eyes, being a minority woman raising six kids.","We thought everybody read comics. We didn't know we were weird. We didn't know people that collected comics were strange. It was as normal as listening to rock music on the radio.","We were very happy when a South African court, which had previously ruled against us, took another look and decided that this material was not obscene and allowed it into the country.","Reviewers and critics can be overly cynical. If something the least bit sentimental comes up, they'll often start flying off the handle. But I'm like, 'Wait a minute, you've had those times in your life. Everybody has.'","I had always shown childhood as something difficult, something you want to get the hell out of, but now I wanted to do a story that was the opposite, about that moment in time when you're in that world of discovery, doing what you want to do. That fleeting moment when you're in your zone.","I wanted to do pretty much a purely boy story, yes. The girls are kind of the bad guys in 'Marble Season', although that wasn't my intention. It's also a world without adults.","In the old days, I just could not leave characters alone. Now I just try to keep the ones that still have something in the way of stories to tell.","Whichever character I'm using and wherever I am in my mind dictates what kind of story I'm going to tell.","I felt like challenging myself and challenging my readers with something darker and heavier. I don't know how to explain it, because I'm not a political person. I have two political stories, and that's it: 'Human Diastrophism' and 'Poison River.'","It wasn't until I started to do 'Poison River' that the readership started falling. 'Poison River' started out very slowly and simply, but then it got really dense and complicated. I don't know, I think the readers just got fed up or burned out. They started dropping off.","I grew up when comics were only sold in food markets and news stands, so the direct market is vital to me. The best way to make it stronger is if everybody buys my comics in multiple copies before they buy any others.","I've dealt with Hollywood about having my work made into a film or cartoon but nothing came of it. That's not to say I wouldn't like to see something happen.","I happen to think Latinas, Latin women, are the most beautiful women in the world. So that's what I'm going to draw. I love women from all cultures, of course, but if I was going to deal with any of them, that would be No. 1 for me.","I grew up being really insecure and dumped on, over-feeling certain things in a negative way. So I thought I had something to prove.","I know what a good movie is.","For me, the reason to make the movie is that if people like the comic, then people would like the movie if it was well made. There are good movies for them, but very few. And I mean that in a true sense. If they love your story for freaking 30 years, then they can do a movie about it."],"Gilbert Highet":["A good teacher is a determined person.","The relation between parents and children is essentially based on teaching.","A teacher must believe in the value and interest of his subject as a doctor believes in health.","Language is a living thing. We can feel it changing. Parts of it become old: they drop off and are forgotten. New pieces bud out, spread into leaves, and become big branches, proliferating.","These are not books, lumps of lifeless paper, but minds alive on the shelves.","The real duty of man is not to extend his power or multiply his wealth beyond his needs, but to enrich and enjoy his imperishable possession: his soul.","What is politics but persuading the public to vote for this and support that and endure these for the promise of those?","Many people have played themselves to death. Many people have eaten and drunk themselves to death. Nobody ever thought himself to death."],"Gilbert K. Chesterton":["There are no rules of architecture for a castle in the clouds.","To love means loving the unlovable. To forgive means pardoning the unpardonable. Faith means believing the unbelievable. Hope means hoping when everything seems hopeless.","And when it rains on your parade, look up rather than down. Without the rain, there would be no rainbow.","The traveler sees what he sees, the tourist sees what he has come to see.","The only way to be sure of catching a train is to miss the one before it.","One sees great things from the valley; only small things from the peak.","The Christian ideal has not been tried and found wanting. It has been found difficult and left untried.","Let a man walk ten miles steadily on a hot summer's day along a dusty English road, and he will soon discover why beer was invented.","The true object of all human life is play. Earth is a task garden; heaven is a playground.","Art consists of limitation. The most beautiful part of every picture is the frame.","New roads; new ruts.","Tolerance is the virtue of the man without convictions.","A stiff apology is a second insult... The injured party does not want to be compensated because he has been wronged; he wants to be healed because he has been hurt.","When it comes to life the critical thing is whether you take things for granted or take them with gratitude.","Marriage is an adventure, like going to war.","All architecture is great architecture after sunset; perhaps architecture is really a nocturnal art, like the art of fireworks.","The way to love anything is to realize that it may be lost.","The poets have been mysteriously silent on the subject of cheese.","Man does not live by soap alone; and hygiene, or even health, is not much good unless you can take a healthy view of it or, better still, feel a healthy indifference to it.","An inconvenience is an adventure wrongly considered.","Youth is the period in which a man can be hopeless. The end of every episode is the end of the world. But the power of hoping through everything, the knowledge that the soul survives its adventures, that great inspiration comes to the middle-aged.","To be clever enough to get all that money, one must be stupid enough to want it.","It isn't that they can't see the solution. It is that they can't see the problem.","There is a road from the eye to heart that does not go through the intellect.","The aim of life is appreciation; there is no sense in not appreciating things; and there is no sense in having more of them if you have less appreciation of them.","How you think when you lose determines how long it will be until you win.","Christianity has not been tried and found wanting; it has been found difficult and not tried.","The Bible tells us to love our neighbors, and also to love our enemies; probably because generally they are the same people.","Journalism largely consists of saying 'Lord Jones is Dead' to people who never knew that Lord Jones was alive.","I've searched all the parks in all the cities and found no statues of committees.","The word 'good' has many meanings. For example, if a man were to shoot his grandmother at a range of five hundred yards, I should call him a good shot, but not necessarily a good man.","Let your religion be less of a theory and more of a love affair.","A yawn is a silent shout.","Love means to love that which is unlovable; or it is no virtue at all.","'My country, right or wrong' is a thing no patriot would ever think of saying except in a desperate case. It is like saying 'My mother, drunk or sober.'","People generally quarrel because they cannot argue.","Lying in bed would be an altogether perfect and supreme experience if only one had a colored pencil long enough to draw on the ceiling.","All slang is metaphor, and all metaphor is poetry.","A puritan is a person who pours righteous indignation into the wrong things.","Education is simply the soul of a society as it passes from one generation to another.","The perplexity of life arises from there being too many interesting things in it for us to be interested properly in any of them.","Science in the modern world has many uses; its chief use, however, is to provide long words to cover the errors of the rich.","The most dangerous criminal now is the entirely lawless modern philosopher. Compared to him, burglars and bigamists are essentially moral men.","Man is an exception, whatever else he is. If he is not the image of God, then he is a disease of the dust. If it is not true that a divine being fell, then we can only say that one of the animals went entirely off its head.","People who make history know nothing about history. You can see that in the sort of history they make.","The only defensible war is a war of defense.","True contentment is a thing as active as agriculture. It is the power of getting out of any situation all that there is in it. It is arduous and it is rare.","Artistic temperament is the disease that afflicts amateurs.","If I can put one touch of rosy sunset into the life of any man or woman, I shall feel that I have worked with God.","Do not free a camel of the burden of his hump; you may be freeing him from being a camel.","The object of a New Year is not that we should have a new year. It is that we should have a new soul and a new nose; new feet, a new backbone, new ears, and new eyes. Unless a particular man made New Year resolutions, he would make no resolutions. Unless a man starts afresh about things, he will certainly do nothing effective.","Thieves respect property. They merely wish the property to become their property that they may more perfectly respect it.","Men always talk about the most important things to perfect strangers. In the perfect stranger we perceive man himself; the image of a God is not disguised by resemblances to an uncle or doubts of wisdom of a mustache.","What people call impartiality may simply mean indifference, and what people call partiality may simply mean mental activity.","Tradition means giving votes to the most obscure of all classes, our ancestors. It is the democracy of the dead. Tradition refuses to submit to that arrogant oligarchy who merely happen to be walking around.","There is nothing the matter with Americans except their ideals. The real American is all right; it is the ideal American who is all wrong.","The simplification of anything is always sensational.","Courage is almost a contradiction in terms. It means a strong desire to live taking the form of readiness to die.","We make our friends; we make our enemies; but God makes our next door neighbour.","I owe my success to having listened respectfully to the very best advice, and then going away and doing the exact opposite.","Men feel that cruelty to the poor is a kind of cruelty to animals. They never feel that it is an injustice to equals; nay it is treachery to comrades.","Those thinkers who cannot believe in any gods often assert that the love of humanity would be in itself sufficient for them; and so, perhaps, it would, if they had it.","Being 'contented' ought to mean in English, as it does in French, being pleased. Being content with an attic ought not to mean being unable to move from it and resigned to living in it; it ought to mean appreciating all there is in such a position.","We are justified in enforcing good morals, for they belong to all mankind; but we are not justified in enforcing good manners, for good manners always mean our own manners.","If a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing badly.","Coincidences are spiritual puns.","Brave men are all vertebrates; they have their softness on the surface and their toughness in the middle.","A good novel tells us the truth about its hero; but a bad novel tells us the truth about its author.","I would maintain that thanks are the highest form of thought, and that gratitude is happiness doubled by wonder.","Without education we are in a horrible and deadly danger of taking educated people seriously.","You can never have a revolution in order to establish a democracy. You must have a democracy in order to have a revolution.","The purpose of Compulsory Education is to deprive the common people of their commonsense.","A businessman is the only man who is forever apologizing for his occupation.","Democracy means government by the uneducated, while aristocracy means government by the badly educated.","I regard golf as an expensive way of playing marbles.","Art, like morality, consists in drawing the line somewhere.","Literature is a luxury; fiction is a necessity.","There is a great deal of difference between an eager man who wants to read a book and the tired man who wants a book to read.","The trouble with always trying to preserve the health of the body is that it is so difficult to do without destroying the health of the mind.","All conservatism is based upon the idea that if you leave things alone you leave them as they are. But you do not. If you leave a thing alone you leave it to a torrent of change.","The honest poor can sometimes forget poverty. The honest rich can never forget it.","A man does not know what he is saying until he knows what he is not saying.","The man who throws a bomb is an artist, because he prefers a great moment to everything.","Happy is he who still loves something he loved in the nursery: He has not been broken in two by time; he is not two men, but one, and he has saved not only his soul but his life.","The vulgar man is always the most distinguished, for the very desire to be distinguished is vulgar.","Man seems to be capable of great virtues but not of small virtues; capable of defying his torturer but not of keeping his temper.","Fable is more historical than fact, because fact tells us about one man and fable tells us about a million men.","We call a man a bigot or a slave of dogma because he is a thinker who has thought thoroughly and to a definite end.","A teacher who is not dogmatic is simply a teacher who is not teaching.","Education is the period during which you are being instructed by somebody you do not know, about something you do not want to know.","The fatal metaphor of progress, which means leaving things behind us, has utterly obscured the real idea of growth, which means leaving things inside us.","Journalism is popular, but it is popular mainly as fiction. Life is one world, and life seen in the newspapers is another.","No man who worships education has got the best out of education... Without a gentle contempt for education no man's education is complete.","The whole object of travel is not to set foot on foreign land; it is at last to set foot on one's own country as a foreign land.","I do not believe in a fate that falls on men however they act; but I do believe in a fate that falls on them unless they act.","Drink because you are happy, but never because you are miserable.","The object of opening the mind, as of opening the mouth, is to shut it again on something solid.","Compromise used to mean that half a loaf was better than no bread. Among modern statesmen it really seems to mean that half a loaf; is better than a whole loaf.","Half a truth is better than no politics.","Some men never feel small, but these are the few men who are.","An adventure is only an inconvenience rightly considered. An inconvenience is only an adventure wrongly considered.","The mere brute pleasure of reading the sort of pleasure a cow must have in grazing.","A new philosophy generally means in practice the praise of some old vice.","The family is the test of freedom; because the family is the only thing that the free man makes for himself and by himself.","Buddhism is not a creed, it is a doubt.","The poor have sometimes objected to being governed badly; the rich have always objected to being governed at all.","Women prefer to talk in twos, while men prefer to talk in threes.","The present condition of fame is merely fashion.","The paradox of courage is that a man must be a little careless of his life even in order to keep it.","The ordinary scientific man is strictly a sentimentalist. He is a sentimentalist in this essential sense, that he is soaked and swept away by mere associations.","Music with dinner is an insult both to the cook and the violinist.","One may understand the cosmos, but never the ego; the self is more distant than any star.","I was planning to go into architecture. But when I arrived, architecture was filled up. Acting was right next to it, so I signed up for acting instead.","Large organization is loose organization. Nay, it would be almost as true to say that organization is always disorganization.","There is but an inch of difference between a cushioned chamber and a padded cell.","The whole order of things is as outrageous as any miracle which could presume to violate it.","Never invoke the gods unless you really want them to appear. It annoys them very much.","White... is not a mere absence of colour; it is a shining and affirmative thing, as fierce as red, as definite as black... God paints in many colours; but He never paints so gorgeously, I had almost said so gaudily, as when He paints in white.","Cruelty is, perhaps, the worst kid of sin. Intellectual cruelty is certainly the worst kind of cruelty.","It is not funny that anything else should fall down; only that a man should fall down. Why do we laugh? Because it is a gravely religious matter: it is the Fall of Man. Only man can be absurd: for only man can be dignified.","Experience which was once claimed by the aged is now claimed exclusively by the young.","The cosmos is about the smallest hole that a man can hide his head in.","With any recovery from morbidity there must go a certain healthy humiliation.","It is as healthy to enjoy sentiment as to enjoy jam.","A woman uses her intelligence to find reasons to support her intuition.","Nothing is poetical if plain daylight is not poetical; and no monster should amaze us if the normal man does not amaze.","If I had only one sermon to preach it would be a sermon against pride.","Once I planned to write a book of poems entirely about the things in my pocket. But I found it would be too long; and the age of the great epics is past.","When we were children we were grateful to those who filled our stockings at Christmas time. Why are we not grateful to God for filling our stockings with legs?","It is the test of a good religion whether you can joke about it.","There is no such thing on earth as an uninteresting subject; the only thing that can exist is an uninterested person.","In matters of truth the fact that you don't want to publish something is, nine times out of ten, a proof that you ought to publish it.","And they that rule in England, in stately conclaves met, alas, alas for England they have no graves as yet.","A man who says that no patriot should attack the war until it is over... is saying no good son should warn his mother of a cliff until she has fallen.","A radical generally meant a man who thought he could somehow pull up the root without affecting the flower. A conservative generally meant a man who wanted to conserve everything except his own reason for conserving anything.","When we really worship anything, we love not only its clearness but its obscurity. We exult in its very invisibility.","If you do not understand a man you cannot crush him. And if you do understand him, very probably you will not.","The greenhorn is the ultimate victor in everything; it is he that gets the most out of life.","Happiness is a mystery, like religion, and should never be rationalised.","Ritual will always mean throwing away something: destroying our corn or wine upon the altar of our gods.","The only way of catching a train I have ever discovered is to miss the train before.","What affects men sharply about a foreign nation is not so much finding or not finding familiar things; it is rather not finding them in the familiar place.","Chastity does not mean abstention from sexual wrong; it means something flaming, like Joan of Arc."],"Gilbert Morris":["When people find out that I've written 208 novels, they ask, 'How did you think of all that?' Well, I answer, 'How do you not think of it?' I see a gum wrapper on the ground, and I think, 'Oh, a Russian spy probably dropped that.' I just think like that, and those thoughts go through my mind constantly.","You write five different things, and none of them work, and then suddenly something does, and you ask yourself, 'Why did that last one work?' I think that's the way the artistic mind works. All writers and artists of all kinds often don't know why things work.","Nobody sits down and says, 'Well, I'm going to write a bad book.' They sit down to write a great book, but it doesn't always turn out like that. The writer may do his best and still write a so-so book, and other times, it just flows easily. But I don't know how you can control that.","If you go wrong in a novel, you can straighten it out in the next chapter. You don't have any room to do that in a novella."],"Gilbert Murray":["The life and liberty and property and happiness of the common man throughout the world are at the absolute mercy of a few persons whom he has never seen, involved in complicated quarrels that he has never heard of.","The fact is that much misunderstanding is often caused by our modern attempts to limit too strictly the meaning of a Greek word.","It is doubtless one of Aristotle's great services that he conceived so clearly the truth that literature is a thing that grows and has a history.","Be careful in dealing with a man who cares nothing for comfort or promotion, but is simply determined to do what he believes to be right. He is a dangerous uncomfortable enemy, because his body, which you can always conquer, gives you little purchase upon his soul.","Few of the great works of ancient Greek literature are easy reading.","The higher Greek poetry did not make up fictitious plots; its business was to express the heroic saga, the myths.","Sometimes Aristotle analyses his terms, but very often he takes them for granted; and in the latter case, I think, he is sometimes deceived by them.","Greek was very much a live language, and a language still unconscious of grammar, not, like ours, dominated by definitions and trained upon dictionaries.","The fashions of the ages vary in this direction and that, but they vary for the most part from a central road which was struck out by the imagination of Greece.","Where words can be translated into equivalent words, the style of an original can be closely followed; but no translation which aims at being written in normal English can reproduce the style of Aristotle."],"Gilbert Newton Lewis":["To inquire into the origin of life is like seeking the origin of electrical machinery or the origin of music. Every increase in complexity of arrangement, of form, of substance, leads to new and often incalculable properties.","We frequently define an acid or a base as a substance whose aqueous solution gives, respectively, a higher concentration of hydrogen ion or of hydroxide ion than that furnished by pure water. This is a very one sided definition.","In the snobbery of science, each branch attempts to rise in the social scale by imitating the methods of the next higher science and by ignoring the methods and phenomena of the sciences beneath.","Sometimes I think that our laboratories are but little earthworks which men build about themselves, and whose puny tops too often conceal from view the Olympian heights; that we who work in these laboratories are but skilled artisans compared with the man who is able to observe and to draw accurate deductions from the world about him.","It must be admitted that science has its castes. The man whose chief apparatus is the differential equation looks down upon one who uses a galvanometer, and he in turn upon those who putter about with sticky and smelly things in test tubes.","Since hydrogen is a constituent of most of our electrolytic solvents, the definition of an acid or base as a substance which gives up or takes up hydrogen ion would be more general than the one we used before, but it would not be universal.","We may say that a basic substance is one which has a lone pair of electrons which may be used to complete the stable group of another atom, and that an acid is one which can employ a lone pair from another molecule in completing the stable group of one of its own atoms."],"Gilbert Parker":["There is no influence like the influence of habit.","Love knows not distance; it hath no continent; its eyes are for the stars.","It is not the broken heart that kills, but broken pride, monseigneur.","For when a child is born the mother also is born again.","There is no refuge from memory and remorse in this world. The spirits of our foolish deeds haunt us, with or without repentance.","It's the people who try to be clever who never are; the people who are clever never think of trying to be.","In all secrets there is a kind of guilt, however beautiful or joyful they may be, or for what good end they may be set to serve. Secrecy means evasion, and evasion means a problem to the moral mind.","Memory is man's greatest friend and worst enemy.","The real business of life is trying to understand each other.","Imagination is at the root of much that passes for love.","Nothing is so unproductive as the law. It is expensive whether you win or lose.","Every shot that kills ricochets.","She belongs to a race of delightful women, who never do any harm, whom everybody calls good, and who are very severe on those who do not pretend to be good.","It must be remembered that the sea is a great breeder of friendship. Two men who have known each other for twenty years find that twenty days at sea bring them nearer than ever they were before, or else estrange them.","Every man should have laws of his own, I should think; commandments of his own, for every man has a different set of circumstances wherein to work - or worry.","Man is born in a day, and he dies in a day, and the thing is easily over; but to have a sick heart for three-fourths of one's lifetime is simply to have death renewed every morning; and life at that price is not worth living.","He came by a leap to the goal of purpose, not by the toilsome steps of reason. On the instant his headlong spirit declared his purpose: this was the one being for him in all the world: at this altar he would light a lamp of devotion, and keep it burning forever.","But paying is part of the game of life: it is the joy of buying that we crave.","He knew the lie of silence to be as evil as the lie of speech.","War is cruelty, and none can make it gentle.","There's no credit in not doing what you don't want to do. There's no virtue in not falling, when you're not tempted.","Tomorrow is no man's gift."],"Gilbert White":["Bats drink on the wing, like swallows, by sipping the surface, as they play over pools and streams.","Though large herds of deer do much harm to the neighbourhood, yet the injury to the morals of the people is of more moment than the loss of their crops.","I was much entertained last summer with a tame bat, which would take flies out of a person's hand.","The parish I live in is a very abrupt, uneven country, full of hills and woods, and therefore full of birds.","It is, I find, in zoology as it is in botany: all nature is so full, that that district produces the greatest variety which is the most examined.","General Howe turned out some German wild boars and sows in his forests, to the great terror of the neighbourhood; and, at one time, a wild bull or buffalo: but the country rose upon them and destroyed them.","Hedge-hogs abound in my gardens and fields.","I want to be better informed with regard to ichthyology.","Numbers of snipes breed every summer in some moory ground on the verge of this parish.","The French, I think, in general, are strangely prolix in their natural history.","The parish of Selborne, by taking in so much of the forest, is a vast district.","We have had a very severe frost and deep snow this month. My thermometer was one day fourteen degrees and a half below the freezing point, within doors.","You may depend on it that the bunting, emberiza miliaria, does not leave this country in the winter."],"Gilda Radner":["Life is about not knowing, having to change, taking the moment and making the best of it, without knowing what's going to happen next.","I think dogs are the most amazing creatures; they give unconditional love. For me, they are the role model for being alive.","I can always be distracted by love, but eventually I get horny for my creativity.","The goal is to live a full, productive life even with all that ambiguity. No matter what happens, whether the cancer never flares up again or whether you die, the important thing is that the days that you have had you will have lived.","In our show we know, if we're not getting a response, you see it in our face... we either do something to get a laugh, or the audience is in on it with us.","You feel completely in control when you hear a wave of laughter coming back at you that you have caused.","Some stories don't have a clear beginning, middle and end.","While we have the gift of life, it seems to me the only tragedy is to allow part of us to die - whether it is our spirit, our creativity or our glorious uniqueness.","Fame changes a lot of things, but it can't change a lightbulb.","Having cancer gave me membership in an elite club I'd rather not belong to.","I base most of my fashion taste on what doesn't itch.","I grew up in front of a television. I guess I'll grow old inside of one.","Dreams are like paper, they tear so easily.","There is no real security except for whatever you build inside yourself.","My father had a hotel, and people in show business used to stay there. He loved peformers and entertainment, and I grew up knowing that.","I'd much rather be a woman than a man. Women can cry, they can wear cute clothes, and they're the first to be rescued off sinking ships.","I'm so full I can't hear.","When the journalists asked Gene, 'Why didn't you marry the beautiful girl in 'The Woman in Red'?' he would always reply, 'I did!'","Adopted kids are such a pain - you have to teach them how to look like you.","Comedy is very controlling - you are making people laugh.","I think clothes should make you feel safe. I like clothes you want to go to sleep in. I sometimes stand in front of a mirror and change a million times because I know I really want to wear my nightgown.","I would say that Lucy, 'I Love Lucy,' she was my idol.","I'm not really an impersonator.","I don't miss 'Saturday Night Live.' I feel less of a need for the fulfillment that performance used to give... I don't have to do everything right away. As long as I can walk and jump, I'll still perform, but I no longer feel such a compulsion.","Did I become an entertainer because my father died and I wanted to be what he loved? I don't know.","I had been a fan of Gene Wilder's for many years, but the first time I saw him in person, my heart fluttered - I was hooked. It felt like my life went from black and white to Technicolor.","Sportswriting is fascinating - descriptions of the opponents and the details of an event in which someone is going to win and someone is going to lose. Life is much longer and more complicated, and the outcomes are less clear-cut.","We were married in the south of France because Gene loved France. If he could have been born French, he would have been - that was his dream.","When Gene makes a movie, the people who work on it have such a love for him that the set is always a happy place."],"Giles Andreae":["Here is the tragedy: when you are the victim of depression, not only do you feel utterly helpless and abandoned by the world, you also know that very few people can understand, or even begin to believe, that life can be this painful. There is nothing I can think of that is quite as isolating as this.","If depression has taught me one thing, it is this: what a rare and beautiful treasure is the simple human gift of joy. For me now, joy - our capacity to delight in one another and in the world - is the reason why we are here. It is as simple as that. And I feel compelled to spread the word.","I'm not a fan of Dr. Seuss's better-known work, but his fables leave me awe-struck. 'Ten Tall Tales' is a collection of stories where his trademark anarchy is combined with a tautness of writing that shines an affectionate yet uncompromising spotlight on some of the absurdities of human behaviour.","Here is the tragedy: when you are the victim of depression, not only do you feel utterly helpless and abandoned by the world, you also know that very few people can understand, or even begin to believe, that life can be this painful.","Thinking you've had depression makes about as much sense as thinking you've been run over by a bus. Trust me - you know when you've got depression.","Trust me, you know when you've got depression.","Every year of my working life, I have been fortunate enough to earn more money than I have spent.","What's the function of poetry? It's to express general truths, to connect with the reader and make him think: 'Wow, I've experienced that, but you've expressed it so much better.'","At its best, Purple Ronnie puts little thoughts out there, on very high-volume selling items, that people use to make very personal connections with one another. And I'm actually very proud of that.","That is the real problem of depression - a condition which will affect an estimated one in five of the population at some point in their lives. It is completely unimaginable until you have been through it."],"Giles Deacon":["For me, green is more about cycling than recycling.","I really like doing good work and working with good people - that's the thing that drives me.","It can be refugees, it can be a pregnant mother, it can be a 15-year-old... homelessness can happen to everybody.","Anyone looking for a black cashmere sweater isn't going to come to me.","With all my clients I work with, they all have their absolute specialness about them.","Some things can be quite stupid yet interesting. Life can be like that.","DAKS is a much more restrained silhouette, and there's a real emphasis on daywear, outerwear, and tailoring. It's more stripped-down.","I didn't set out wanting to be a fashion designer from the age of 3. It wasn't that kind of dream.","I'd really love to dress Lauren Bacall. She's incredibly interesting - a gorgeous, stylish woman with a strong personality.","You take it very seriously when you start any project, but not everything in life ends up where you think it's going to be.","I think a bit of jewellery that cheers you up for the day isn't a bad thing.","I do like designing clothes that are - not exactly lofty but intellectual in their sexiness.","The customer who likes to be noticed is important to us.","Students are up to their eyeballs in loans, and it's going to get even worse. It's going to be hideous, actually. Students are going to be saddled for life. It's going to put a lot of people off going to college, which is a shame.","I don't believe in a recipe for success. You have to work hard; you may not always get it right - you have to bounce back from situations, and you have to be really focused and determined. It's important to have fun as well. Work shouldn't be a torture.","If a piece is individually made to measure, then it's couture.","My friends and I used to take two-hour trips to the record store in Newcastle, and we started buying copies of The Face and i-D. And then I went to art school, and as time progressed, I ended up where I am now.","I like characters in life, generally; I don't like to see a collection modelled on a homogeneous look. That terrifies me.","I like women to have life, personalities. Women who would perhaps cause some trouble on a night out and have a lot to say for themselves.","Rooney Mara is someone I'd like to dress; we've not worked with her before and she certainly has very interesting personal style.","If you've invested money in buying a piece, you don't want it to just disintegrate. We all have that first wash anxiety, when that great t-shirt you've just bought shrinks away to nothing.","With couture, the great thing is that each piece has its own character, and you have space to explore and continue themes season after season.","The name Holly Fulton has become synonymous with daring, bold graphic prints which you just know if you wear you'll have a brilliant time in.","I went to public and state schools - not at the same time. I did my art foundation course at Harrogate College of Arts. This brilliant tutor suggested I apply to Central Saint Martins. I adored it.","I don't really have a mentor.","My longest collaborative working relationship is with Katie Grand, the editor-in-chief of 'Love' magazine. Katie's an inspiration and a sounding block. She's got such great taste.","People often think that the world fashion is so full of a certain pretense that it can't just be about going for something because it suits you and looks great, and it's nicely cut and is made of beautiful fabric. You know, if it has a bit of lightness and playfulness to it, then I think people just respond to that really well.","Everybody's got a lot to their personalities. You're not just one element. There are some days you want something that can be a bit stricter or a bit more disciplined or something a bit more floaty and a bit freer.","Women I've known have always been quite strong and confident women. Sure, I've got some friends who aren't so overtly confident, or at least don't appear that way. But when you get to know them, they are very much so.","Making your own clothes is great - but don't make everything, or I'll be out of a job!","'Irony' is such an over-used word.","I liked the fact DAKS was an unknown quantity. It's more like Gucci before Tom Ford got there. There's a lot you can do.","I don't like acres of faceless girls walking.","I'm interested in women who have got character and experience and an opinion about things.","I love London. Wherever I've lived, I've always had my flat here.","I very much like Christopher Kane. He actually did a work placement with me, and you could spot his talent straight away.","Due to the hectic, non-stop nature of my work, I'm always using my BlackBerry to stay in touch with my studio, wherever I am.","The women that wear my clothes would want a pink BlackBerry in their handbag.","We want to be the go-to business for super-special daywear and eveningwear, to focus on what we are known for and what our customers want from us.","With couture, it means I get to show fall in July with delivery in September. My clients will be getting their pieces in season.","I did an art foundation course, and I knew I wanted to do something in a creative field. And fashion just seemed like the most fun.","I have an art-school background, not a fashion background where it's like, 'Oh, we're going on holiday to Miami.'","I go to contemporary galleries all around the world when I can. There's always something historical and something contemporary; those are my rock references.","It's important to offer well-thought-out pieces at lower prices.","I believe in the democracy of design.","I don't like po-faced fashion.","My parents weren't into fashion. I didn't have an eccentric granny who mixed lace mantillas with tweed.","I am more interested in people's attitude than someone who is a perfect face. Every time I walk the streets of London, I see someone who interests me. It doesn't matter how old they are.","My mother was a housewife. My father worked in the agriculture business, but they were very encouraging about everything. When I said I wanted to do art, they were very supportive.","I can be very modern and experimental.","I love historical references.","When I was younger, I wanted to be a marine biologist, among other things.","I had a great teacher who was really encouraging and said I should go to Central Saint Martins. So I worked my socks off, and I managed to get a place there. It was there that I developed a real love for design.","The effort you put into anything when you're a designer is 100% because it's all about what you get back out from it.","I've been a fella in the fashion industry for a very long time now, and the industry has been very good to me.","That era of designers being away with the fairies is gone... You've got to live in the real world.","Single-sex private schools, especially in the middle of nowhere on a bleak hill in County Durham - I don't think they make sense.","Animals. They're nice, aren't they? They're good things, animals.","Pretty much hated school. I never really found my footing. I just didn't like lessons.","Fashion was spontaneous and about getting things done, which I really liked.","My designs are slightly subversive in their way; it can be in the cut or the colour, but they're always obtainable: they're not so difficult that a 40-year-old woman wanting to go to a cocktail party looking foxy and a little bit different in something well-made would be alienated by them.","I can never really comment on rumours.","I think when wedding dresses are talked about, every woman has a different set of factors in her mind of what it could be because they've been thinking about it possibly for such a long time.","I like to have a swim in the morning, a great way to start the day.","A healthy body really does make for a healthy mind.","I try to exercise three to four times a week.","The natural world is a source of inspiration.","I was never one for just sitting in front of the telly.","Cecil Beaton was Andy Warhol before Andy Warhol, really.","The reason I wanted to work with New Look was that they wanted to stick with one designer and do lots of collections a year.","Even if you have a lot of money, you may not want to spend a lot of it on clothes.","People are often a bit more adventurous with swimming costume prints; they like the idea of something a bit more jolly.","I go to L.A. three or four times a year. It's great for research.","Fashion designers seem the busiest people on the planet.","I'll spend a couple of days in Paris, a couple back in London, some time at the factory in Italy... I like travelling, but it can be a struggle to get home for weekends.","Just because something is less expensive shouldn't mean it is less well designed.","I don't design for wallflowers.","I always find the idea of Britishness a bit of a boring old concept, to be honest. That world of Britishness always comes off a bit twee and only about cream teas and that sort of things.","My designs at Ungaro are a lot more sexual, in more of an obvious way: my personal designers are a little bit more sideways.","Let's be honest: not everybody can afford to buy £5,000 dresses, so the jewellery is a nice of way of getting the Giles product out into the world and introduce it to people not familiar with the label. QVC is a really good partner to help us do that.","I've always liked historic jewellery that's got a kind of quirkiness or playfulness to it; I like that it's not too serious.","I've always been a big supporter of homeless charities across the board, ever since I first moved to London.","A lot of people's circumstances can change very, very quickly, and people can move jobs, relationships can break down, something else could happen, and the next thing you know, you can't pay your rent, you can't get the support you require, and you're out on the street.","With couture, you're going right to the consumer, and that's something we learned from doing trunk shows. You're meeting the client; you're finding out what they like and what they don't like. You've really got your customer there in front of you, so you know what works and what doesn't.","At a certain period in time, the fashion industry was portraying this image of a totally unrealistic woman, women who are not allowed to be themselves.","There are some great skinny girls, but it's about characters, isn't it? That's what I find attractive. People who've had interesting lives and tell you something that you don't know or are really good fun.","People should just get over themselves.","I liked natural history. I liked the outdoors. And I found the sea quite interesting.","I've always drawn a lot. I like the idea of turning a 2-D sketch into a 3-D thing very quickly. And clothing is really good for that.","I sometimes sit and draw people on the bus, or some fantasy hybrid animal. You know, wherever the hand will lead.","I don't really see the point in planning to show off-schedule. I think it's things like showing on-schedule that helps London be organised as it is.","We design for a whole range of ages and body types, and we always have done. What's great about us is that the common thing that they all like is an accessible eccentricity of an accessible flamboyance, and I think the super thing about that, it isn't age-specific: you're not only dressing 25-year-olds; we're dressing women from 25 to 65+.","There's one thing I would like to do on the high street, and that's something different to what's been done before. So, who knows what that could be.","I'm lucky that I've worked with the biggest divas in the world. We've had Miss Piggy and Minnie Mouse, so I've got to be careful who I say now, but obviously, I'd love to dress them again.","Why shouldn't we want everybody to have a piece of Giles in their wardrobe?","I am really looking forward to walking past people on the street wearing my clothes and know I am designing for an everyday woman.","People don't necessarily realise that there can be just as much work on a quiet jacket as an overblown gown.","People are always saying, 'You use irony,' and it's like, actually, we don't use irony: we use wit and playfulness and irreverence.","One day I'll do a Dorian Gray, and there will be a picture in the attic. I'll look like Helen Daniels from 'Neighbours' after her stroke.","Clothes that a wallflower would like, that's not my thing. I like people who look interesting."],"Giles Duley":["For me, documentary photography has always come with great responsibility. Not just to tell the story honestly and with empathy, but also to make sure the right people hear it. When you photograph somebody who is in pain or discomfort, they trust you to make sure the images will act as their advocate.","People who look at Greek statues never say it's a shame because they're not complete.","My friends love this idea of me as half man, half camera.","For most Olympic athletes, their training is their hardest challenge and where they push themselves to the limit. For Paralympians, training and competition is an escape from the hardships and struggles of their everyday life. That is the difference.","It is funny how it is almost more painful to fall over and scrape your knee than to be blown up. Your body goes into incredible protection mode.","I was obsessed from the moment I took my first photograph. I wanted to make photography my career.","Everyone in a band has a big ego - they love having pictures taken.","A lot of great creativity comes from restrictions.","Alfred Hitchcock had to find ways to create tension without showing it, but now with computer-generated effects you can show anything.","I'm not a war photographer. I've always dealt with the consequences of conflict.","I really love the Olympics: Daley Thompson's back-flip, Derek Redmond's father helping him finish the 400m after his hamstring snapped at the 1992 Games in Barcelona, Carl Lewis, Michael Johnson, Sir Steve Redgrave - childhood memories are flooded with these moments and idols.","For those looking at me, meeting me for the first time, it is the body they see. I am labelled as disabled.","I don't see many people as heroes and, though I love sport, I believe athletes rarely deserve that praise.","When I worked as a music and fashion photographer, I always had the nagging feeling that there was something missing, that I wasn't using my skills productively. I gave up photography - I walked away from it completely - and started doing care work.","If you focus on the things you can't do, you'll destroy yourself. Just remember everything you can do.","To step on a bomb, have your legs blown off and survive, is lucky. Everybody has a good-luck story. Mine was the fact that the senior medic was on patrol that day. Those who don't have a good-luck story are the ones who don't make it."],"Giles Foden":["Detective fiction could not have existed without Edgar Allan Poe.","My father worked in agriculture, and I got to travel round remote rural areas with him and see a bit of the landscape and people.","From 1971 to 1993, my family lived in a number of African countries, including Malawi, Tanzania, Ethiopia and Nigeria, as well as Uganda itself.","My father was an agricultural economist. In 1989 he was posted to Mbarara, a small town on the Uganda-Rwanda border.","It's the swirling river of time that makes our identities, not the monochromatic simplicity of skin colour or the definitive lines of international borders.","To realise belatedly that there are Swahili epic poems which rival their European equivalents for sweep and power has been exciting.","Writing about Africa by Africans has been part of my literary apprenticeship, standing alongside works by authors such as Joseph Conrad, Joyce Cary and Graham Greene as influences.","I grew up in the African bush in Malawi, Tanzania and Uganda, which is my thing. I love the smell of the dust as you bump along in a Land-Rover. I go back there often.","I can't think of a specific meal, but my favourite country for food has got to be France. I love those restaurants in the middle of the village squares.","In Kenya, crime and terrorism are deeply linked, not least by the failure of successive Kenyan governments to control either.","Ordinary Kenyans rightly want to be able to shop safely, and there is a long history of them doing just that, irrespective of their religion or that of the shop owner.","You can gesture at the transnational problem of Islamist terrorism all you like, but it's just hot air unless you invest in proper security on the ground in your own country, with the right safeguards to civil liberties.","The search for inventive ways of telling the tale of Christ's birth has been going on a long time; in a way, difference was there from the start with Luke and Matthew.","In any culture, if information is to maximise in a contextual space, and new meanings be born, the original story has to have substance - there's gotta be gold in them thar hills.","Suffering produces a recursion to the tribe, to one's own kind. When a lot of people suffer, tribes lose their head.","The forgiveness that comes of patient interpretation seems impossible when those nearest to your heart are threatened.","Foreign students add cultural value to their British peers, who need an international outlook.","I spent my childhood tinkering with electronic circuits, on breadboards, as they used to be called, in particular making radio transmitters.","At school, I got into the whole CB thing, hiding a transceiver in my study-bedroom with which I'd make appointments to meet girls in town. I wasn't good enough at physics to take it much further than fun, but I suppose there was a need to communicate.","Since its beginnings, American writing has been in dialogue with other literatures.","Writers such as Richard Powers and the late David Foster Wallace have shown the path to a newer generation of writers for whom all national boundaries are quaint curiosities.","The history of ideas is littered with the corpses of those who have tried to define culture."],"Giles Gilbert Scott":["The artistic taste of the Catholic priests is appalling and I am most anxious to have a Catholic church in which everything is genuine and good, and not tawdry and ostentatious.","I know it is a somewhat delicate matter to refuse a gift, but in this case the statue is so atrocious that every endeavour should be made to keep it out of the church."],"Gilles Duceppe":["I want my own country, not against Canada but for Quebec.","Why is this government so insensitive to the concerns of the middle-class people?","Why would it be ridiculous that Quebec has an army?","I have never believed that things happen by themselves.","Look at what has occurred in history. When the Berlin Wall fell, it was not surprising, but it was unexpected. Who predicted the Arab Spring? Nobody expected it, but all the ingredients were there. I think all the ingredients are also there for Quebec to become a country. But when? That's another question.","My father was an actor, and we have the most important theatre company in Montreal.","It's a falsehood to state that francophone communities are thriving."],"Gilles Marini":["We only live once, and how would you want to be remembered? I have kids. I have, due to my job, a probably higher responsibility to do good things in my life. But also, since I was a kid, I love doing things out of context, helping friends, being different, being a special kind of man is important for me.","I love to dance and perform the Argentine tango - it breathes love!","Bora Bora is peaceful and quiet, but fun, so full of cool activities and more; spiritual to the core, and you leave with fully recharged batteries.","All men are body conscious. If they say they're not, they're lying.","Accents are very sexy. American girls who speak French are very attractive to a Frenchman. Anything exotic or different is attractive.","The difference between a 20-something and a 30-something man? Wisdom. At 20 years old, we don't really get how sensitive and beautiful women are. By 30, we're finally starting to learn.","The Argentine tango is very special to me because it's full of sensuality. The chemistry between the man and woman is absolutely stunning.","Sometimes someone feels like nothing goes their way, and then something really good happens. For me, hearing that I made someone happy makes me feel so alive!"],"Gilles Villeneuve":["If someone said to me that you can have three wishes, my first would have been to get into racing, my second to be in Formula 1, my third to drive for Ferrari.","I will drive flat out all the time. I love racing."],"Gillian Alexy":["'West' is one of those scripts that, when it came out, everyone wanted a piece of it and everyone wanted to be involved in it.","It's fun doing 'McLeod's,' but at the same time the show doesn't go very deep, so there is only so far you can go with a part like that.","There are so many people who want to be the next person on 'Home and Away,' or they just want to be on the cover of a magazine, and they don't really understand the craft. They're not interested in theatre, they're not interested in the art.","You go to New York or L.A., and every waiter wants to be a writer, director or actor. But there's a common thread: everybody wants to do it because they love it."],"Gillian Anderson":["I hope everyone that is reading this is having a really good day. And if you are not, just know that in every new minute that passes you have an opportunity to change that.","Just remember, you can do anything you set your mind to, but it takes action, perseverance, and facing your fears.","Be of service. Whether you make yourself available to a friend or co-worker, or you make time every month to do volunteer work, there is nothing that harvests more of a feeling of empowerment than being of service to someone in need.","My whole belief system is that our paths are drawn for us. I believe in reincarnation. I believe we're here to learn and grow. We choose how we come into this life based on what it is we have to learn. Some people have harder lessons than others.","I truly believe that we can overcome any hurdle that lies before us and create the life we want to live. I have seen it happen time and time again.","I have a tendency to go through my life at full speed and as a one-man band, and so I don't generally stop and take in other people enough to develop many relationships. I'm starting to regret that a bit. I want to change it.","I was a daydreamer, and there is a lot of history and geography and science I missed out on because I was in my head. And I regret that.","When the show's not around any more, it's going to be hard not to have her in my life.","I believe people are in our lives for a reason. We're here to learn from each other.","I think she definitely has. I think, um, her and Mulder's relationship has become more equal. And, I think she has become stronger and more independent over the seasons.","I was a good liar as a child.","It's so funny, because right now I'm very tired and my brains a little dead, I tend to get very focused and serious. So, I'm probably coming off a lot more like Scully right now.","To re-live these characters would be wonderful, because I know when the show ends it will be huge mourning process.","After I did nine years of a television series, I didn't want to do anything really that involved going to a set and being in front of a camera for quite a while. And when I did start to want to do things, I wanted to focus more on film.","I am more spontaneous than my character.","You know, it's a big version of an episode, which I think is necessary at this point because we're drawing in people who not only people who have seen the show before and are devoted to it, but people who have never seen it before.","I think we're tremendously different than the series, if they were to tune in to the series after seeing the movie they might be disappointed. That there was, you know, that they might have some kind of adverse reaction.","I didn't pay as much attention in school as I would have liked to.","The first time, where Fox Mulder and Scully met, she stands up for herself. She stands right there and gives it to him and that was extremely attractive.","At the beginning Scully was much more sceptical than she is now.","In time, she learned to develop her own opinion of the people that she worked for, and she got stronger. Think she's now much stronger. In the beginning she wanted to believe she was strong but sometimes she faltered.","Sometimes I read a script and it's obvious from early on that it's one where the suspension of disbelief has to develop strongly from page one. Some are more reality-based.","I can goof around with other people right up to when we shoot.","I have a real problem with stillness. With just stopping and being quiet.","In my case, I was born to parents who were very young, and I don't think they were entirely ready to have a child. My dad was going to college and working two or three jobs at the same time, and my mum was working and going to school.","I mean the whole thing about meditation and yoga is about connecting to the higher part of yourself, and then seeing that every living thing is connected in some way.","Layers are not difficult for me. You have the luxury of takes, so if you feel like, say, you did not take in the fact that your aunt is across the way in one take, you do it again and try to add that piece."],"Gillian Armstrong":["You rarely, in the professional world, have the chance to express yourself as an individual.","When I was a young filmmaker starting out, I was really snobby about all the affirmative action for women filmmakers because I felt it should be about your talent, and I made a film that won awards, and people wanted me.","Australia has produced amazing costume designers that are unheralded.","Frankly, I get sick of being considered a 'young woman filmmaker' rather than an individual artist, as a man would be.","We need more drama on Australian TV. We've actually dropped the ball on that.","It's really actually been pretty shoddy and appalling, the amount of local content, Australian drama, on ABC TV.","I have worked with some of the most amazing costume designers in the world.","I was a young film student around the time of the new wave in film in the 1970s; old Hollywood was naff and over. For me, as a film student, I was going to see French and Italian cinema; American cinema was 'Easy Rider' and 'Taxi Driver.' Everything was gritty.","Cable television stations in America are now producing such smart, in-depth, non-formula, character-based dramas. Film has turned more and more into big action or cartoons.","I do think the moral line you walk all the time about putting something in for the sake of the film and not being affected by people's lives is a very tough one.","It often takes a couple of years to get a script right and then takes a couple of years to get financing together.","Critics often say, 'Oh she makes films about strong women'. Wrong; I make films about complex characters and the choices they make.","I have major credibility as a hip, out-there documentary filmmaker, and I'm not going to say, 'I'm only a drama filmmaker' anymore.","Australia is much more liberal in accepting de facto relationships than the U.S.","Hollywood is hard on women.","There are really only a handful of directors who have a final cut clause in Hollywood. You only get that power if you've made a couple of hundred-million-dollar successes.","There's nothing like a fresh scone.","'Little Women' has interesting gender connotations. There are generations of women who love the book. But there are a lot of men who think it's sentimental, gooey stuff.","I don't consciously go out looking for themes. They attach themselves to me.","I put on 'Starstruck' for my kids, and they started getting bored. I was so upset, I took it off. They preferred 'Home Alone.'","Boys are lacking in female skills, dropping out of schools and ending up in jails and unemployed because they lack these skills.","I would never do a sexist script.","Sure, you always put some of your own experience into a film.","Maybe women should leave time for themselves and their relationships and just have some fun.","I never worried about topping myself.","The question I always ask is: 'Where are all the women directors in America?' You know, where's the female Martin Scorsese, the female David Lynch?","Maybe not many women are going to film school.","Hollywood is a very old and very structured situation. There's still a lot of old boys at the top who have the money.","When I was 18 years old, I had never before seen Australian film on the big screen.","It only happens once - that an actor is suddenly recognised as the star they are.","After Sept. 11, there was a reticence and worrying about films that touched on war, and even more on terrorism."],"Gillian Cross":["If fiction changes things, it's usually because it's a powerful way of exploring social issues. And it helps us to understand people who are different from us.","I write because I have always been curious about what it would feel like to be someone else, in a different situation. Fiction is a wonderful way of exploring that.","The older I get, the more my curiosity grows, and every book I write is a new exploration.","Fiction is often most powerful when the author is exploring an issue - and not writing like a know-it-all who has the perfect answer.","Non-fiction books have helped me enormously with lots of my books.","Refugees come from many different backgrounds and live in many different circumstances, so I wouldn't like to generalise. But I think refugees from the U.K. would probably be healthier and better fed than those from many other countries.","I'm incurably nosey - so naturally I'm a great reader.","One of the fantastic things about books, fiction or non-fiction, is the way they give you a chance to look into different lives."],"Gillian Flynn":["I am a great believer in jobs for teens. They teach important life lessons, build character, and inflict just the right amount of humiliation necessary for future success in the working world.","I was not always someone who wanted to get married or thought I would get married, so being a true writer, I was always navel-gazing: 'What are good marriages? What are bad marriages?'","You have to be pretty selfless to have a child, who doesn't give a lot back to you.","I have four or five ideas that just keep floating around and I want to kind of just let one - like a beautiful butterfly, let it land somewhere.","I always loved ghost stories and haunted house stories, whether they were done in a fantasy way or done in a realistic way.","I watched 'Psycho' a million times.","For me, suspense is always harder and better than going for the quick, outright scare.","My first two novels featured narrators who were aggressively unattached: They couldn't form any sort of genuine relationship. So I had thoroughly explored the geography of loneliness and isolation.","Some of the most disturbing, sick relationships I've witnessed are between long-time friends, and especially mothers and daughters.","I've always had a fondness for the Gothic. That's what kind of stories attract me: Why do people do bad things?","I was not a nice little girl. My favorite summertime hobby was stunning ants and feeding them to spiders.","Women shouldn't be expected to only play nurturing, kind caretakers.","I think it's a very female trait to want to please men and to want to be considered the Cool Girl. And if you take that to the farthest reach, where you're actually selling yourself out and degrading yourself by doing things you don't actually want to do, only in order for this man to think that you do, that's a very perverse thing.","Even good characters have their dark sides, and I think it is important that women aren't seen as innately good.","I think that women really entwine with the people that they become close to in a way that men don't - and so, when they are forced to disentwine, you can't remove the vines without doing some damage.","I think women do have that fatal streak to them that's partly because it's been romanticized, the martyr complex - 'Look what you did to me!'","Being a novelist, you can roam around with a story and indulge yourself.","I'm not hyper-opinionated, but when I do have an opinion, I'm very stubborn, and I want to persuade everyone to my point of view.","Books and movies are kind of my two great loves. I don't have too many other actual hobbies. That's pretty much it.","I grew up in the '80s where there's a lot of these kind of post-apocalyptic, post-comet, post-whatever it was, so that always captured my imagination a lot as a little kid, that idea of getting access to secret places and being able to roam around where you're not supposed to.","I'm all for whatever transitions the book properly to a movie.","I'm a true-crime addict. It's not something I'm particularly proud of, but I can't stop.","There are no really new stories anymore.","I can't think of anything more crushing than slowly, over time, realizing exactly how wrong you were about someone.","I think mystery writers and thriller writers - whatever genre you want to call it - are taking on some of the biggest, most interesting kind of socioeconomic issues around in a really interesting, compelling way.","We're into this barrage of pop culture - you know, TV, movies, the Internet. We become creatures that we've made up, made of certain different flotsam from pop culture and certain different personas that are in style.","To me, marriage is the ultimate mystery.","I feel like I need to give people a note with the book that says, 'I'm OK, no worries!'","I always loved scary movies, and my dad was a film professor.","I do spend - I feel like I spend about my first 20 minutes at any cocktail party convincing people that I'm not going to harm them in some way.","There's nothing lovelier than having a newborn and still plotting a dark conspiracy.","I was very interested in what happens to the husband when his wife goes missing, and how quickly they can be turned into heroes and villains.","As a kid in the eighties, I didn't need much disposable income. I went to Catholic school - white shirt, plaid skirt - so fashion choices were limited. But youth finds a way. For me and my schoolmates, neon argyle socks were a crucial barometer of coolness. Hair ribbons, too, and they didn't come cheap.","My first job had me miscast as a bubbly shopgirl; I was pathologically shy and, thus, tended to replace human speech with excessive head gestures. It was like being waited on by Harpo Marx.","Female violence is a specific brand of ferocity. It's invasive. A girlfight is all teeth and hair, spit and nails - a much more fearsome thing to watch than two dudes clobbering each other.","Libraries are filled with stories on generations of brutal men, trapped in a cycle of aggression. I wanted to write about the violence of women.","The funny thing, I guess, is that my husband ended up being the muse of a book about the worst marriage in the world, because if he hadn't consistently said, 'Don't censor yourself, don't worry about me' - if he'd been anxious and worried about it - then it would never have gotten written.","It seems like the darker the books are, the nicer the person is. People say it's the romance writers you've got to watch out for.","People focus on the darker female characters in my books, but for every one of those, I can also show you an equally screwed up man that no one ever comments about, or a nicer woman that no one comments about. I don't feel like that's my specialty.","No one watches 'Taxi Driver' and says, 'Oh, it's a male-oriented film.' No one looks at nine-tenths of the films out there that are headlined by men and say, 'It's a male-oriented film.'","There's nothing that can drive me from zero to crazy faster than a man who comes up to me and says, 'You know, I don't normally read books by women, but I really liked 'Gone Girl.''","The newspaper industry was built on the penny dreadfuls.","Women are just as violently minded as men are, but with men, it's taken for granted.","I tend to write about dark things that happen in a very domestic setting 'cause that, to me, is much scarier than the unknown.","The first time my mom read my very first book, she was like, 'I'm not gonna belabor this. It's not a big deal. But I have to ask the question: Is everything okay?'","My dad was a film professor, so he would take me to wildly inappropriate movies.","Kansas City is truly an awesome town.","In college, I discovered the Joyce Carol Oates short story 'Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?' which is definitely one of the most incredibly unnerving, frightening short stories ever written.","I was a quirky kid. I think that's the kind way of putting it.","My favorite game was one I invented with my cousins called Mean Aunt Rosie, where I was a deranged maiden aunt who chased them around the house.","I read all kinds of novels, as long as they're good.","I like westerns, fantasy, sci-fi, graphic novels, thrillers, and I try to avoid the word 'genre' altogether. A good book is a good book.","A really great popcorn movie is extremely hard to pull off. A really great popcorn book is equally hard to pull off, so I don't feel guilty devouring one.","A great thriller, to me, is more about creating a sense of unease: a queasiness that comes with knowing something is not quite right.","That's always been part of my goal - to show the dark side of women. Men write about bad men all the time, and they're called antiheroes.","What I read and what I go to the movies for is not to find a best friend, not to find inspirations, not necessarily for a hero's journey. It's to be involved with characters that are maybe incredibly different from me, that may be incredibly bad but that feel authentic.","A theme that has always interested me is how women express anger, how women express violence. That is very much part of who women are, and it's so unaddressed. A vast amount of literature deals with cycles of violence about men, antiheroes. Women lack that vocabulary.","As much as I really like the screenwriting thing, the novel is where the author has so much control.","You don't normally see incredibly ugly people who've gone missing and it becomes a sensation.","I'm not much of a procedural person. That's not what I'm interested in.","One of my rules about writing exercises is you never are allowed to put them in your book because it's just too tempting. You try to shoehorn things that don't belong.","I love video games.","I liked the idea of a whodunit revolving around a marriage.","Very quickly, I discovered I did not have what it takes to be a good crime reporter: I was too unassertive and a little bit wimpy. It was very clear that was not what I was going to do, but I loved journalism, and I'm the daughter of a film professor, and my mom taught reading.","I grew up in a house full of books.","My interest is in turning over a rock and seeing what's underneath. It's a personality trait more than anything; it's what made me want to become a crime reporter, even though I was not suited for it personality-wise.","I find, the older I get, the more surprised I am about how hesitant people are to say what they really want, what they really dream about, what really drives them. It's as if sometimes we're sort of embarrassed, as we get older, to be transparent about that. But you save so much time if you're transparent about what you want.","I just think - the Midwest, if you grow up there, you're deathly afraid of putting on airs. Any time a Midwesterner criticizes someone, it's usually involving some form of being too big for your britches.","I love a good worst-case scenario. My brain just kind of works that way. I like that idea of how much a person can get away with, and why.","I don't think I'm naturally a good person. I think some people have an innate goodness to them, and I am sort of proud of the fact that I kind of keep myself in check, probably because I have awesome parents.","I'm probably a guy's girl, although I hate that phrase. I tend to have more close male friends than I do female friends, and I always have. I would say that of my 10 close friends, seven are men.","I am not someone who has hobbies. I have tried knitting, and I can't figure it out.","The number of mystery and horror writers I've met who are just the sanest and the nicest people... it's crazy. Maybe it's because the writing gets something out of the system?","The best crime reporters don't mind charging in - but they also know how to do it as decent human beings.","One of my biggest peeves is when the writer hasn't given you enough information to figure everything out. You should be able to go back to the beginning of 'Gone Girl,' after you've already read it and you know everything, and say, 'Check - check - yes, she gave us that information.'","I've never been interested in watching or reading anything because it's the hero's story. I don't feel the need to be inspired by the character or learn a lesson. I feel the need to be engaged by them.","I've wondered if 'Harry Potter' would have been as big if it was 'Harriet Potter.' Now that I've written a screenplay - and raising a son in particular - I'm looking at story content and realizing how limited women are onscreen.","I think women are very ambidextrous. We don't think twice about reading a book or a movie starring guys. But for guys, it's, like, 'Oh my God, that's a woman thing.' So with my son, I very carefully portion out the female heroes and characters to make sure he's getting an equal amount.","I love Robin Wright's character in 'House of Cards' because she's a bona fide villain. She's a not-nice person in a believable way; you can see her working in the world.","What I tell myself is that there is never going to be another 'Gone Girl' for me. I mean, I really believe that. I think I'll write other good books; I have faith in that.","There are so many good books, I don't want to only read within one particular type.","I love Joyce Carol Oates. I love Margaret Atwood, T.C. Boyle. Arthur Phillips is always consistent.","I've always been a mystery fan. My very first grown-up book, I distinctly remember going to the library and my mom helping me pick out an Agatha Christie book. I was in fifth grade or something and very proud of being in the adult fiction aisles. I tore through 'The Mysterious Affair at Styles.'","I assumed that 'Gone Girl' would do incrementally better than 'Dark Places,' and that would be great. So the fact that it did more than that was kind of an incredibly pleasant surprise.","I have two kids, and anyone who has a kid in order to feel loved is going to be in trouble because kids are first and foremost all about themselves. They'll say they love you, but 10 seconds later they'll turn on you.","There's a book by Anne Rivers Siddons called 'The House Next Door' that I just think is one of the all-time great haunted-house stories. I think that's one of the all-time greatest.","I do love 'The Turn of the Screw' - I just think that one's always so disturbing.","I think everyone self-mythologizes.","'Rosemary's Baby' is one of my all-time favorite books. I love that it just ends with, you know, 'Hey, the devil's in the world, and guess what? Mom kind of likes him!' And that's the end.","I've always read in order to figure out people more, and that includes bad people and good people.","I want books to give me insight into the way people's brains work and hearts work, and that's what engages me.","I could not have written a novel if I hadn't been a journalist first, because it taught me that there's no muse that's going to come down and bestow upon you the mood to write. You just have to do it. I'm definitely not precious.","The midwest is great because it hasn't been entirely claimed. There's more room to write about it; it's harder to write about New York, because even if you've never been there, you think you know what it's like. To do it in any sort of fresh way is trickier.","I get really tense during the first draft. Really tense. That's not great for my family, because the first draft usually takes about a year.","I've seen movies that are slavishly devoted to books but don't work because they haven't turned it into a movie: they've turned it into a dramatisation of the different scenes.","I like the idea that people who see 'Gone Girl' are possibly going to come out with incredibly different reactions to it - not just between men and women, but if you are in a good relationship or a bad relationship. Everyone is going to bring their own bundle of prejudices and viewpoints and experiences to it.","I love the way the Victorians found a way to put faces in everything: you know, furniture and marble and, you know, everywhere you turn around - the banister, you know, there's someone looking at you.","Ever since I was a child, I've been a huge comic and graphic novel fan, but I've never tried writing one before.","I would love to do a full-scale graphic novel.","I was very lucky to grow up in a household that really valued storytelling and didn't find it frivolous.","I mostly go under the radar, which is fantastic because I would not be a good famous person.","The skill set that lets you be alone in your pyjamas for two years writing a book is not the same skill set that lets you go on television shows like 'The View' or 'Late Night With Jimmy Fallon.'","Because I'm a woman writing about women who do bad things, that's somehow very 'other.' When men write that, it's called a novel. It's just a book.","It's important to tell stories, and it's a worthwhile thing to do.","Writing has certainly helped me explore about 20,000 versions of my authentic self. I suppose that's what most writers discover if they write long enough: there are a lot of selves roaming around in there.","In marriage, it's best to keep perspective. Get out of your head and get some perspective.","I was always someone who wanted to write. I was a real shy, bookworm-ish kid, and I think my earliest stuff was fairly dark.","I had been laid off from 'Entertainment Weekly 'right before I started writing 'Gone Girl.'","I spent a lot of - too much of - my childhood watching movies and thinking about movies.","I love 'Fatal Attraction.'"],"Gillian Gilbert":["You can never tell with New Order. Just when you think the band is coming to an end, it takes off again.","In 1983, before computers came along, it wasn't easy to do electronic basslines and rhythms.","Blue Monday's distinctive intro was written on an Oberheim DMX drum machine.","'Blue Monday' is a dance track with a hint of melancholy.","When I joined New Order, I was made to feel equal to everyone else in the band so I didn't feel like an outsider. I was treated equally, I was paid equally, and my opinion was sought after.","I didn't want children until my late thirties because my career was taking off, and I was having such a good time in New Order. But when you have children, you have to make decisions; I always wanted to stay at home with my kids.","There's a tendency when you write a book to portray yourself as the hero."],"Gillian Jacobs":["You can convey a lot of emotion with just some eyebrows and mouth movement.","'Fresh Air' I listen to, like, every day.","Nobody knows what the future is except for wizards.","I think there's a sort of satisfaction in defying people's expectations.","I had my life Monday through Friday in school, and then I had my 'real life,' which was my acting class on Saturday.","A lot of my friends are guys, so I'm used to bro antics.","I am trying to break free from my stripes addiction, but the pull is strong! I need help buying non-stripes.","When I was younger, I was very vocal to the point of being strident in my views.","I think maybe my mom thought that Katharine Hepburn would be a good role model of, like, a strong, smart, independent woman. Maybe she steered me in that direction. You know, because she was really so ahead of her time.","I've been getting into drinking smoothies in the morning - I like those a lot.","When you can impress your mom by saying you've been to someone's concert, you know you're pretty lame.","We all wish there were more 'Bridesmaids' out there.","I like the 'Moth' podcast a lot. I listen to that.","I am wrestling with the overalls trend. I wore so many pairs in junior high, and no one thought they were cute. Perhaps I'll try them cuffed with a tasteful crop top?","I am short, so even if there are things that I like, or like on other people, I have to be aware that sometimes that won't work on me because I'm not 5'10. It has to have a shape for my body; otherwise, I look like I am two inches tall. I have to wear things that skim my body more closely than a runway model would.","What I think is a really special movie is 'Black and White' with Kevin Costner and Octavia Spencer, which Mike Binder directed. I got to see a screening of it, and I think Kevin and Octavia and Anthony Mackie and Bill Burr all give such beautiful performances in that movie.","I don't like yelling insults at someone who's never done anything to me.","Boy, you know, it's amazing how your brain can turn into a sieve, and you can literally forget episodes that you have shot.","I keep reminding myself, through all the ups and downs of 'Community,' that I might never have another job that really means something to people the way 'Community' means something to people. That's more powerful than ratings.","Some girls say they don't feel comfortable in flats, they only feel comfortable in heels; I am not one of those girls.","Things are never simple when it comes to the human heart.","I'm a very law-abiding citizen, and I've never consciously broken any law. I get nervous just jaywalking in Los Angeles!","I'd never really done comedy before 'Community,' so getting to work day in and day out with all these great people, directors, writers, and actors, I feel like I've learned a lot.","I had some years of definite frustration. Auditioning and not working as much as I would have liked to, or working and being paid a pittance, and sort of scrounging by in New York and sleeping on a chair that folded out into a bed.","I'm not conservative, but I am kind of clean living in my own life.","Actors get bored.","I never thought I would be in a comedic role; my past is in drama.","Actors are all narcissists.","College is expensive; I always knew that, and I wanted to make money, partially to spend a little of it here and there, but primarily for a college savings fund.","NBC gives comedies a chance to find their legs.","I used to babysit. And the kids I babysat were huge Hilary Duff fans, and so we used to have dance parties every day to her music. So I am very familiar with the albums of Miss Hilary Duff.","As you become an adult and start to make your way in life, you realize how much your friends are your family - though you get to make fun of your friends, too.","I like passionate fandom.","A lot of people watch 'Community,' but DVR viewings only count if you watch within a certain time.","We're all slight hypocrites who fall short of our ideals.","I think when you have some success as a kid, your notion of being a good actor is pleasing the director, doing exactly what they tell you to do.","I always had an easier time with adults. Somehow, I was always old! I still feel old.","In sixth grade, we all had to write this opinion paper. Most wrote about things like why we should be able to chew gum in class - I wrote about why women should receive equal pay.","I've always thought - and I don't even know if I'd be right for the part - that Jean Seberg would make a great biopic. She was in Jean-Luc Godard's 'Breathless,' she played Joan of Arc. She had this eventful and traumatic adulthood, she thought the FBI was after her, and she became a darling of the French New Wave.","I never pursued anything but acting. But as a kid, I was really interested in the Supreme Court. I wanted to to be a Supreme Court justice, but didn't want to be a lawyer. I just wanted to go straight to being a justice.","In my sort of young, idealistic mind, I was just like, 'Well, it's either theater or film for me, and that will be that!'","I went to college and got my degree in acting, but because it was all theater, I really consider my first couple years on 'Mad Men' as amazing training for working in television and for acting on-camera.","No actor wants to choose - they just want all of the options available to them all the time; we tend to be pretty greedy.","While I love film and want to continue to pursue it 100 percent, my home is TV.","My mom wouldn't let me buy clothes she didn't like, so I dressed like a middle-aged woman in high school.","Craig Robinson is basically the mayor of wherever he goes.","I love discovering new young brands and watching these fashion lines take off, like Peter Pilotto, Christopher Kane, and Clover Canyon.","I know other actors who are relieved when their shows get cancelled, and I've never felt that way about 'Community.'","Thinking back about throwing myself at certain gentlemen that had no interest in me, that'll bring a blush to my face if I think about it too often.","No one in my school liked me.","Apparently, I have good feet for ballet.","I used to like to make myself sad, so I would listen to Bill Callahan as Smog.","'Dancing on My Own' is actually a really sad song! It has totally made me cry.","I feel like so often I'm just, like, running around and eating in the car, which is, like, not good, or eating as I'm walking down the street.","I really like the concept of, like, slowing down and savoring your food, enjoying it.","I've gotten super into restaurants in L.A., so I try to go to different restaurants all the time... that's a good way to explore L.A.: you can drive to a restaurant and discover a new neighborhood.","I did live in New York. Yeah, I moved to L.A. for 'Community.' And I gave up my apartment in New York.","Dan Harmon has this idea that characters on TV are allowed to talk about their favorite movies and TV shows and songs.","My grandfather can barely even hear, and Chevy Chase makes a face, and he laughs.","My mom wouldn't know Tom Cruise if he punched her in the face.","I am very up front about about my inability to pronounce things correctly.","I love Opening Ceremony, Kenzo - anything Humberto Leon and Carol Lim touch. I drool over Christopher Kane, Mary Katrantzou, Delpozo, and Wes Gordon.","I can't tell you the number of people that are like, 'Has anyone ever told you you look like a blonde Liv Tyler?' And at this point, I'm like, 'Yes... yes, I've been told that.' I mean, she's beautiful. It's not like I'm not totally flattered by it, but then again, I think I look like myself.","A movie that I've seen probably the most is 'Fanny & Alexander,' the Ingmar Bergman movie. I even dragged my friends to the super long version that had an intermission. I don't know how much they liked me that day.","I have a hard time watching people getting punched on screen; I have to close my eyes a lot.","You can only do so many serious dramas in a row before you want to break. You want a change.","I very rarely listen to music in my car - a lot of people make fun of me for it. But sometimes I listen to music on YouTube. I'm like a teenager.","In Los Angeles, sometimes it's hard to find a magazine stand, let alone one that has the magazine that you want. So I find that the longer I live in L.A., the more digitally I consume.","I'm spending way too much time test running my Vine videos. I'll go into a room and close the door and be in there for an hour workshopping a Vine video that I never even post. So that's probably a huge time suck.","It's funny shooting movies because you get to see clubs during daylight hours, which no one should ever see - it's not pretty; there's a reason the lighting is dim in there.","When you're shooting at 9 A.M. at a club, you have to use all of your acting skills.","I want there to be tons and tons and tons and tons of movies starring women.","I'm really excited that 'The Other Woman' did so well at the box office, and I hope that will keep encouraging people to make movies about women, starring women, about female friendships. More. Please.","I've had weird, weird acting jobs. Low-budget filmmaking where you find yourself in really bizarre places.","I feel like the Internet has embraced the pizza dance. I feel appreciated for once in my life.","I think when you're in a relationship, either you have something or your partner generally has something that you're having to deal with.","Sometimes movies that I'm in that I have a leading role don't necessarily get the biggest release, so it's a difficult thing between balancing indies that have uncertain futures and maybe larger films that have guaranteed releases that you have a smaller part in.","For me, I really love 'Tim and Eric' and 'Dr. Steve Brule' and a lot of the Adult Swim shows, so I like strange, weird, sometimes slightly upsetting humor.","I'm a Bravoholic, and I love 'RuPaul's Drag Race.'","On the set of 'Community,' we quote 'Community' to each other. We're a lost cause. We're like a bunch of little kids running around and yelling things.","I don't think I've ever been mistaken for anyone.","I think you just have to take everything that happens on a TV show with a grain of salt. You sign up for a show for six years having zero idea where they're going to go with the character, so you just have to get on the ride of the show and go with wherever they take you.","I troll Instagram, Style.com, Elle.com.","I used to live in New York, and I have friends that work in the fashion world, and I feel like I had an ear to the ground there.","You have to have an awareness of where you're going, what the event is, what you're promoting, and who the audience is. That always informs the way you dress.","As you can tell by my IMDB page, I like to work.","I'm a terrible cook.","I've always wanted to work with Elizabeth Banks. She's so talented and funny, and she's become this force of nature - directing, producing. Being around her is kind of inspiring.","I feel like I go through cycles as an actress.","My mom always said fighting with me as a kid was like going to court. I'm trying to realize that being right is not the most important thing.","You're always looking to have a unique experience as an actor, and definitely, being punched by a puppet ranks as a singular experience in my career.","Hey, I'm nothing but honest!","There were definitely bands and musicians I liked that drove my mother insane. I probably liked them all the more for it! Bjork drove my mom nuts. What I listened to was actually pretty mom-friendly for the most part. I wasn't very rebellious.","'The New Yorker's fiction podcast I like a lot, where they have authors pick short stories by other authors that appeared in 'The New Yorker.'","The more attention you give to your negative feelings, the more they grow, so I think things just start to blow totally out of proportion.","I'd say I've gone to grad school for comedy being on 'Community.'","I've had a very positive experience in L.A. in the comedy world and found everyone to be very nice and welcoming. It's been really fun.","Even something as stupid as Vine videos makes you feel like you're making things on your own.","I think that there are a lot of really beautiful Christmas carols, and then sometimes there are horrible renditions of them that are played to death in malls that make me sad. I try to avoid stores where they're playing bad versions of Christmas songs on repeat.","A lot of people I went to college with felt like they wanted to pursue theater exclusively, so I don't think that I really was in competition with people that I went to school with.","I think we've probably all read a word that we've never heard pronounced out loud, and we try it out in a sentence and fall on our face.","I think I signed some contract, early on in my career, that I will only kiss Steve Carell when I do a movie.","I am not a big 'Hunger Games' fan.","I would love it if 'Community' could have a trajectory like '30 Rock' and choose when to go out.","I'm a pretty goofy person. I'm an awkward dancer, for instance, and a terrible singer.","They didn't really encourage my goofy, comedic side at Juilliard.","I have a lot of good stories for talk shows about the conditions in which I worked.","I think, you know, when you're an actor who's had periods of unemployment, it makes you feel really good to have a job - to say that you're expected somewhere, do you know what I mean?","I'm a worry-wart, I'd say.","A friend of mine wrote a script, a feminist romantic comedy. She had a feminist scholar consult on it. My friend said, 'Oh, my friend Gillian read it and really loved it.' She goes, 'Gillian Jacobs, you mean: Britta Perry, feminist icon?'","I've definitely run from the cops in the New York City subways.","I always want to do something I haven't done before and get to work with other actors, writers, or directors that I want to work with.","There is a great degree of comfort with your family when you're on a TV show.","You know it's a good show when you involve fire and dolls and unitards.","'The Comeback' is my favorite TV show of all-time because it's just brill. It's Lisa Kudrow's show about what it's like to be an actor on a TV show. She's so amazing on it.","I haven't ever seen 'Lost'... I'm sorry.","Inspiration strikes at very funny times.","Like, I'm hyper-conscious about going to bed on time, and doing my seven-step skin care routine at night.","My poor, problematic feet don't let me wear anything much over a three- or four-inch heel.","I say the word N-U-C-L-E-R the same way that George W. Bush says it.","As opposed to trying to make a kiss look romantic or sweet or passionate, it's kind of fun to just have the freedom to make it look weird, goofy and awkward.","My inners are not organs. They're actually mechanics, so I have a hole in my back, wind me up like the movie 'Hugo,' and then just say, 'Act,' you know?","There are these important things in some people's lives that can make you laugh even when you're going through a tough time or a stressful week.","I'm not really a rapper!","It's really nice when life comes full circle and you get to work with people four years down the line.","I had kissed a girl in the second season of 'Community,' but that was my first time kissing a girl ever, and I was so nervous, I almost knocked Brit Marling's teeth out.","I've thought a lot about how if something horrible happened, and if it were like 'The Road' situation, I've decided I don't want to survive past the death of society as we know it.","We're all alone in this world.","I think if I was in over 250 films, the world would get pretty sick of me. I would probably never get put in anything ever again.","I think 'Glee' was a freshman comedy, and I think whenever it's your debut season, you get compared a lot to the other shows, regardless if there's any sort of overlap in content or tone or anything, just because you came out in the same year.","I wasn't necessarily looking to do comedy on TV, but I don't think it's an accident that I ended up on 'Community.'","You've got to get as literal as you can get to convince people sometimes that you can do something.","Acting by yourself is pretty darn hard, especially having to do physical comedy.","I haven't done improv since I was in middle school.","Ken Jeong might be my biggest fan.","It really does mean so much when your cast mates, who you respect so much, tell you that you made them laugh."],"Gillian Tans":["Instead of traveling on a weekend, begin your trip on a Tuesday or Wednesday, which are often the cheapest days to fly. Being flexible with timing can help with savings.","Starting a business and building a product are not for the faint of heart. You have to learn to not let little disappointments get you down and to stay focused on the big picture.","The mission of Booking is to empower people to experience the world. Whatever people want to do, wherever they want to go, they can book it with us.","Our mission is to empower people to experience the world.","Eventually, we want to be able to say, whether in your own neighborhood or a city across the globe, our technology will be needed to break through barriers - whether it's money, time, languages, or simply choice.","We believe in global scalability with local relevance.","We have many accommodation owners - people who own small hotels, villas and bungalows - and the digital economy has opened up a world of possibility for these business owners. Now, they can sell to and communicate with people around the world, and where Booking.com comes in is to help these accommodation owners adapt to the digital world.","We have built out the diversity of our product teams, and we saw the caliber of our testing and experimentation improve significantly.","We found we were able to create better, customer-centric product features more quickly with a more diverse product team.","An American customer can book in English all over the world, but also, somebody from Japan or China can book in their own language everywhere. We translate all of our content into these languages, and that's quite unique. We service our direct customers - the innkeepers - as well in their own language.","As a company, we believe in free and open borders. We feel this best facilitates the exchange of cultural values and ideas.","People always travel no matter what.","India has a sizeable chunk of the Asian travel market - both inbound and outbound travel.","We are a bottom-up culture, and we need a communications platform that can facilitate that.","The move to Internet-enable travel booking is creating massive convenience, efficiency, and savings for consumers.","There are more and more properties joining us to benefit from and leverage our global online marketing expertise.","Both business and leisure travellers are enjoying unprecedented levels of choice.","On the one hand, you have markets such as Singapore and Thailand, with an extremely strong inbound booker market and a well-developed tourism industry. You also have markets that are just opening up to tourists, like Myanmar, that have massive growth potential and then markets that are extremely fragmented within themselves such as Indonesia.","India is a fast-growth market and is developing a lot. We continue to increase our partners here and make investments.","From our earliest days, Booking.com has been deploying technology to help strip the friction out of travel.","Friction still exists in travel, and we are on a quest to go even further to make the entire experience - from planning to staying and beyond - even easier with technology.","Things like chatbots, machine learning tools, natural language processing, or sentiment analysis are applications of artificial intelligence that may one day profoundly change how we think about and transact in travel and local experiences.","Employing women is good for business.","There's no point being at the airport longer than needed.","Japan is a very important market for us and has grown remarkably as one of the most popular travel destinations in the world.","Eventually, people should just say 'give me the best hotel in a certain date in a certain location.'","With any previous transition we made with technology, it hasn't been the case that we need less people.","If you look around Booking.com, it's a very gender-balanced company.","One in five of our customers books for business. But it's scaling very fast. As a result, we have tools for medium or small-sized companies to allow them set their price and give basic reporting functionality.","I think companies need to take more ownership over the gender gap themselves because if everybody does that, then overall, it will improve.","We know that companies which have more women in leadership positions have a better performance.","As CEOs or board members, women are still underrepresented, and that gap is actually growing.","Booking.com is one of the biggest translation companies in the world.","Travel is a combination of the personal and the emotional.","Booking travel is not like shopping or groceries or booking a restaurant. It's much less frequent, so understanding what works just takes a lot more time.","Every customer is different, and the travel experience is completely fluid, but the end goal is to find the best solutions.","I am a woman, and I am proud to say that I work in technology. But I also recognise that the combination of those two facts puts me in the minority.","Tech is a key driver of social and economic change, and around the world, women like me are transforming businesses, industries, and communities.","Not only do we need more women in the technology sector, we also clearly need to refocus energy on improving gender equality in the global economy.","There is a misperception among job seekers that opportunities for women in tech exist only for those with coding or engineering experience. To be sure, technology firms do need women with these skills, but they also need women with expertise in other areas, like marketing and finance.","As a company powered by technology and digital innovation, Booking.com believes strongly in ensuring equal access and opportunity for all within the technology sector.","Recognizing that female participation in technology is lower than it should be, we are committed to bolstering female tech talent, eliminating obstacles and challenges they face, and fostering diversity.","Education is crucial in determining which profession women will choose, so it's important to spark interest in technologies at an early age.","I've always been curious and taken many risks, but that is quite atypical for a woman. On the other hand, I think that's the only way to grow beyond yourself.","If firms were made to hire according to quotas, it might optimize the percentage of women in the industry, but that doesn't necessarily translate into more quality products for the customer.","We will invest more into China to make sure that our brand gets more known to Chinese customers.","China's domestic travel is increasing, and that's why we are building our teams here in China.","We want to make sure that we have the right products for Chinese people.","I'm a master at getting as much in a day as possible.","Typically, I get to the office around eight o'clock. I have a very mixed schedule, and I always try to keep time for things that are not planned. You need time for whatever might pop up in the week.","If you run a global business, it's so important that you understand what happens in each place, and you can't do that remotely. I don't want to go anywhere and leave and not have seen the people who work for us. That doesn't feel good.","I travel very light. I never want to check a bag. My only standards are a few sets of clothes, my white sneakers, my blue backpack, and my laptop. I don't have any special things otherwise.","Traveling changes you as a person. If you buy something, it's so different than if you put your money into traveling.","Traveling is an experience that you can always carry with you. It makes the world come together more so we understand each other better.","And as a woman, you need to take risks. Don't stay too long in your own swim lane.","The culture of Booking.com has been very good for me because it's a culture where you're allowed to fail. When you think about taking risks, if it's OK to fail, you actually do a lot more. And you learn a lot quicker.","From the early days, Booking.com has been disruptive. Our aim is to create the best product for our customers, and we do that through constant innovation and testing.","If you're afraid of failure or getting it wrong, you'll never truly innovate or disrupt the market.","Many people think we are a technology company, but we are totally customer-led.","My mother was from an entrepreneurial family and very creative. She always pushed me to take risks, to do things I wouldn't have thought of.","What always drove me was my curiosity. That's what made me join Booking and not be afraid to leave a very successful job and then go into a startup.","I found the Internet really fascinating.","There are a few books I can recommend, but one you should read for sure is 'Do More Faster,' a book full of advice for young entrepreneurs. Looking back at the early days of Booking.com, I recognize a lot of things that feature in this the book - like 'fail fast, learn quickly.'","Booking.com started with just a website, but we've always thought of our company as being more than just a website.","Using science to tell us what customers are looking for is second nature for us here.","A long time ago, we had to build interfaces to connect with other companies, and I thought that was a great idea. The company had to pay a lot of money to build it and basically launched it, but our whole operating system almost broke. So, we couldn't continue it. In the end, I had to go on the train to Paris to explain that I had spent millions.","When you start very young and you start to work, you're going to fail. That's how you learn.","I don't think there's ever a wrong answer as long as people are willing to learn, share. You're never done learning.","Technology's great, but you can only be as good in technology as your people are.","For me, it's about taking things that do not take a lot of space. Don't take a lot of shoes. I tend to pack a lot of dresses, for instance, because they take up less space.","We wanted to go much bigger than anybody else. That's why we've targeted so many countries.","In the beginning of Booking.com, we were travelling around Europe a lot. Sometimes we'd do five cities in a week.","Booking.com has been very good at performance marketing. That's how we grew our business.","There are a lot of threats out there. Amazon can enter the travel market. Google could enter the accommodation space. But that is not something that we actively focus on.","We are putting a lot of investments behind building customer loyalty. We need to make sure we keep investing in the right tech that will help customers. If we keep doing that well, we will keep progressing.","Whether you are checking luggage or bringing a carry-on, always weigh and measure your bags to make sure they are below the airline's size and weight restrictions. Excess baggage fees can be costly. Avoid all baggage fees by only bringing a carry-on.","Pack snacks. Food prices once you pass through airport security or within blocks of a major tourist attraction can be double the price. Pack travel-friendly snacks or visit a grocery store in the destination you are visiting to get a better price.","Understand tipping culture. Whereas Americans tip 15-20% when dining out, most European countries don't tip, as a service charge is typically included in the bill. Make sure you're not over-tipping by doing research before traveling."],"Gillian Turner":["Why should we take options off the table in advance?","Don't simply insist that the American future will be bright if we vote for you and damned if you don't; explain how and why. We deserve the truth, and we can handle it.","Ivanka Trump's star is ascendant at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and around the world, too.","For even the most seasoned diplomats and foreign policymakers, the Israel-Palestinian conflict is a pressure cooker assignment that can cause angst of an existential nature.","In the Arab and Israeli worlds' eyes, Jared Kushner is a perfectly plausible American arbiter of - if not peace - then at least more process, procedure, and posturing.","The United States and its European allies need to start viewing foreign assistance to some messy and unsavory regions of the world as investments in our collective future rather than charity; we're paying money now so that we don't have to pay with blood and treasure later.","We need to offer Africans the alternatives to terrorist recruitment that their own governments cannot. This includes, yes, jobs.","Eradicating terrorist organizations and neutering radical Islam means very little if we cannot first guarantee we'll all be here tomorrow.","In an era of rapidly evolving security threats that are often asymmetrical and unpredictable in nature, nuclear weapons are an existential threat we can count on."],"Gillian Welch":["I do think that the abiding mystery of my origins has definitely had a profound effect upon my writing. There is that thing in the back of my mind where I think I don't really know who I am. And it may make it a little easier to shift around in my narrative voice.","The main thing was finding this... voice that I had interest in, which I'll call the quiet-yet-stoic voice: the very quiet yet very strong voice that I developed, that people would want to hear and that was worth paying attention to.","I've never been the kind of person who would get up and wave my arms and scream and shout and say, 'Hey, listen to this, listen to this.'","I love that there's this tradition of being able to discuss the heaviest topics and the gnarliest stuff that goes down in people's lives in traditional Southern American music.","I like the songs to appear very simple and to flow by without any kind of hiccup, but there has to be this impression of other currents underneath. Like if the songs aren't, on some level, multidimensional, we lose interest in them."],"Gillian Zinser":["I love the way little kids dress themselves! They're completely carefree about how others perceive them.","I'm definitely much more of a beach bunny. I prefer the sun over the snow.","The people in my life are friends I have by choice. I've made a conscious effort to have them in life. I only have the time and energy for so many people, which has cut down my friend group to a handful, but I'm so much happier with fewer good people, who really do know me.","I'm inspired by anyone who's honest in their own expression, people who truly beat to the rhythm of their own drum.","I grew up not having very many girl friends. Girls tend to be competitive. I actually went to the school 'Mean Girls' was written about, so you can only imagine what my high school experience was like!","In N.Y. you're always around people, but in L.A. you can go days without seeing anyone.","I was more comfortable with guys growing up, but now I find myself more comfortable in my own skin and open to people, regardless of their gender or popularity or any other label, as a result.","I'm always after boys who don't want me, I'll tell you that much!","I've always been a jeans and a T-shirt kind of kid!","I am mad about hats. I collect them as souvenirs from my globe trotting.","I'm in love with dream catchers. I collect them from every trip I take."],"Gin Wigmore":["It's easy listening to a record, but a live performance is so personal and real.","You break up, and you say something pathetic, or you don't even speak at all when someone's telling you they don't love you anymore. But then you think about it five minutes later, and you have all these great comebacks!","I think I was probably a cowboy in a past life.","Being a black sheep is a way I would describe myself.","I was in a band in Auckland, and I remember they all hated me. They had a big intervention. They said, basically, 'Gin, we think you suck.' I was miserable. I cried and cried. But looking back, that taught me about social skills and how to communicate with musicians.","You can't go round looking like a rag.","Honestly, Americans are more open-minded and have the patience and the time for new types of music. In Australia and New Zealand, you must earn your place.","I'm getting all domesticated. I feel like Susie the homemaker.","I don't think I'm a good-enough songwriter.","I'm very open with people, very warm, when I meet them. My fans in particular find that strange and refreshing.","People might think I'm a bit more intimidating than I am.","You just feel better when you look nice.","I've got some real diehards down in New Zealand; I look after them and make sure they always get tickets.","When you're young, you need to be silly and be stupid and not be trying to do that when you're 40 in a red sports car.","When I went to Memphis and Mississippi and Nashville, I learnt the blues is a whole way of life. I don't really have the blues, but I can appreciate the honesty and the simplicity of it.","Writing music is such a freeing exercise, and it's really nice to play in that world of being confident, vengeful - getting back at all the bad boyfriends.","That's the great thing about songwriting: You have that time to have perspective and look back and think about all the things you'd want to say.","I've lived a lot since I was 16, so I've got more things to write about. I've started playing around the world and met some great people along the way who've taught me lots of things.","I remember when I wrote songs when I was about 16, they all sounded the same because I didn't know anything. And all the subject matter was all the same because I hadn't actually done much.","I've got a very short attention span, and this has been part of the reason I'm so kind of dumbfounded at the fact that I've still stayed with music. Nothing has ever stuck for me, and music's the only thing that's managed to stick out for a long period of time.","I'm a big believer that when we put so much into our jobs - and everyone does - you deserve to be get paid for it instead of doing a gig and then having to work in a bar for eight hours.","My dad dying was actually a reason for me to stop music properly for about a year, because he was a big supporter. All I wanted to do was write a song about him and, you know, when something's too fresh, you can't quite word it.","I want to let everyone hear my music and enjoy it, but just as long as it's fun. I'll go as far as until it gets too much like a day job.","I don't think I'm a diva.","I'm not aiming to be someone like Christina Aguilera.","I want a long career in music, so you've gotta keep trying things out; it's gotta get progressively better.","I'm just going to tour; that's the best way for people to get to know me. Focusing on the international stuff and breaking in to the States and U.K.","I love playing shows. That's the time I have to really share what I am about.","I listened to John Denver and Simon & Garfunkel. Edith Piaf was a huge favourite. Then I discovered musicals - I loved 'Les Miserables' - and, at about 14, I started listening to David Gray.","The beauty of being a musician is writing songs. That's the best part. It's therapeutic and honest and private.","No one can attack you when you're songwriting; it's you and a song, which is a great place to be.","I try not to think too much about where my voice comes from. I'm channeling characters and emotion to come up with beautiful words that tell a story.","I'd say the key thing is to remain true to what originally got you into music. When I wrote 'Hallelujah,' it ignited me to do music because of the love and joy that I got from writing that song. Down the road, you get all of these opinions from people; just remember what got you started in the first place.","I got down to business and started writing furiously. I wore my fingers down to a callous state writing with every Tom, Dick and Harry around the world, including a chap named Charlie who plays for a man named Bob, to wrestle my emotions and bring out the raw grit hiding in my tightly guarded sub-conscious.","I love the energy in the U.S., you know. Everyone is really psyched. You feel really privileged to be there.","That would be awesome, to be totally making records whenever I want and to play a show and have a few hundred thousand people there at any city you go to because people know you and your music."],"Gina Barreca":["It's not that diamonds are a girl's best friend, but it's your best friends who are your diamonds. It's your best friends who are supremely resilient, made under pressure and of astonishing value. They're everlasting; they can cut glass if they need to.","Like love, breakfast is best when made at home.","If you believe that your best years are behind you, you've guaranteed they are; I'm going to dance into that good night, with the oldies turned up loud.","Laughing together is as close as you can get to a hug without touching.","Birthdays are a reward for having shown up 365 days in a row. It's like getting a badge for attendance.","The '60s had edge; the '70s had embroidery.","Once we hit forty, women only have about four taste buds left: one for vodka, one for wine, one for cheese, and one for chocolate.","Two things I do for maintenance: I get a manicure once a month, and I see my therapist about every six weeks. I am happy to report that, at this point, my nails crack more often than I do.","We should learn to take genuine pride in a job well done and not expect praise for one simply carried out.","I'm pretty much done with mindfulness. I'm just going to start paying attention.","Recognizing your talents doesn't mean believing they're limitless. Accepting your strengths doesn't lead to pride, but instead to humility; you're less likely to resent what others have if you understand your own bounty.","I see taking care of my emotional and mental health in the same way that I see taking care of a garment: After it's been through wear and tear, it needs attention.","If you know you can do it - if you can already chart every day in your future - then why bother? Choose to do something you have more trouble imagining. Take a chance.","I regard other women as my community, not my competition.","My longing to improve my looks via The Body Shop is being replaced by my longing to improve my looks via Photoshop.","From age 16 to age 20, a woman's body is a temple. From 21 to 45, it's an amusement park. From 45 on, it's a terrarium.","Here's something women need to stop doing to other women: We need to stop asking each other to lower our fees, cut our rates or work for free because we're members of the same sex.","Women feel like we're fat if we can't wear the clothes we wore in high school. Men, in contrast, only start to feel fat only when they can no longer fit into a foreign car.","My cat is older than many fashion models. I won't even discuss the fact that she also weighs more.","My mother thinks Mick Jagger is a foreign car.","For many of us, our proms were less Walt Disney's 'Cinderella' and more Stephen King's 'Carrie.' The less we spent on them, the better.","Almost 30 years ago, I started seeking help from a counselor with a master's of social work in New York City, but we were never a good match. It was like being in a bad relationship, except the guy could actually bill my health insurance company for lousy dates.","Every patient tends to bury the most important story inside some other story, just the way new writers often 'bury the lede.' 'Burying the lede' is an old journalism term for when you only find out the real point about halfway into the article, but it also applies to therapy.","Sometimes things can take a very long time and still not be very good. It took us all of evolutionary history just to get where we are today, for instance, and mostly where we are today is on the couch.","I passed my classes because I displayed effort, not because I learned math. But how can we help young people understand life rarely gives partial credit for effort, especially if that effort doesn't lead to understanding or success?"],"Gina Bellman":["I love those connections that make this big old world feel like a little village.","I eat tons, three full meals a day, and I never go to the gym. When I was a child, my geography teacher said, 'You may be slim now but if you carry on eating like that, you'll end up being really fat.' Fortunately, I really don't think I've changed much in the past two decades, so that teacher was an idiot.","It's always fun messing around with costumes and stuff. You know there is an element of acting that you've got to dress-up; that's part of it.","I started elocution lessons because I was being teased, and I had a brilliant drama teacher. At the age of 14, I appeared at the National Theatre in 'The Crucible.'","Any friendship or relationship is about a language.","Every person has parallel tracks. You have your personal life or your life as an artist, or whatever it is you do.","I think there was a petition online to get me involved in 'Doctor Who.' I'm not a 'Doctor Who' fanatic, but I am a Steven Moffat fanatic.","I don't like dressing up, and I don't like putting on make-up or doing the red carpet. The only red carpet events I go to are if I'm supporting a friend.","I don't like crowds or attention.","I've had my taste of intense fame, and I've got it out of my system. Now I'm free to choose parts which fulfil me in different ways.","French cinema allows women to look... a certain way and be talented at the same time.","The only time I get recognised is when I go somewhere that is showing 'Coupling' on local television.","I love acting, and I have no desire to direct.","There was a time when going out to parties and dinner parties and clubs was an exciting thing to do. I'd wake up in the morning and immediately think, 'Now what am I doing tonight?' Now I'd be more likely to reach for a book.","I carried on acting during school holidays and was all set to go to drama school when I was offered my first professional job appearing in 'King David' with Richard Gere.","I'm not really that keen on mainstream; I'm not interested in doing the normal films. I do tend to go for the quirky, different scripts.","I have always liked family-type dramas; I just think the dynamics in families make for some really interesting characters.","I am a big comedy fan, having been in 'Coupling.'","My all-time favourite programme is 'Seinfeld;' I could just sit and watch that over and over again.","When I had the wonderful occasion to play a goofball, Jane, in 'Coupling,' it was definitely an homage to Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who I just think is a genius.","Some people think it's an easy gig working as an extra, but you often have to stay very concentrated for long stretches in challenging conditions.","In England, I've never had to drive myself to work. I don't think the English producers trust actors to get up at five A.M. and get to the set on time.","My average day on 'Leverage' starts at 5 A. M. and ends 12 to 14 hours later. An hour drive to the set and back sometimes makes the day unbearably long. You have to grab a few minutes to yourself where you can.","One of the things you have to get used to, working on a TV show, is filming out of sync.","One of the things you have to be acutely aware of when shooting episodes out of order is your character's relationship with the other characters.","When I get a new script, I write a record of how many costume and make-up changes I have. I cross-check them against the shooting schedule and then consult with the hair and make-up designers.","There is nothing worse than sitting in the make-up trailer knowing that the whole crew are twiddling their thumbs waiting for you to change your hair from straight to curly or up to down. Sometimes it can't be avoided.","One of the things that takes a bit of getting used to on an American series is having a different director, and often writer, every week.","Some directors are really strong on action, manhandling you around the set; others are very focused on setting up the camera shots and practically ignore you. You have to get used to introverts, extroverts, directors who clown around for the crew, and the odd one who's monosyllabic.","I've never worked in my natural accent, having studied so hard to get rid of it when I moved to England as a child where I was bullied at school for 'talking funny.'","I've now learned that the most stressful day of filming a TV series is the first day of a new episode. You haven't quite banked the one you just wrapped and are wondering, 'Did I do that right?' 'Could I have done that better?'","Every name in a TV show has to be run by the legal department first.","My mother always said I should have a back-up profession if the acting doesn't work out.","When you shoot on high-definition, everything is very sharp and clear, sometimes at the cost of losing dimension and depth of field.","I took part in two 'Leverage' conventions. Fans fly in from as far as Russia and Australia. It's expensive to attend.","Fans believe they have a relationship with you, either through your TV character or, more reasonably, through the tweets you may have exchanged. In a way, you have gotten to know them. You learn about people's kids, families, pets.","Not surprisingly, there is a cultural divide between American and British actors regarding the self-promotion associated with new media.","Many American TV actors employ agents, managers, business managers, publicists and stylists, and are now adding digital media manager to the list. Their job is to reach out to the fans, managing websites, Twitter feeds, Facebook and Wikipedia."],"Gina Carano":["Since I've started fighting it has taught me a lot about self respect, self confidence and self control.","You shouldn't be greedy. You should feel good about yourself and not be greedy of what other people have.","Fighting is very physical and extreme and you're very vulnerable. It's a very mental type of thing.","I think I came up in fighting in a really technical way. If you've ever seen my fights, you know I love distance, I love technique.","My knowledge of video games ends with Nintendo 'Mario Bros.'","I am always training because I love it.","My last fight wasn't the way I wanted it to go so there is a hole there; don't count me out.","I think there's a part in each one of us that wants the impossible to happen, and that's what surprises are.","I have gotten some of the most beautiful experiences that a person can possibly ask for so I'm not at all complaining.","My first fight. I fought a girl that was a little bit heavier, a little bit more experienced and I was petrified because I didn't know what I was getting myself into. And I did really well against her and nobody believed it was my first fight.","I know I don't look like the skinny slender model. I know I look a little different but people like to watch me for some reason. It feels good and I'm humbled by it.","It's a very big deal to me to remain the same person because I know all of this is going to be gone one day and I'm just going to have myself.","On 'American Gladiators,' I got to pummel a lot of people off a pyramid with a giant Q-tip. It was so much fun to wrestle people with no risk of getting knocked out or choked out.","You want to get better even after people smash you down. You want to be better than you were before.","It's a constant battle for everybody, but you need to be happy with yourself.","I definitely don't want to be one of those athletes who turns into a cheesy actress.","I am not a violent person. I actually don't like to hurt people.","The guys I date always want to test my strength and wrestle around. By the end, they're drenched in sweat.","I like fighting because it's honest.","I wake up every morning and I surprise myself. I wake up to a new me.","There are certain things that I always dreamed of, like fighting in the UFC. There's just certain things that I feel like haven't been accomplished there. There's such great women coming up in the sport; seems like a wonderful time to be in women's MMA.","When I throw a punch, I mean it.","Well you know, I have the utmost respect for people like Angelina Jolie and Zoe Saldana in 'Colombiana. '","Fighting is my career, it's what I love to do, but I am taking offers and trying to expand because the more I expand myself, the more valuable I become to promoters.","I don't get paid what people think I get paid for fighting.","The ultimate first date? Something that is completely out of the ordinary - go crazy, because first dates are always a little awkward, so do something a little extreme.","I find that whoever you are as a person is how you're gonna fight, and every basic instinct kind of comes out at that moment.","I didn't really watch action films growing up! I grew up on stuff like 'Anne of Green Gables' - that was more when I was in elementary school. It was all I ever watched.","Sometimes, you get portrayed the way you don't want to be portrayed.","I want people to see me for who I am and not for how someone else is trying to promote me.","I don't mind answering any questions, because I'm not just a fighter. I'm a lot more than that.","I know I'm always rooting for the underdog in a fight, and I love to be constantly surprised.","My mom used to tell me: 'It's not what you weigh; it's what you look like.'","I was always bigger than the other girls. My sisters are very, very beautiful and very skinny, and I've always had a more muscular body. So I grew up with a different mentality.","I've had cameras on me since I started the art of fighting and I think that I'm used to having cameras on me in adrenaline-type situations.","Of course, fighting is not going to be as graceful as movie fighting. I don't like it to be ugly and I don't like it to be one big brawl or people clobbering each other.","A lot of people enjoyed the film 'Haywire' and a lot of people have mixed feelings on it but regardless, a lot of people have said really wonderful things about it being my first experience, that the fighting they absolutely enjoyed. So I think I've gotten a lot more fans, actually.","I'm really surprised how many people knew me as Gina Carano. MMA has a beautiful fan base.","Everybody is their own critic.","When I enjoy doing something, I don't mind if it hurts."],"Gina Gershon":["My favorite part of a roller-coaster ride is when you're going up and you're slightly scared and really excited. You don't know what's coming next but you know it's going to be good. You can't handle it, go on the carousel.","My best attribute is knowing when not to answer stupid questions.","I think people stop themselves from doing the things they want to do. I just think you never know how long you're going to be around so you might as well do the things that are intriguing. Nobody really cares anyway so you have to do what makes you happy.","I love giving gifts and I love receiving them. I really like giving little kids extravagant gifts. You see their little faces light up and they get excited. If it's a really good gift, I love receiving it, like jewels, small islands.","Struggling at anything that you want to be doing is hard.","Feeding is a very important ritual for me. I don't trust people who don't like to eat.","I did the cover of Cigar Aficionado, so I'm supposed to talk about loving cigars. I've smoked them a couple of times. My father used to smoke cigars. I love the idea and the concept, and I love the smell of cigars.","Size counts. That's all.","I always find people who are unique very attractive.","You don't quite know how drunk you are until all of a sudden you're on the floor.","A lot of my friends are struggling musicians. Being a struggling actor, it's just frustrating because you're not allowed to do what you want to do.","I feel like I still am struggling in a lot of different ways. I still have to fight for certain things. Certain jobs. At least I'm working and I'm thankful for that.","I think the original Matrix was really incredible. It was so original and it did so many innovative things with film. It was a much bigger film. Bound was just a smaller film. It was kind of like an old noir film.","The critics tend to forget their own answers after a while.","I learned a lot about critics, not to really take them too seriously about movies.","I think smart is sexy. I like smart people. People that are comfortable with themselves I think is very sexy. My cat is really sexy.","I'm involved in Project ALS which is trying to get money for stem cell research. That's one I've been pretty involved with because if you can cure that, you can cure so many other diseases.","I don't have any blonde friends.","I love cats. I have a lot of cat tales, ha ha, so to speak. A lot of my cats come to me. They show up at my house. I'm kind of a cat lady that way.","I usually just have one cat. It is difficult, but I have my one cat that he'll travel with me if it's appropriate, if I'm not going overseas.","I would love to do a big studio movie, just because they're going to put the money into distributing it. A lot of times you do these little movies, you love them and they never get seen by anyone.","When Bound was released, Boys don't Cry wasn't out yet. Therefore it was very taboo to play a lesbian. I loved the part, because girls never get to play the typical guy parts.","In any profession, there's a sleazy side and an honorable side.","I was obsessed with Elvis Presley when I was little.","People seem to get weirdly obsessed with my mouth.","Actresses are nightmares. I don't hang out with any of them. That's a problem with my profession. I try not to be like an actress.","Lately, I've been a little sad that I'm not a gay man.","I've seen it too many times in Hollywood. Talking about a relationship in public can jinx it. And if you have your picture taken together, you might as well start packing your bags."],"Gina Holden":["As far back as I can remember, I wanted to dance, sing and perform.","Although I did end up trying out several different fields before committing to acting, I knew in the deepest part of heart that I wanted to be an actress.","I've been fortunate to play many different types of characters thus far. However, I really enjoy playing roles that are different than who I am personally. You can have these small fantasy worlds where you can be people you would otherwise never get to be: a doctor, a lawyer, a ruthless business woman.","I absolutely love any kind of outdoor activities like snowboarding, hiking, surfing, and laying out on the beach if I ever get the time... which is not often!","My brother is my go-to with scripts, especially when we're talking genre pieces, because I want to make sure that it's legit. I can love it, but then I pass stuff on to him.","I certainly do all sorts of work. I'm very, very blessed to do drama and other types of television, and things like that, but I always go back to sci-fi, whenever possible, because that's really exciting for me.","It's hard because I seek out strong female roles. I turn down a lot of stuff, not because it's not good, but because I don't want to play certain types of characters. I don't like to just play the pretty girl.","When I'm watching TV, I'm always drawn to those female characters who are doing something that I would want to do."],"Gina Lollobrigida":["A woman at 20 is like ice, at 30 she is warm and at 40 she is hot.","I do what I like now. I just don't have time for it all."],"Gina McCarthy":["States with tremendous oil and natural gas reserves have the most to gain economically from proper regulation.","Greenhouse gas pollution, through its contribution to global climate change, presents a significant threat to Americans' health and to the environment upon which our economy and security depends.","When discussing overall impacts on employment, it is important not to overlook the new technologies and industries that can be driven by pollution control standards.","The EPA's greenhouse gas regulations, along with a host of other onerous regulations, are unnecessarily driving out conventional fuels as part of America's energy mix. The consequences are higher energy prices for families and a contraction of our nation's economic growth.","Proponents of efficiency standards argue that they save consumers and businesses money, reduce energy use, and reduce emissions. But families and businesses already understand how energy costs impact their lives and make decisions accordingly.","When consumers do not take full advantage of efficiency gains, it is because they are weighing other factors that influence their decision making. When the federal government arbitrarily places one of those factors over others, it makes consumers worse off.","There is no threshold level of fine particle pollution below which health risk reductions are not achieved by reduced exposure.","I love disagreements. I love the democratic process. If I'm in a room where everybody agrees, I start to nod off.","I cannot shy away from controversy. I don't know if it's my Irish blood, but I love it.","Even if there's controversy, I'm going to make the decision, and people are going to be happy in one instance and unhappy in the next. But that's the job I've been given and the job I'm going to embrace.","I definitely challenge people. But hopefully, I am working harder than anybody else, and so people won't resent the fact that I want them to work hard, as well."],"Gina McKee":["There are different definitions of love, and one of the most wonderful definitions of love is to allow somebody to be.","A distant cousin sent me some genealogy report on my father's side, and it's sort of what I suspected. Coal miners for generations... four or maybe five generations.","I was one of those kids who found it difficult to eat anything that looked like an animal.","My instinct is probably one of the strongest assets I've got, workwise.","Being an actor somehow can be a perverse extension of that feeling we generally all have as children, that feeling of wanting to please. Of course you're looking for affirmation, encouragement.","The National Youth Theatre did one very simple but incredible thing for me: it made me realise I had choices.","I love that, even after jumping through hoops forever, I can still get that buzz, that hook. That's very healthy, but it's bittersweet, too, because if you don't get the part, you have to deal with the disappointment. I don't think I'll ever negotiate those peaks and troughs wholly healthily.","I think it's nice to be able to make a product, put it out there and let other people decide what they think.","I think I'm very open and friendly and warm.","I'm extremely self-critical. Although I try not to be ridiculous about it, wearing horsehair shirts and all that. It's a private exercise I don't necessarily share with other people.","Usually I can go for three or four weeks and then I start to bake cakes or make jewellery and I think, 'hang on a minute, I'm obviously bored rigid. I need to get back out there.'","I've had two instances when I've met journalists face to face and we've had good interviews and I've said, 'We don't have children, by the way,' and then they've written it. I'm not sure what that's about. As misleading facts go, it's not a terrible one but it isn't true - we don't have kids.","I don't feel comfortable talking about my private life, and some people in my private life don't feel comfortable about me talking about it. So I don't.","The first time I came to London on my own, I was 15. I was absolutely oblivious to so many things. I had no expectations, no fears. I just came to do a National Youth Theatre season one summer. It was just brilliant.","There's a way of negotiating how you portray your private life publicly that I've never had the skill to do.","Where I grew up in the North-east, the community there, and the way people relate to one another, goes very deep. But I don't define myself as a Northerner in that I don't live in the North."],"Gina Neely":["'Down Home with the Neelys' was the highest-rated Food Network show in history. But the crazy part about it was I never wanted to do that show. I never wanted to live my life quite out loud like that.","This new ministry of all this swiping and Tinder and matchmaking and Date.com and eHarmony, I'm still old-school. I like to meet people face to face.","Cooking has always sort of been my way to soothe the soul, if you will. I grew up around my great-great-grandmother cooking, and that's eventually where I learned a lot of things. So food has always been used to ease and comfort.","You cannot be in your 50s and not change your diet. That ministry won't work. You can't keep eating burgers and fries and thinking you're going to look cute and fabulous and trying to squeeze into that little black dress.","I say now, if I'm not laughing a whole lot on the first date, you're pretty much not going to get a second one, I can tell you that. It's all about the laughter and a good time for me.","If kids cook with you and participate with you, to me that makes them more apt to eat the food. They feel like they made the dish; they want to taste it. It's special, It's an effort.","I think, for me, since I've always had a busy lifestyle, I try to take out a little time for me and exercise and do things that are good for me, because if I'm not good, then I can't extend that out to my family.","Life happens, honey. What are you going to do? Cry in a bowl of milk?","You don't stop living because bad things happen. You keep going.","I'm a pasta girl, and I like dishes that are easy, one-pot dishes that are really quick.","I want to get married again. I love being married. I'm not against marriage, and I'm not against love.","For me, being a public persona, I was always wondering, 'Was a man dating me for who I was? Was there an agenda? Did he want to be seen with me? Am I arm candy?'","I need a man that's comfortable in his skin and not threatened by a woman with a big personality.","I think as we get older, we need a little weight on us to fill us out and make us look healthier.","We cook for so many reasons. We cook when we're sad; we cook when we're happy.","I love spinach - I eat it like a crazy woman.","Skillet corn bread has always been my go-to-comfort food, and my mom used to make it for me as a treat when I was younger. I do this for my girls now whenever I think they need a little love.","All Southern cooks have tried their hands at shrimp and grits, and each one has his or her own version of the dish. My mom used to season her shrimp with garlic and onion and just prepare the grits with a little salt and pepper."],"Gina Philips":["All these horror movies are slasher film now. I like them, they're fun, but they wink at the audience and you're really not terrified through the movie.","I think suspense is a big thing.","I think there is a feeling of old Hitchcock in there. There are parts that are tributes to some of the old great horror movies and the old great filmmakers.","I'm a horror movie fanatic.","It's up to each person's parents whether they think it's too frightening or too violent, how much their kids can handle, what they want to teach them, what they want to show them.","Number one is that it just scares people! Your hair is standing up on your arms, or at least that there's a few moments when you're jumping. That's what makes it a good horror movie."],"Gina Prince-Bythewood":["Improv is a very big thing for me. The thing with actors is I do not understand at all how they do what they do. I'm fascinated by it, and I have such a respect for it.","Movies have power. Power to impact society and the choices we make. I want to entertain, but I also want to say something to the world.","There are so many romantic comedies made, but very few dramas or love stories. And with a love story, you have to take time to develop three-dimensional characters.","'Out of Sight' is one of my favorite films ever. Love Steven Soderbergh. 'Goodfellas' was a huge influence on me in terms of the use of camera. 'Black Orpheus,' a beautiful love story that very few people actually have seen, and that was an influence on 'Beyond the Lights,' too, in terms of the look of the film.","I was adopted by a Salvadorian mother and a white father. Growing up having complete identity crisis. Then my search for my mother and trying to find out why I was given up, and how could a mother give up a child, then finding out the circumstances of my birth was pretty traumatizing.","I write to music, and Nina Simone is always on my playlist to write to. I mean, she's inspiring. She's truthful and real and raw.","On my set, people have to respect the actor's process. I totally respect what actors do. I give them whatever time they need, and I never scream out directions from the camera. I take the time to walk up to them and talk to them personally.","'Black film,' that term allows studios to just marginalize a movie and say, 'We've made our black film. We've made our film with people of color in it,' as opposed to, 'I just feel like people of color should be in every genre.'","There is a blueprint that young female singers seem to follow to make it, to make some noise when they first come out. And it's a hyper-sexualized persona. And the thing is that it works. And they do make noise. But the problem is if it's not authentic to you, then you're trapped in that persona. And you have to live that persona 24/7.","With 'Love And Basketball,' every studio turned it down.","When 'The Cosby Show' came out, and everyone was up in arms about 'The Cosby Show' and that it was reflecting a world that didn't exist - but I knew black doctors. And I knew black lawyers. And I knew families that, you know, had a mother and a father and kids that were well-behaved.","As an audience member, if I go to a film, and I am watching two actors, and they're kissing, and it looks like they don't even want to be kissing, it just takes me out of the film.","With 'Love & Basketball,' I played ball my whole life and did track at UCLA. So, I'm an athlete. And it was very important for me to get it right. I started with casting: As an athlete, there's nothing worse for me than watching a sports movie and the woman that they hire can't run or can't shoot. It sets women's sports back years.","I love movies. And I dig a great love story: the kind that wrecks me, then builds me back up and leaves me inspired. I write what I want to see.","'Beyond the Lights' took incredible fight to get made. Four years of writing and two years of overcoming 'no.' Every studio balked. Twice. But I kept fighting. What gave me the courage was 'Love & Basketball.' Every studio turned down that film, too. But I never gave up because I believed in it with my whole heart and soul.","There is a perception within our community and the world that black people don't love each other. That we don't fight for each other. That perception is so dangerous. We need positive images to counter the negative portrayals we see every day. And positive doesn't mean perfect. Perfect is boring.","There's a great deal of women in film school. I was not the only woman in my class at UCLA. When I went through the Sundance program, it was half women and half men.","I just remember when I came out of film school - and I loved film school - that the industry was such a mystery. How to break in, and once you are in, how to make a film; that is such a large undertaking. There are thousands of pitfalls.","'Beyond the Lights' was my fourth film. I gained a lot of knowledge, and I'm excited to share that with young filmmakers because I know how lost I was coming out of film school with that question of 'What's next?'","Talent has no gender. People are hiring young male directors right out of film school, off of a student film or off of a film at Sundance for millions of dollars. You can do the same with a female. It's not a risk about the work if you respect the film that they made.","I don't want people to go to a film of mine because they feel guilty, like, 'I have to support it because there's black folks in there.' I want them to go because it's a good movie.","Some of my favorite films are musicals, like 'Walk the Line,' 'The Rose' and 'Lady Sings the Blues.' I just love the way the music and the story fuel each other.","I was adopted by two amazing people: a Salvadoran mother and a white father who were incredibly supportive of me and my work. I am eternally grateful for them.","I hate to fly. I'm deathly afraid of it.","The thing is I write to music, so every script I have has its own playlist. Music just opens me up to the emotions that I'm writing. It's just a pretty cool thing.","I remember sitting in the theater watching 'Bridesmaids,' and I'm doubled over laughing, and then I'm crying in the same movie. It's the overwhelming feeling, as I'm looking up and seeing these women, and I'm realizing how rare it is to see that.","Oh my God, I love UCLA so much. Their film school is great because it's unstructured, so there's a freedom to fail in there and just tell your story, and everybody makes a film. It's so important to have that freedom in film school because that's what you're there for: to learn and make a film.","Twitter and social media have so changed the game for filmmakers, but especially for artists. It shrinks the world and gives chance to feel like they know you. But it's a blessing and a curse. It can help build you up, but there's also such anonymity.","I love writing and directing because it's great therapy. Every project I've done, there's been a personal connection.","Films really can change a conversation and change someone's thinking and perception, especially with people of color at the center. It rarely happens. I think it's important for both the community but also the world to see people of color in all genres, especially love stories.","If I get a note on my script or my films, what I say to a studio executive is that, 'You know, this is the film of my legacy, and I never want to be sitting in a theater looking up on the screen and seeing something that I don't believe in.' I will never do that.","Everything I've written has been personal and touched on things that I needed to deal with in my personal life. So I just feel that writing is great therapy, and the best writing comes from truth, and so I mine my life constantly for that.","There are a lot of aspects of filmmaking that I love, but one of my favorites is in post, finding the right song for the right moment.","I grew up with white parents, and until after college, it was a lot of confusion, especially because I grew up in an all-white area. So I never looked around and saw anyone who looked like me.","My husband and I are writers, and I wish I could write faster. There are not a lot of movies made with black actors in mind."],"Gina Raimondo":["We've just got to keep going. More. More work, more action, more results.","I respect public employees and school teachers. They deserve a secure retirement.","The difference between a dream and a goal is a deadline.","My vision for a better Rhode Island starts with a simple idea - we are all in this together.","I fall into the camp that income inequality is the biggest problem we face.","Budgets that don't balance, public programs that aren't funded, pension funds that are running out of money, schools that aren't funded - How does that help anyone?","Those diplomas on my wall would not be there without the GI Bill that educated my father, without the public library, without the RIPTA bus.","Maybe you think, 'I'm not college material.' Maybe you worry that you don't have the money. Then you take the SAT. You see that colleges are getting in touch with you. You begin to think maybe you are ready for college.","What we have to do is support business, but also support our workers with job training programs and with reasonable wages.","You can't be a progressive and be opposed to pension reform.","Don't ignore big problems, and don't try to pretend that problems are smaller than they are.","People deserve to see a governor who is hustling every day.","The public bus is how I got to school every day.","There's lots of people driving on the roads who don't have licenses. They're still going to work, still going to school. I want them to get a license and insurance so they're driving safely.","I want to show two things. One, that Democrats can solve big problems and get things done. And two, that as a public official, you can make tough choices, do the right things for the right reasons, and upset some people. And still get elected.","Businesses want to be in places where there is a deep talent pool.","Programs like ACE's Bootstrap Summer Camp teach our kids important computer coding skills that will allow them to design their own futures.","In business, we use certain principles to measure performance, and I envision applying those principles in the public sector.","I want to hold government accountable and help create a more efficient and effective government.","If you want to have a big impact, government is the way to do it. Just think of the number of people you can touch.","I've done a lot of deals, and I'm skilled at negotiating, managing personalities, and getting parties to the table.","We can just keep doing it the way we're doing it. We can attack everybody for small-minded things and crush everybody with a new idea. And where are we going to be? Where we are now - behind. Or we can embrace new things and try to be positive and let everybody play a role.","The single greatest under-utilized resource we have as a nation is women and girls.","If we could find a way to totally empower half of the brains in America, imagine how much more productive we could be.","Every single day I've been governor, I hear from a little girl who thinks it's the greatest thing ever that we have a woman governor.","Democrats and all public servants just need to be honest. If we have schools that aren't working ... we need to face the facts and fix them.","Almost every day, people will say to me some version of, 'You're so much nicer in real life.' I guess I come across as not nice.","I guess whenever I'm in the paper, it's dealing with bridges falling apart, budget problems, pension crises - and saying we have to tackle these problems.","The governor's not allowed to drive. That's part of the life you accept.","I've been told I'm a workaholic.","A government that doesn't work is in no one's interest.","I don't really care if you're a Republican or Democrat or you want to fight about the size of government. How about a government that just works? Put your tax dollar in and get a return out the other end.","If I'm a CEO, I want to be in a place where the government works.","During my four years as treasurer, we restructured our pension system, cutting the state's unfunded liability almost by half and putting our retirement system on stronger footing.","We know businesses can't compete without reliable infrastructure.","Fixing the pension system was one of the biggest problems Rhode Island faced.","My own rhetoric is not so 'us versus them.' I don't like fighting.","I am a mother with kids in the public schools. People should know that. I'm not just some policy maker who's totally detached from the rest of the community.","If you have the talent, you should have the opportunity.","I'm going to ask one question for everything that comes across my desk, which is, 'How is this going to create jobs?'","People deserve to see progress.","The public library is where I studied. It's where my grandfather taught himself English.","I still believe in the power of government to make lives better, and I believe that if someone is willing to take a stand, other people will follow.","The combination of funding for our ports, airports, and highways is a really significant investment in our infrastructure.","I'm committed to structural changes.","Before I was State Treasurer, my Rhode Island business helped create over 1,000 jobs, including here at Nabsys, a biomedical company. As governor, I'll use this as a model for how we create manufacturing jobs.","I'll bring colleges and industry together to develop new products in marine science, green technology, and medical devices, and to train our workers to fill those jobs... We need to get Rhode Islanders back to work.","In many cases, Rhode Island is just not on the radar of a lot of companies. But once companies or people take the time to look at our high quality of life, low cost of living, great talent, good business environment, often people see it's an excellent place, and they want to take a harder look.","We have to slowly, carefully, and thoughtfully align all of our interests.","I want to be able to look my daughter's teacher in the eye and say, 'Your pension will be there.' I need to know that her pension will match up with a promise we can keep.","I care about buses and libraries and schools and roads and education.","It's all about the choices we make as a society. We can choose to have poor schools and parks and higher tuition at Rhode Island's colleges. But we should make an active choice.","Let's make the SAT and PSAT free so everyone has a chance to succeed.","We need a collective moment where we commit ourselves to long-term solutions.","I am a proponent of investing in infrastructure... and, if we can use state resources to make ProvPort more prosperous and successful, then that will benefit the whole state.","People talk about Social Security. There is no parallel between Rhode Island's pension and Social Security.","You can raise taxes on the rich in America! We should raise taxes on the rich in America. But we can't do that in Rhode Island.","I think the Founding Fathers probably knew what they were doing in setting up the government to have a healthy tension between the executive branch and the legislative branch.","We have to get past this persistent negativity. The negativity has held Rhode Island back for a long time."],"Gina Rinehart":["There is no monopoly on becoming a millionaire. If you're jealous of those with more money, don't just sit there and complain - do something to make more money yourself.","If you want to help the poor and our next generation, make investment, reinvestment and businesses welcome.","The millionaires and billionaires who chose to invest in Australia are actually those who most help the poor and our young. This secret needs to be spread widely.","I think my father is nearly perfect. I think he's quite handsome, except a bit fat.","I have never met a geologist or leading scientist who believes adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere will have any significant effect on climate change.","The evidence is inarguable that Australia is becoming too expensive and too uncompetitive to do export-oriented business. Africans want to work, and its workers are willing to work for less than $2 per day. Such statistics make me worry for this country's future. We are becoming a high-cost and high-risk nation for investment.","We all know far too many stories where the third generation just destroys everything that the first two have built up, and I certainly hope my family are different because I've worked too hard and my father has worked too hard for it to be given away.","In the U.S. there are many people willing to work on $9 per hour, which is causing Tasmania to lose its famous apple industry and Australia to import more and more of its fruit and food from lower cost countries. In fact, all over Australia there are warning signs of us killing or restricting our own industries."],"Gina Rodriguez":["I try to keep in mind that it's a long journey. It's not a race. It's about staying focused, continuing to do good work, make my family and community proud; that's all I really want to do... and pay my bills.","I like to peel it and share it with friends. You can spread the love with an orange.","I think when you work really hard and you help others, God helps you get what you want.","Every morning, my dad would have me looking in the mirror and repeat, 'Today is going to be a great day; I can, and I will.'","What I will not do is continue to perpetuate stereotypes. I'm the daughter of a maid; why do I have to also play a maid? My mom was a maid so I didn't have to be a maid.","This industry is all about work, and just because Sundance exposed me to the world, it is my job to stay deserving in that world. The work never ends; the hustle just get harder, and you get stronger!","I do not devalue the role of a maid or nanny, or the stereotypical roles that some members of our family have actually done to feed our families in real life.","With each dream accomplished, bigger ones are put in their place.","Acting is how I'll be able to change how Latinos are viewed in media and change how little girls see and talk about themselves.","I've specifically decided to say no to projects that weren't advancing Latinos, that weren't showing us in a positive light, roles that were gratuitous and spreading untruths.","I love telling stories that allow people to be less afraid to tell theirs.","I've been very lucky; God has done amazing things for me.","What makes characters real are details, and if you're crafting a person from scratch, you're probably not going to pay as much attention to a question like, 'Does this person bite their nails?'","I am not going to take a role because there's money. It might extend my checkbook, but not my integrity.","I love relatable stories.","I started salsa dancing with a few different companies and started touring the country. It was fantastic, but I realized that I really wanted to talk every time we were performing. That's a problem because when you're dancing, if you stop to talk, that's not really cool to the other dancers.","I started performing very young as a salsa dancer, and every time I was on that stage dancing, all I knew was that I wanted to speak. I wanted the music to stop, and I wanted to speak.","I've learned a lot about what kind of actor I want or do not want to be while being on set. I sit back and observe how other actors treat the totem pole of set politics.","I don't want the Latino community to think I think the reason Latino films are not doing well is because of us. It is not fully our responsibility.","Latinos don't go out and support their own films, but at the same time, it's not their responsibility.","I think all Latino actors want to be storytellers first. I want to be an actor first, and then I want to be Latina.","I will play the characters with last names like Sanchez and Gonzalez until the day I die, but I also want to play the 'Michelle Smiths.'","I dream big, baby. I want to do thrillers, I want to do smart David Lynch-type mysteries.","I can live in L.A. as a struggling artist. I cannot live in New York as a struggling artist.","I grew up dancing salsa - you know, a traditional Puerto Rican dance.","I grew up in Chicago, so hip-hop has always been a part of my life.","I went to college at NYU for acting, since acting was my dream from very young. I did a lot of hip-hop courses while I was there. I helped co-write a hip-hop production for the main stage of NYU, but I never touched rap.","I'm not messing with skiing. You can't get this Puerto Rican on the slope. Uh-uh.","'Filly Brown' gave me the wings to fly, but red carpets are still very uncomfortable.","I felt very vulnerable after 'Sleeping with the Fishes'; I gained weight for the role. I felt a bit out of my skin in the movie, and it was hard to watch.","I learned a lot from Ana Ortiz, who plays my sister in 'Sleeping with the Fishes'.","I started small with commercials and print.","I was a salsa dancer for the majority of my life, from, like, 7 to 17, and did the World Salsa Congresses. I realized that I wanted to continue obviously to be a performer. But in my household, being an actor and jumping into acting is not really accepted.","When I got out of college, I booked a movie called 'Go for It!' with Lionsgate, came out here, and I've been acting ever since - or trying, constantly trying.","Being an actress wasn't realistic. I knew that I was going to have to do it in a way that would speak to my parents. So I went to NYU Tisch School of the Arts for theater, and I studied at the conservatory.","Being half Jewish, we grew up with Christmas trees but had Jewish ornaments."],"Gina Torres":["I don't tweet - I have nothing to say.","I certainly came up in an era where women were really making strides and making a point to beat down doors and find their place and crash through the glass ceiling.","My view of myself doesn't change. I know who I am. I'm Cuban American; both my parents are Cuban - one was a little browner than the other one. That's who I am. I feel sorry that it's taken so long for the film industry to figure it out and to catch up.","You have Showtime, you have AMC, you have all of these, you know, incredible networks that are now bringing forth their product without the handcuffs, if you will, of trying to sell soap to the entire country.","I have been very, very fortunate on this show, on 'Suits,' where the writers do come to me, and they ask my comfort level and, if they want to push an envelope in a certain direction, if I'm okay with that. And, by and large, I am. I think it's important.","When it was announced that I was going to be on 'Castle,' there were immediate messages on all the TV news sites from 'Firefly' fans hoping for a nod to the series - some encrypted business just for them! I can't promise that, but I can say that a few people out there might get a thrill."],"Ginevra Elkann":["It's important to show that creativity is in many different sectors, not just in graphic design or filmmaking.","I'm very fortunate, as there are a lot of people who work with me; otherwise, I'd never be able to do it.","The fact is that creativity is everywhere. It's just about the way that you look at things.","I want to make films with a broad scope; produced in Italy but looking at the world.","I know Louboutin extremely well. He has a mind and a vision of life that is extremely creative. He designs his shops, his homes, the way he lives.","The press always compared my family to the Kennedys - so much bad luck.","My mother was very good about giving us a life that was, let's say, as normal as it could be, not a crazy jetting life at all. That's been helpful. It's given me the drive to be someone in the world rather than just sitting around.","It's easier to be the granddaughter of an icon than her daughter.","I try for my children to have the most normal life. Obviously, they're spoiled. I'm not saying they're not, because we're all very spoiled. But within that, I'd like them to be as down-to-earth as possible.","I don't have a supermodel body. I'm always trying to hide something.","My grandmother has a great aesthetic sense. Unfortunately I didn't inherit it.","I'm tired of relying on someone to drive me around. I just want my freedom.","You can't do more mama than Italian Jewish mama.","It's a really fun thing to do, dressing up.","I used to see an ridiculous quantity of films; I think I saw every possible movie.","I love art, but I'm also interested in people's stories.","'Sunset Boulevard' by Billy Wilder, it's one of my favorite films. I love all the movies from the 1950s."],"Ginger Baker":["If I am playing any music at all it is jazz music.","I think the American government is now the most corrupt government in the world.","I have never had a great love of the music business, I never have.","They credited us with the birth of that sort of heavy metal thing. Well, if that's the case, there should be an immediate abortion.","I'd rather play jazz, I hate rock and roll.","I have never taken more than two weeks to record an album throughout my career."],"Ginger Rogers":["Looking back at my life's voyage, I can only say that it has been a golden trip.","My love for ice cream emerged at an early age - and has never left!","Perhaps I am old-fashioned, but black and white films still hold an affectionate place in my heart; they have an incomparable mystique and mood.","You know, there's nothing damnable about being a strong woman. The world needs strong women. There are a lot of strong women you do not see who are guiding, helping, mothering strong men. They want to remain unseen. It's kind of nice to be able to play a strong woman who is seen.","When two people love each other, they don't look at each other, they look in the same direction.","The only way to enjoy anything in this life is to earn it first.","I believe in dressing for the occasion. There's a time for sweater, sneakers and Levis and a time for the full-dress jazz.","Only I know my life.","Sure, jets are fast and economical, but, oh my, what fun we've lost and what leisure we've sacrificed in the race to efficiency. Somehow, stepping onto a plane and zooming across the United States in a matter of hours doesn't hold a candle to the dear, old-fashioned train ride.","The most important thing in anyone's life is to be giving something. The quality I can give is fun and joy and happiness. This is my gift.","I had been making films for almost ten years, and the head men at RKO thought of me only in terms of musicals. I found no fault with that, except I just couldn't stand being typed or pigeonholed as only a singing and dancing girl. I wanted to extend my range.","The kids today, they think they can dance with their faces.","I traveled with my mother, Lela, and there was never enough money. I always had to roll down my silk stockings and carry a doll when we bought train tickets so I could go half-fare. If we had $3, we always figured how to tip for the trunks and still eat.","I won't go to movies with permissiveness, four-letter words, or violence. Show me 'E.T.' and 'Chariots of Fire' instead. That's entertainment, not exploitation of the human body.","I enjoy sports, and love being involved in any outdoor sport from volleyball to softball. I'm not being immodest when I say I'm a natural athlete.","Over the years, myths were built up about my relationship with Fred Astaire. The general public thought he was a Svengali, who snapped his fingers for his little Trilby to obey; in their eyes, my career was his creation.","Rhythm is born in all of us. To be a desirable dancing partner, you don't have to do all the intricate fancy steps that happen to be in vogue. All you have to do is be a good average dancer, and anybody who spends the time and effort can accomplish this.","People are still people no matter how you cut it.","One thing I turn my back on totally is the unsavory atmosphere at most discos.","At the age of ten, I thought if a boy kissed you on the lips, you would have a baby, and I surely wasn't the only youngster who believed that!","Part of the joy of dancing is conversation. Trouble is, some men can't talk and dance at the same time.","My mother told me I was dancing before I was born. She could feel my toes tapping wildly inside her for months.","I try to feed my hunger rather than my appetite.","I yearned for a long, happy marriage with one person.","My mother was a journalist, so writing is not unnatural to me.","I don't disagree with seeing a Rubens of a nude body, but I don't believe in a nude body in action. With Rubens, thank goodness, they aren't in action.","'Flying Down to Rio' established RKO as a leader in musical film production throughout the 1930s. The film helped to rescue the studio from its financial straits and it gave a real boost to my movie career.","While I was making my solo films, RKO was busily trying to get me and Fred Astaire back together. The studio wanted to capitalize on the success of 'Flying Down to Rio' and realized that the pairing of Rogers and Astaire had moneymaking potential.","I made my last motion picture in March 1965 for Magna Pictures. 'Harlow,' based on the life of actress Jean Harlow... I didn't know at the time that 'Harlow' would be my last motion picture.","My faith in humanity leads me to believe that people are looking for something more elevating than the sordid details of the intimate aspects of one's personal life.","You bring out a lot of your own thoughts and attitudes when acting. I think a great deal of it has to do with the inner you.","Gossip is hardly uplifting.","Like most actors, I've always been grateful for Chinese restaurants; they were often the only places that stayed open late enough for performers to get hot food after the show.","During my seven-year contract with RKO, there were seven different studio presidents, from David O. Selznick to Charles W. Koerner. You literally had to check the name on the door so as not to call the new boss by the former boss's name.","Even married people have differences of opinion, I'm told.","There's a verse in the Bible: 'Those who are barren have more children than those who give birth.' There are young people all over the world who come to me for advice and love. I have all the children I can handle.","I cannot abide stupidity, in myself or in others."],"Ginger Zee":["Depression, for me, has been a couple of different things - but the first time I felt it, I felt helpless, hopeless, and things I had never felt before. I lost myself and my will to live.","If someone hurts me on social media, I want to tell them that they've hurt me. I believe you should say what you're feeling. We should all do that, but what I've also realized is that even a negative comment is from a person who is trying to reach out. When I reply, maybe I'm reminding them that there's a deeper meaning to what they're doing.","I wanted to write a story about my struggles with depression and mental health. It's an issue that needs to be talked about more.","No matter the natural disaster I've covered, whether it's a wildfire or flood, I always come back with a much greater perspective.","Parents just want their baby to be happy and healthy, and we're giving every ounce of ourselves to do that.","At home, my personal life was regularly falling apart, and from childhood on, I had a lot of chaos. I was addicted to chaos; I was addicted to self-harm, and I had to seek help at the hospital.","I didn't choose to get anorexia. I may have made some childhood-like choices to try to control something. 'I know what I'll do: I'll just not eat.' That was the initial point, but then it spiraled and became a disease - not a choice by any means.","Anorexia is a real disease. The choice you do have is asking for help.","There have been struggles and challenges that I have faced that few know about but I hope will help others going through the same thing.","I love the challenge of any adventure.","Making it to the finale of 'Dancing with the Stars' has been a major accomplishment.","People can say whatever they want about me. They can call me ugly. But don't talk about my child.","I understand the atmosphere better than I ever did before. You feel the thermals while paragliding. You are in the clouds. Chasing a storm puts you in front of the cloud, not a book. I hope to learn as I do these things.","I find home renovations almost traumatic. But people can create something great.","I always had becoming a meteorologist as my goal from the second I decided, while I was in school, just to study meteorology.","Immediately surrounding the tranquil eye is the most violent part of the hurricane: the eye wall. The most intense wind speeds at the surface are found there.","I loved watching the base of those thunderstorms, the billowing tops of the cumulonimbus, the lightning that effortlessly lit up the lake and the sky. It was gorgeous, so energetic. I was in love.","It's scary, the way your mind can overpower what is real and what is right.","My professional life, in a strange way, has always been going up, up, up, while my personal life was just the complete opposite.","I've been lucky to find a husband who doesn't judge my past.","The moments before I fall asleep are when my list of things to do attacks my brain.","It's fun being pregnant at the same time as someone as prominent as Kim Kardashian. Seeing her beautiful body change and morph makes me remember mine is doing the same, and although it may not always feel beautiful, it really is.","I've been into fitness since I was 13.","Like most women, I want to stay fashionable during my pregnancy - and on TV, that means coming up with something new to wear every day for at least five months.","To tell your story, you have to include others.","I want people to know me.","People see me for 30 seconds at a time, and they see someone who's got a hair and make-up team that put them together, and they're looking all right in the world, but it's not.","We don't all have perfect lives, even if they are seemingly so.","I fought a disease. I fought a disease called depression that a lot of people fight every single day. And unlike other diseases, there is a stigma surrounding it.","Ten days before I started my job at ABC News, I checked myself into a mental health hospital.","I grew up a 'Ginger,' and I liked having a somewhat unique name.","I don't have anything to prove, but I do like to challenge myself.","Dancing is all about your core.","I started storm-chasing at a young age.","We're all more complex than the person we put out there.","I'm self-deprecating - always.","To witness history and science being made in front of your eyes is the rush.","My stepfather and his large family - The Crafts - are from Chicago, so Chicago has always been home for me.","Meteorologists don't use a script, and most create their own graphics and certainly put together their own forecasts. Most of us went to school to become scientists - at least I did - and studied thermodynamics, physics, and tons of calculus to take this young science to the next level. Our accuracy is amazing and will only continue to improve.","I absolutely love the restaurant industry.","I was, am, and likely forever will be a huge mess.","Every woman who has been pregnant knows that it messes with your mind a little bit. You are suddenly someone else: you are a mother who is now responsible for another human being. That's awesome, but it changes who you are.","I don't think you fully get away from something like the years of depression that I went through.","I didn't study broadcasting in school, but I did a lot of internships, and I dedicated myself so much so that I made my email password 'Todayshow10' because I wanted to be on the 'Today Show' by 2010.","Professional highlight of 2011 was definitely getting the job at ABC.","I've always put my career first, and it has been difficult on my personal life.","I hope weather coverage on a national level will help folks learn to respect the power of severe weather, and weather in general, so more lives are spared.","Ideal day is a hot and humid morning, tornadoes develop, no one gets hurt, and we get to collect data and chase the tornadoes.","The eye of the hurricane forms as air rotates up and out of the hurricane and some of the air that's being spun out of the top of the storm sinks back into the center. This keeps the eye of the storm relatively calm and clear.","I actually think the last time I stood with a race medal around my neck was after an eighth grade cross-country meet. I was gawky and 65 pounds soaking wet, and running 10 miles a day was no big deal.","I have to listen to my body - and it's telling me not to run long distances. So how do you train for a race when you know you won't have the same result as before? And should you even join if you know you can't run the whole race? Absolutely - just run-walk it."],"Ginni Rometty":["The only way you survive is you continuously transform into something else. It's this idea of continuous transformation that makes you an innovation company.","Every day I get to 'Think' and work on everything from digitizing electric grids so they can accommodate renewable energy and enable mass adoption of electric cars, helping major cities reduce congestion and pollution, to developing new micro-finance programs that help tiny businesses get started in markets such as Brazil, India, Africa.","When you remove layers, simplicity and speed happen.","I strongly believe that through dedication and perseverance, one can overcome adversity to achieve success. It is a privilege to accept membership in the Horatio Alger Association, an organization which promotes this principle.","Growth and comfort do not coexist.","Some people call this artificial intelligence, but the reality is this technology will enhance us. So instead of artificial intelligence, I think we'll augment our intelligence.","Above and beyond, not only are we an innovation company, we are in service of our clients.","Don't let others define you. You define yourself.","I learned to always take on things I'd never done before.","The ultimate competitive advantage is being cognitive.","Someone once told me growth and comfort do not coexist. And I think it's a really good thing to remember.","My mom had not worked a day in her life, and then she woke up when I was 15 and found herself with four children, no job, no money. But she set out and made it all OK for us, and from that, I saw that there's no problem that can't be solved.","Be first and be lonely.","I think, given who the IBM target company is, I feel our purpose is to be essential to our clients.","I always say, you know, if I sit here and close my eyes and say, 'When did I learn the most in my life, in my career?' It'll always be when I close them and everything I think of is when I took a risk. It's when I think I learned the most.","IBM's long-standing mantra is 'Think.' What has always made IBM a fascinating and compelling place for me, is the passion of the company, and its people, to apply technology and scientific thinking to major societal issues.","The ability to please your shareholders comes because of what you do for clients.","You've got to keep reinventing. You'll have new competitors. You'll have new customers all around you.","If I have learned nothing else in all my years here, my biggest lesson is you have to constantly reinvent this company. That's how you get to be 103 years old.","You build your own strategy. You don't define it by what another competitor is doing.","Think about when a digital business marries up with what I'll call 'digital intelligence.' It is the dawn of a new era about being a 'cognitive' business. When every product, every service, how you run your company can actually have a piece that learns and thinks as part of it, you will be a cognitive business.","You define yourself by either what your clients want or what you believe they'll need for the future. So: Define yourself by your client, not your competitor.","You make the right decision for the long run. You manage for the long run, and you continue to move to higher value. That's what I think my job is.","And so when I moved to IBM, I moved because I thought I could apply technology. I didn't actually have to do my engineer - I was an electrical engineer, but I could apply it. And that was when I changed. And when I got there, though, I have to say, at the time, I really never felt there was a constraint about being a woman. I really did not.","Whatever business you're in - it doesn't matter - it's going to commoditize over time. It's going to devalue. You've got to keep moving it to a higher value.","Today when I think about diversity, I actually think about the word 'inclusion.' And I think this is a time of great inclusion. It's not men, it's not women alone. Whether it's geographic, it's approach, it's your style, it's your way of learning, the way you want to contribute, it's your age - it is really broad.","When I think of revenue growth, I think of the words 'mix' and 'shift.'","I've made lots of mistakes. Probably the worst one - I would say they tie. It's either when I didn't move fast enough on something, or I didn't take a big enough risk.","As I tell all our folks, the only reason we exist - make no mistake - is our clients.","When you manage your company for long-term shareholders, and you manage the company for clients, two of the biggest stakeholders, you will make the right decisions.","I think 'Actions speak louder than words' is one thing, I think, I always took from my mom. And to this day, I think about that in everything I do.","The amazing thing about IBM is that it's a company where I have had 10 different careers - local jobs, global jobs, technology jobs, industry jobs, financial services, insurance, start-ups, big scale. The network of talent around you is phenomenal.","You can engineer change.","Clients say, 'What's your strategy,' and I say, 'Ask me what I believe first.' That's a far more enduring answer.","We should prepare our future workforce differently. It isn't just advanced STEM degrees. There are many jobs you can do without advanced degrees.","I've been head of strategy at IBM and together with my colleagues built our five-year plan. My priorities are going to be to continue to execute on that.","You have to stick up for what you believe in. And that, to me, is the biggest thing you can do about driving inclusion.","What has always made IBM a fascinating and compelling place for me is the passion of the company, and its people, to apply technology and scientific thinking to major societal issues.","I make time to exercise. It's not being indulgent. I think it's got a lot to do with your ability to manage properly and stay focused. There's no doubt about that.","I don't think anybody's just B2B or B2C anymore. You are B2I - business to individual.","With this emergence of big data and social mobility, you will, in fact, see the death of 'average,' Instead, you will see the era of you.","India will not be at the center - it will be the center of this fourth technology shift.","We share no data with the government anywhere in the world.","Watson augments human decision-making because it isn't governed by human boundaries. It draws together all this information and forms hypotheses, millions of them, and then tests them with all the data it can find. It learns over time what data is reliable, and that's part of its learning process.","Work on something that matters. Have courage.","I was always surrounded by people that wanted to mentor you.","Artificial intelligence is one of 50 things that Watson does. There is also machine learning, text-to-speech, speech-to-text, and different analytical engines - they're like little Lego bricks. You can put intelligence in any product or any process you have.","One day we're going to look back, and whatever this era will get called, it's going to put a premium on math and science.","I think health care is absolutely ripe. It's an $8 trillion industry, lots of inefficiency in it.","Never love something so much that you can't let go of it.","We have started something called the Corporate Services Corps. Now, it was modeled after the Peace Corps from long ago, the 1960s. And the idea was in this modern day and age, how do you get IBM'ers around the world to be global citizens? You know, globally aware, contribute, understand how to work in that environment, but do it on scale.","If you're clear on what you believe, you have a great foundation to go make a market.","And the reason I came to IBM was I think - I always say at a really early age, I learned you've got to be passionate about what you do. No matter what it is, you put too much, your heart and soul in it, you have to be passionate about it. You make too many sacrifices.","So what it means is when you don't believe in the inevitable, it means you don't expect that that's how things have to turn out. You can change them.","To me, I learned along the way, you know, culture is behavior. That's all it is; culture is people's behaviors.","I think, particularly in our tech industry, this is an industry that has violent innovation and then commoditization, and it's a cycle of innovation/commoditization.","I've got a distribution system that goes to 170 countries. If I acquire properly, you know, you may be successful in one or two countries, or one place; I can scale, and that's part of the value that IBM brings.","Every part of your business will change based on what I consider predictive analytics of the future.","As I say to our own team: 'Never protect your past, never define yourself by a single product, and always continue to steward for the long-term. Keep moving towards the future.'","No matter what it is, you put too much, your heart and soul in it, you have to be passionate about it. You make too many sacrifices.","I ask everyone's opinion when they don't speak up. And then when they have an opinion, I'll ask others to talk about it.","It's easy to have an act one and two. Go ahead and have an act three, four, and five. The saying is the easy part. The doing is the hard part.","Don't protect your past. Don't protect your products.","If it's digital, it will be cognitive. If you think that, you're going to change the way you run a business.","What I knew was I liked math and science, and I never wanted to memorize everything. I wanted to understand where it came from.","I'm the kid that tried to take Latin in school because I felt if I could understand the root of everything, then I could understand why it worked. That was what took me into engineering. And the reason I stayed is, engineering teaches you to solve problems. It teaches you to think.","IBM existed a good 50 years before mainframes - we started with scales.","I am very practical.","You need to have a great support around you, people that empathise, understand and yet support, because these CEO jobs are all-consuming.","If you step back and look at technology from every era, it has displaced jobs but also created a lot of jobs.","When my father left us, my mother went back to school immediately. She went to school in the day while we were at school, and she worked at night. She worked very hard to never let someone define her as a victim or a failure.","Ask yourself when you learn the most. I guarantee it's when you felt at risk.","If we would change the basis and align what is taught in school with what is needed with business... that's where I came up with this idea of 'new collar.' Not blue collar or white collar.","One of the most important topics I think for us all to work on is job creation.","The recommendation when I'm mentoring folks, I always tell them - and we talked about this last year - take a risk.","I am big on - even with our whole team - it's always about, well, what were the lessons learned? Something didn't work out? What are the lessons learned? What are the lessons learned?","This idea of 'New Collar' says for the jobs of the future here, there are many in technology that can be done without a four-year college degree and, therefore, 'New Collar' not 'Blue Collar,' 'White Collar.' It's 'New Collar.'","I've always looked for challenges, and I have found plenty.","Some people make their choice on size. I happen to not be a believer in that. I've often said, especially in an industry that's clamoring for growth, if I wanted size, I wouldn't have divested $8 billion of businesses.","Steward for the long term. It's not always easy, but you do it.","When you're on a scale like we are in 170 countries and hundreds of thousands of people, you have a single point of view.","The social network will be the new production line.","I believe that the idea of strategic beliefs may be more important than strategic planning when thinking about how you keep the long view.","Digital, it is not the destination.","This century, the 21st century, will be the Indian century - and I really believe that.","India... what a big part you play in this story for IBM and for the world.","I never look at an acquisition really by size.","Everyone talks about how much data's in the world. Except, actually, 80% of it is pretty blind to computers. I mean, it can store it. But if it's a movie, a poem, a song, it doesn't know what it's actually saying or doing.","Planes don't fly, trains don't run, banks don't operate without much of what IBM does.","It will not be a world of man versus machine. It will be a world of man plus machines.","You will have many more goals in the years ahead. But do not confuse a goal with a purpose.","I have a great job at a great company.","I often sit back and say, 'Be sure about what I believe.'","If you ask me, 'So what is your business model?' Our business model's always about shifting to higher value opportunities.","I'm the ninth CEO of IBM. Every one of my predecessors has steered through a technological shift, and every one left the company in a better position than the person before them and prepared this company with a very strong balance sheet to allow it to continue to invest for the next shift.","There will be times you make decisions that actually detract from growth.","Just because you started your careers in a certain role, let's say hardware engineering, does not mean you'll end your careers in hardware."],"Ginnifer Goodwin":["It took me realizing that a broken heart has never actually killed anyone to find the courage to ask for what I want, in just about every situation. That was part of my own growing up.","Everything goes with short hair. It's bananas.","You know, one of my biggest dreams in life is to play a Disney princess.","But I love being scared. I think you're brave only when you do things that scare you. I've always used fear as a motivator. I'm not sure why.","With the counseling of my family doctor, my mother ended up turning to Weight Watchers and their children's program. I went to weekly meetings, got counseling and would exercise with my peers who were my size. It was the first time I saw a proper children's portion size, and it wasn't two burgers, it was one.","I know now that there are men out there who are, for me, the whole package, who are supportive of my successes because they know I will be just as supportive of theirs. I'm less tolerant of foolishness now; I know that it's important I not tie myself up with the wrong person, because then I will miss the right person coming along.","I'm so an all-or-nothing person in dating, always. I'm big on not wasting time. And so, yeah, if something's not working, it's time to not hold people back.","I think of clothes a lot like costumes. I think of what I wear in real life as being my real life character's costume.","I want to work endlessly and tirelessly until I'm an old, old lady.","Couldn't start the morning without caffeine.","I express myself through clothes, but clothes don't define me.","Halloween is my favorite holiday, and I always go all-out with my costumes.","After spending time with the rescued turkeys at Farm Sanctuary's shelter and seeing how similar they are to my furry companion animals at home, I knew I needed to do everything in my power to protect these friendly and curious birds from the daily pain and suffering they endure on factory farms.","It's like, if you can't focus on a movie for 90 minutes without looking at your phone, then don't go to the movies! You've got some issues, so you should probably stay home and work on those issues, and not distract everyone with lights, and sounds, oh my gosh, the tapping on the screens, it makes me crazy!","I really am super lazy and doing long hair, especially mine, is a big pain in the butt. It's filled with cowlicks and kinks and curls and frizz - and it was taking too much time in the morning.","They say men and women can't be friends, but that's not true.","My day-to-day wardrobe, I do mix it up. I'll wear something from Target along with something by YSL. It's about finding the right items that make you happy.","Unfortunately, as obsessed as I am with all of those Grimm's slash Disney princesses, I do think women have evolved socially in so many ways.","Oh my gosh, I feel like I'm really obsessive about anything dealing with my health.","Oh my gosh, I'd give so much advice to a younger version of myself. I would say it really does get better as you get older. The things that mean so much, the things that seem like, you know, it's going to cause the end of the world, are all things that I've already forgotten.","I cherish all of the times I've fallen on my face and made mistakes, because those experiences have made me who I am.","I'm not nomadic by nature.","I've never had body issues, I've never had an eating disorder. I've never had to go on a diet and that's because of Weight Watchers.","At 9 years old I weighed about 10 lbs. less than what my weight is at 32. I needed to get help.","I see girls who haven't had a carbohydrate in three years. The second you go back to eating right, you're going to put that weight on. You eat one piece of bread and you are screwed, lady!","I perpetuate rumors that I've dated people that I've never actually dated.","I don't know why anyone would want to ask an actor for dating advice. We are not the poster children for healthy relationships.","When I'm doing a film, I love getting together after work with my costars. But we get back to L.A. and I'm like, 'I don't want to go to a club with you, dude. I mean, I think you're rad, and if you want to come play Scrabble with me, that's amazing.'","I'm a better person in a relationship, and I'm a happier person. I need to come home at the end of the day and have it not be about me and my freaking hair and makeup and character motivations anymore. And I think my work is more inspired when home is safe and sound and solid, because what I do for a living is so bananas and so insecure.","I'm insanely girly. I like having the door opened for me. I want to cook dinner for my boyfriend. And I can't wait to have babies.","Nudity is for my boyfriend or my doctor.","Costume designers don't care about trends. They appreciate, above so many other qualities, that tailoring is everything, which is a mantra for the way I dress. Ladies: The most important thing in clothing is to find a good, inexpensive tailor, because clothes at the stores are made for bodies that are anomalies.","I can safely say that other than macaroni and cheese, there's no processed food in my life. There's no inorganic food in my life these days. There's no junk food. There's not a lot of sugar. There's no soy. I mean, really everything that's going into my body is pretty pure.","Growing up in Memphis, I have always admired St. Jude's for the magnificent work they do.","I made some friends at Listerine and they taught me a little bit about oral care. That half of adults suffer from oral disease, that the number one chronic disease among children is oral disease, that we're only taking care of 25% of our mouths when brushing alone and there are more germs in your mouth than there are people on the planet.","A lot of times, I think that what I do for a living has no integrity. 'Once Upon A Time' has changed that to a certain extent because the reaction we get from children out in the world is so fulfilling, I cannot even articulate it. There's nothing like being greeted as Snow White by a hyperventilating child versus Ginnifer Goodwin.","But often times, I feel like I'm so blessed, it's not fair. That what I'm doing is not contributing to the good of the world.","Sometimes I make very selfish choices; like I did 'Once Upon A Time' for my inner 8-year-old and my hypothetical future child. I've done some movies because I would regret them if I didn't, but other projects I've done because they've scared me or if I felt I needed to do a big romantic comedy to help me professionally.","I'm for all the actor's struggle, the self-indulgent, painful journey, but I would rather have fun.","I think most people know inherently that good wins.","I have very curly hair and I straighten it every day - it takes maybe two minutes. I can't imagine anyone having a bigger challenge than I do in the kinkiness that is my crazy 'fro.'","I've always been sort of addicted to genre-jumping. I've never been in the mood to do the same thing I did last time. Hence, me going from 'Big Love' to romantic comedy, to period film... I can't sit still.","I love Valentine's Day! I love it, I love it, I love it. I like having doors opened for me. My favorite romantic comedy is 'When Harry Met Sally.'","I will end up with someone in the arts. I am positive. I eat, breathe and sleep acting. And I'll end up with someone who is happy staying at home and having me cook supper. But I also really need to be intellectually challenged and stimulated. I want someone bookish, and someone who is passionate.","I hardly ever work out.","I'm a Southern lady that almost never leaves the house without makeup on.","I would point out that I'm an actress for a reason! If I were popular in high school, I would have considered another career because I wouldn't have been alone in my room, making up other characters for myself. I definitely had growing pains. The popular kids didn't want anything to do with the girl who was starting the drama club.","Romcoms are challenging, but I'm hungry for drama.","I only wear heels when a stylist puts me in them.","I started reading and learned that we don't need any of it - meat, dairy products. We get everything we need without those things - except maybe B12, but there's this whole controversy that maybe we're only getting B12 because the animals are being fed B12 supplements.","There's nothing I want less than a piece of cheese or a burger. I have nightmares I'm being force-fed these things. I have no interest in converting anyone. It's purely how I want to live my life. I don't judge anyone.","I come from theater, and doing period stuff is so whimsical and imaginative and so outside any frame of reference than I have ever had so I prefer that just in terms of fun factor.","I understand why society, especially American society, is gravitating toward fairy tales, given our economy. We've been exploring the world of witches and wizards for years. We've been exploring the world of vampires for years. Clearly the public - I mean, I feel like all of this was ushered in by 'Harry Potter' - in my own fannish beliefs.","Oh, my, yes. I was raised in this Southern culture where if a guy was sarcastic, that just meant he didn't know how to show his love - but secretly he cared! I completely bought that. The men I chased and the things I put up with - it was criminal.","One night I'd had some beers, and then I Googled myself and spent the night in tears.","Why do only boys get to chase? Nuh-uh! If anything, I think this whole sitting back and waiting thing can be self-sabotaging. We have to send up flares. We have to let guys know we're open for business.","People always say a script will be 'brought to life in a magical way,' but for me that has been proven wrong time and time again.","I am much more open to plural marriage than I was before, and I now support it in certain situations. I do believe it is right for some people. But our example in America today is gross abuse - I can't support it in fundamentalist compounds.","In real life, people don't try to live dramatically, people try to live in a light way. People try to laugh.","As long as I can wear a wig I can be any character, and in real life I can be myself.","The costumes are insane on 'Once Upon a Time.' It did influence my taking the job, the fact that not only would I be horseback riding and sword fighting and traipsing through the woods but I would be doing all those things in insane, medieval garb."],"Ginny Brown-Waite":["Let us face it, the U.N. has failed. It has failed in its mission to promote world peace.","For centuries, the world has heard the oppressed, the downtrodden and the vulnerable cry out for their freedoms, for their rights and for a chance to emerge from the shadows of the tyranny and bloodshed that they had lived with.","No longer should women be denied the right to vote, no longer should women be treated as second class citizens, no longer should women not be allowed to be a citizen at all.","American government was founded on a belief and a faith in God and in doing what is right and just.","First, women are more likely to live in poverty during their retirement years than are men.","The United Nations has come under the control of outlaw nations and self-serving special interest groups.","Under the current pay-as-you-go Social Security system, not one person is actually guaranteed benefits.","The world today is changing rapidly, and we are helping to make it better for our children's future.","Since President Bush took office in 2001, this Congress has supported an agenda of democracy, freedom and expansion of rights for all peoples throughout the world.","The list of non-democratic regimes that have seen significant reforms since 2001 is long and significant.","While all of these are important and significant events, it is the United States' foreign policy that furthers the advancement of freedoms and rights for women that is the most striking for me.","We all know that, unfortunately, the media does not always portray the good things that are happening in Iraq and Afghanistan, and this will be a great opportunity for us to glean some information from the Iraqi women who are here for us to also take back to our constituents.","As is the case with many Middle Eastern nations, women are nowhere near equal to men when it comes to basic freedoms and rights that we take for granted every day.","While Kuwait is not a democracy, giving only half the population a voice in their government is not a policy this Congress should support and one that I am glad that Kuwait's leaders are changing.","When given the chance, women have proven they will participate in the electoral process.","Allowing Texas to display the Ten Commandments on State property but disallowing Kentucky courthouses from doing the same is a poor and flawed interpretation of the U.S. Constitution.","Social Security is a plan that actually was designed in a much different time, in a different era, and with a different set of American demographics in mind.","I have the highest number of Social Security recipients of any Member of Congress, and it is always good to hear about how women in their districts are affected by any changes, by the need for changes in Social Security.","If a woman did not work and have the opportunity to save and invest on her own throughout her lifetime, she is often totally reliant on her family and Social Security for her retirement years.","In fact, Social Security is the only source of income nationwide for 29 percent of unmarried elderly women.","While women certainly have made great strides toward pay parity in the past 30 years, there is still a gap in earnings between men and women in equivalent professions.","The women who pass away before they receive Social Security, for them this is nothing but a tax from which they or their family will never receive a benefit.","On the other end of the spectrum, these women who do live long enough to collect Social Security face the challenge of being disproportionately dependent on the Social Security system for retirement income.","The United Nations is a mess, riddled with scandals. In fact, the U.N. itself is a scandal.","The United Nations' greatest fear is that average Americans will no longer tolerate these international scandals and demand that America withdraw from the international organization.","No issue is more important to this Congress than securing our borders and protecting our homeland, and I guarantee it is very important to our constituents.","Through the harsh design of fate, Florida was dealt the unfortunate circumstances of bearing the brunt of not one but two hurricanes, and it appears more dark clouds are poised to visit the Sunshine State.","I have noticed a marked improvement in FEMA and with the coordination of FEMA and the State agencies.","Part of the redesign of FEMA is that they have so many people on standby, whether it is a retired nurse or a doctor who will take time off to go exactly where they are needed.","The newer homes did not sustain as much damage because they were built to better safety codes; they were better designed, higher wind loads for the roof. All of those facets made those homes sustain the storm a whole lot better."],"Gio Gonzalez":["To be a small town kid from Hialeah, Fla., pitching in Miami and representing Team U.S.A., that says it all. It's a kid's dream. Don't pinch me. I don't want to wake up.","I remember my rookie hazing. It wasn't fun.","I remember when I started off, my first car was a Kia Spectra. With a spoiler kit and some rims.","I'm definitely not a 'Fast and a Furious' guy.","At 19, I was still figuring out how to throw a fastball.","I couldn't throw a knuckleball if my life depended on it.","I'm Cuban-American, everybody says. I have a Cuban background, Cuban blood.","It's an honor to represent a Latin culture."],"Gioachino Rossini":["Give me a laundry-list and I'll set it to music.","Every kind of music is good, except the boring kind.","Mr. Wagner has beautiful moments but bad quarters of an hour.","Wagner has lovely moments but awful quarters of an hour.","One can't judge Wagner's opera Lohengrin after a first hearing, and I certainly don't intend to hear it a second time.","Wagner is a composer who has beautiful moments but awful quarter hours."],"Gioconda Belli":["There is nothing quixotic or romantic in wanting to change the world. It is possible. It is the age-old vocation of all humanity.","Sexuality surrounds us like a dangerous aura. The same reverence that is given to the spirit is not given to the flesh. We have had a sexual revolution, but the sexual revolution only has made sex more pervasive. It hasn't granted the level of reverence and respect that it should have.","I never thought that sex was wrong, sinful, dirty. When you take away the thought of things being dirty or forbidden, then you can really enjoy your sensuality.","Poetry for me is very easy. It's like a lightning bolt. I feel this calling, and the first line of the poem comes into my head, and I just have to go to the page, to the typewriter, to the computer or whatever and write it.","There is a biological power that is intrinsic to the woman, to the female condition. Because you are able to give life. You are the reproducer of the species. Men feel very weak in front of a woman because a woman is capable of eliciting a number of instincts in a man. And that is what has made men very nervous about women.","Books have the power to be the light we are seeking at crucial moments in our lives. Reading helps us realize we are not alone, that we can change our circumstances and even achieve the impossible.","I grew up in a very difficult country, a very oppressive situation because of the Somoza dictatorship. My family was in opposition to Somoza; Somoza was a liberal, and my family were conservatives. These were the two traditional parties in Nicaragua.","The world has always gone forward when people have dared to have crazy ideas.","I am convinced that the reason why my kids have become very fulfilled and achieving human beings is because I wasn't raising them alone.","My son lives in Nicaragua. My daughters live in the United States.","There are not many intellectuals left of Harold Pinter's stature who dare raise their voices - and with such force - against the menace of U.S. and the unrestricted use of its power. Pinter's voice is an unceasing thunder.","Novels give you the opportunity to create a whole world. Because you create people, you make them talk... You decide who they are, whether they live or die. It's the closest thing to feeling like a god that you can come to.","We have built our identities in many respects based on the guilt-ridden stories we have been told about our creation. For women, it is a very damning knowledge to be portrayed as curious and careless seductresses.","It had never crossed my mind that a man could think he had the right to stop me from being who I was.","I had a very good sexual education. My mother was very advanced in that regard. She conveyed to me the sense of reverence and wonder about my body and the powers of my sexuality not only to give life, but also to be a whole person and to enjoy pleasure. It was put to me as an almost holy act.","Never was my political stance determined by the men I was with. I had my own ideas."],"Giordano Bruno":["It is proof of a base and low mind for one to wish to think with the masses or majority, merely because the majority is the majority. Truth does not change because it is, or is not, believed by a majority of the people.","Every soul and spirit has some degree of continuity with the universal spirit, which is recognized to be located not only where the individual soul lives and perceives, but also to be spread out everywhere in its essence and substance, as many Platonists and Pythagoreans have taught.","With luck on your side, you can do without brains.","Do you not see what damage has been done to science through this: i.e. pedants wishing to be philosophers; to treat of natural things, and mix themselves with and decide about things Divine?","I consider that all which lives must feed itself and nourish itself in a manner suitable to the way in which it lives.","Divine love does not weigh down, nor carry his servant captive and enslaved to the lowest depths, but raises him, supports him and magnifies him above all liberty whatsoever.","The intellectual power is never at rest; it is never satisfied with any comprehended truth, but ever proceeds on and on towards that truth which is not comprehended. So also the will, which follows the apprehension; we see that it is never satisfied with anything finite.","Nothing is so good that impious and sacrilegious and wicked people cannot contort its proper benefit into evil.","What can be more stupid than to be in pain about future things and absent ones which at present are not felt?","Innumerable spirits and souls, when spread out through the same space, do not interfere with each other such that the diffusion of one would affect the diffusion of an infinity of others.","There is one simple Divinity found in all things, one fecund Nature, preserving mother of the universe insofar as she diversely communicates herself, casts her light into diverse subjects, and assumes various names.","The soul, in its power, is present in some way in the entire universe, because it apprehends substances which are not included in the body in which it lives, although they are related to it.","It may be you fear more to deliver judgment upon me than I fear judgment.","The whole soul is in the whole body, in the bones and in the veins and in the heart; it is no more present in one part than in another, and it is no less present in one part than in the whole, nor in the whole less than in one part.","There is a descent from God through the world to animals, and an ascent from animals through the world to God. He is the highest point of the scale, pure act and active power, the purest light.","We see that pedantry has never been held in such esteem for the government of the world as in our times, and it offers as many paths of the true intelligible species and objects of infallible and sole truth as there are individual pedants.","That which we have lived is nothing; that which we live is a point; that which we have to live is not yet a point, but may be a point which, together, shall be and shall have been.","Although one soul lives in the whole body, and all the body's members are controlled by one soul, still the whole body and the whole soul and the parts of the universe are vivified by a certain total spirit.","See how fortune deludes us, and that which we put carefully into her hands, she either breaks or lets it fall from her hands, or causes it to be removed by the violence of another, or suffocates and poisons, or taints with suspicion, fear and jealousy to the great hurt and ruin of the possessor.","It is proper that noble spirits, equipped with truth and enlightened with the Divine intelligence, should arm themselves against dense ignorance by climbing up to the high rock and tower of contemplation.","Time is the father of truth, its mother is our mind.","There is no law governing all things.","Just as Divinity descends in a certain manner, to the extent that one communicates with Nature, so one ascends to Divinity through Nature, just as by means of a life resplendent in natural things one rises to the life that presides over them.","Beautiful sights arouse feelings of love, and contrary sights bring feelings of disgrace and hate. And the emotions of the soul and spirit bring something additional to the body itself, which exists under the control of the soul and the direction of the spirit.","Time takes all and gives all.","The soul of the world is in the whole world, and is everywhere so adapted to matter that, at each place, it produces the proper subject and causes the proper actions.","Because of the active principle and spirit or universal soul, nothing is so incomplete, defective or imperfect, or, according to common opinion, so completely insignificant that it could not become the source of great events.","To the perfect, if it be perfect, there is nothing that can be added; therefore, the will is not capable of any other desire, when that which is of the perfect is present with it, highest and best."],"Giorgio Agamben":["The thought of security bears within it an essential risk. A state which has security as its sole task and source of legitimacy is a fragile organism; it can always be provoked by terrorism to become more terroristic.","Those who are truly contemporary are those who neither perfectly coincide with their time nor adapt to its demands... Contemporariness, then, is that relationship with time that adheres to it through a disconnection."],"Giorgio Armani":["To create something exceptional, your mindset must be relentlessly focused on the smallest detail.","The difference between style and fashion is quality.","I don't have a formula to pass on. I always did it my own way. Even today, I hold my independence close. It's what's most precious to me. Passion. Risk. Tenacity. Consistency. This is my professional history.","Jeans represent democracy in fashion.","I dress in my 'uniform,' or my own dress code, which reflects my personal method and work ethic. My belief is that my plain T-shirt - I have about 40 of them - or blue sweater helps focus others' attention on me and on what I say.","I've always thought of the T-shirt as the Alpha and Omega of the fashion alphabet.","I'm a very private person, and perhaps this can be mistaken for aloofness.","Milan is a true metropolis: strong and fearless but welcoming, too. Little by little, I came to realize that I could become someone here.","The more successful I become, the more I want to remain like me, with my defects and insecurities.","I would say that my idea of style and my taste are the same as when I began: They express my deep appreciation of all that is simple and linear... I always want to keep up with the times but without altering the essential characteristics of my philosophy.","The essence of style is a simple way of saying something complex.","A well-maintained physique is a great business card. Ideas and intelligence are what matters, but if you have a well-maintained physique, it's better.","Why do I put myself in a position to be cast aside or not considered as I would like to? Because I am a creative mind, because I still aspire to be one.","I am not in the stock market. I am beholden to no one in what I do. If I spend billions on a fashion show, I spend billions. It's not public. And if I am in the stock market, I am obligated to account for things, and to show what the business is doing.","I prefer being around young people. I don't like situations from the past, definitely no nostalgia. I prefer to think of doing everything new with a different generation that has a different mentality.","Anyone who is passionate about what they do will have a better chance of connecting with future generations than those who simply follow transient trends. At least their work will have a distinctive character, and this is what people respond to, I believe.","I don't like women who follow fashion in the sense of becoming victims of it. I like women who have elegance, who have allure, who use fashion, rather than the other way around.","During a fashion show, I want the clothes to speak. The effort I put into my work must be respected.","Never in my wildest dreams did I entertain the idea that I would become a fashion designer.","This is very much my philosophy as a fashion designer. I have never believed in design for design's sake. For me, the most important thing is that people actually wear my clothes. I do not design for the catwalk or for magazine shoots - I design for customers.","It's not a good idea to match your shoes with a bag too stringently. Go for subtle similarity.","Creative work gives you an almost indissoluble connection with people.","Marketing is not a nice word, but the world is about marketing now.","I learned little by little. I learned how to draw. I learned how to tell the difference in the quality of fabrics - the subtle differences. I started with collections for men. So my first collection for women was deeply inspired by male roles.","I started to take care of my body after I turned 50. I never liked how I looked physically because I was too cute, short, with coloring only on my cheeks, the perfect little nose, and then the blue eyes. I was a hit with girls, who told me it was like I was in Technicolor.","That is always what I've had to do in life: to show I am capable of surviving.","My work today is perceived as being classic, but when I first started out, it was a break from the norm. Since then, I have continued to reinvent myself. I don't change my style, but I allow it to evolve.","These days, as I am older and wiser, I realize that there is a danger in becoming an icon, as people can see you as remote and untouchable, and they are less willing to tolerate you doing things that don't fit with their preconceived idea of you.","When I started, I had nothing. Because my family was really, really, really poor.","I didn't have a happy childhood.","You have to have doubts. I have collaborators I work with. I listen, and then I decide. That's how it works.","My relationship with Paris began when I was working for Cerruti in the mid-1960s. When there was an important event in his store, Nino Cerruti very kindly took me with him. I was fascinated, and the city made a big impression on me.","I must always try to do better because perfectionism, and the need to always have new goals and achieve them, is a state of mind that brings profound meaning to life.","I design for real people. I think of our customers all the time. There is no virtue whatsoever in creating clothing or accessories that are not practical.","I was an observer. I liked to listen rather than openly express myself. This trait is something that I've retained over the years.","There are so many things to take into account - your ambition, your ego, the press, the consumers. You can never be sure that you'll be on top of the pile again.","There are always protests, whether you do something good or bad. Even if you do something beneficial, people say you do it because it's advertising.","I love things that age well - things that don't date, that stand the test of time and that become living examples of the absolute best.","I believe that my clothes can give people a better image of themselves - that it can increase their feelings of confidence and happiness.","You can think you've made it and yet the next day's press will always be waiting for you, the public will always ask more of you. In short, you can always do better!","Actually I am very glad that people can buy Armani - even if it's a fake. I like the fact that I'm so popular around the world.","In practice, I've had a presence in China since 1998 with my commercial spaces and shops.","China approaches fashion with strong enthusiasm. And I believe that this enthusiasm can be translated into something interesting, economically speaking. Not only for my brand, but also for other brands.","It is difficult to talk about fashion in the abstract, without a human body before my eyes, without drawings, without a choice of fabric - without a practical or visual reality.","War taught me that not everything is glamorous.","I wanted to dress the woman who lives and works, not the woman in a painting.","In the fashion world, you have to make clothes to sell. You have to make clothes for the press. You have to make clothes for yourself. What I mean is, everything is an obligation. But a writer? A pure artist? Maybe he doesn't make one lira - but he does what he wants.","I am happiest in public, working in my world. Then I can be the star. That I can do. When I am not working, I am more guarded, set apart. It's not my life, that. I like interactions, but interaction that is not forced.","I have never had anything to do with the kind of fashion that is influenced by the press or identified with the spirit of the season. My clients come for me; they come back each season for my spirit. That's the reality.","This is the problem with the world today: Nobody wants to take risks, to risk being themselves.","There can be nothing without love. No money, no power. Love is very important. When you wake up in the morning, you need to know that somebody else is waking up, thinking of you.","My well-known aesthetic sense, which is so obvious and personal, spontaneously spurs me to challenge myself with different disciplines.","If I eat at the Emporio Armani Caffe, my favorite thing to order is risotto or pasta with tomato sauce in winter; in summer, I prefer a Caprese salad, Parmigiano cheese flakes, or some truly fresh ricotta cheese.","The excitement does not change. After 40 years in the business, I still find the show to be a magical moment - the performance anxiety, the litmus test.","I must make decisions every five minutes and give the impression of being sure of myself! Sincerely, this is the cause of my verbal violence.","Without insecurities, I think one becomes a little bit of an idiot.","I get really frustrated when people say that a collection is not very 'Armani.' Iconic status can be like a pair of handcuffs, especially if, like me, you wish to continually stretch yourself creatively, as Warhol did.","I have always considered that my collection must have an international flair so it can be at the service of the European public. Or to people in Asia. Yes, there are tiny little alterations I notice in the proportions of the outfits, but fundamentally, the collection is that way.","My work has taught me to pay great respects towards human beings.","The idea of the museum is to show my work since the start, and I wanted to show all of it, not just to choose between different pieces. They are grouped together in themes - minimalism, androgyny, black and white, graphic, flowers, and so on - from the earliest designs to the most recent ones.","A homosexual man is a man 100 per cent. He does not need to dress homosexual.","I prefer to look at a natural woman. A woman should be courageous to become older, not desperate to look younger than her age.","When I started Giorgio Armani in the mid-'70s, I realized that women needed a way to dress that was equivalent to that of men - something that would give them dignity, an attitude that would help them handle their work life.","These designers have no reserve. They've chosen a path and thrown themselves onto it head first, regardless of everything. Whether or not their designs are sellable or vulgar. As long as it's new and people talk about it. That is the truth."],"Giorgio Morandi":["Everything is a mystery, ourselves, and all things both simple and humble.","A half dozen pictures would just about be enough for the life of an artist, for my life."],"Giorgio Moroder":["Now, the DJ becomes a star in itself because of the way he programs the songs with lows and then highs and then slowing it down. The big DJs, like Tiesto and Deadmau5 and all those guys, they are very, very creative.","Once you free your mind about a concept of music and harmony being correct, you can do whatever you want.","Even when disco went out, I could still make hits. Once I had so much success, every idea became concentrated. I had so much confidence. I knew how the bass should sound, what rhythms would work. The tempos I knew: 110 to 120 BPM. I knew they would dance in the clubs in New York or anywhere.","Disco is music for dancing, and people will always want to dance.","Dance music doesn't care where you live. It doesn't care who your friends are. It doesn't care how much money you make. It doesn't care if you're 74 or if you are 24 because... 74 is the new 24!","I wanted to get into art. I did some neon stuff. I worked in, not computer-generated, but computer manipulation of pictures.","My music was typically continental - nothing like, say, The Beatles.","I don't think there is too much art involved in what I do.","I am reluctant to judge things without being informed.","I am certainly not racist; I even like the British.","In film, I was surprised when I first saw the movie 'Drive.' I said, 'Oh, God. It sounds great - I love it. Wow, this could be the soundtrack from 'American Gigolo' or 'Cat People.' But I'm surprised that the director would agree with a composer to write that kind of sound.","The disco sound, you must see, is not art or anything so serious.","In pop or rock you can make a fast song or a slow one, but in disco there is really just the one rhythm.","I am much more happy doing what I know I can do than what I am not sure I could do.","Phil Ramone is very special. Barbra Streisand or Diana Ross... they are the best.","Nowadays you need so much money to be able to launch a new artist, notably in America; you would hardly believe the sums involved.","It is at least 10 times more difficult to get a good synthesiser sound than on an acoustic instrument.","In both pop and disco, the meaning of the lyrics is not too important. I have nothing I feel I particularly want to say.","I would not be happy to do what I do unless I felt that the large audience wanted it.","I think it would be stupid for us to try and tell people who are dancing in a discotheque about the problems of the world. That is the very thing they have come away to avoid.","I have to admit, I do not listen to much rock music.","I am not so complicated or intelligent a composer, nor am I very interested in becoming so. I am much more happy doing what I know I can do than what I am not sure I could do.","I achieved something specially different with Love To Love You Baby and I Feel Love. These songs will endure.","Every business is there to make money, and making a record is business. This tends to be forgotten by many.","Disco does work better with black artists or players. They just feel it more.","I listen to the group Disclosure; they have great sounds. Maybe not as adventurous as Skrillex. I think the key thing is to have those beautiful sounds... the amazing sounds of Skrillex are almost phenomenal.","I love Lady Gaga, Rihanna - all the pop girls like Katy Perry. I think Miley Cyrus is very talented, too. Apart from the visuals, which you may like or not like, but her music is quite good, actually. 'Wrecking Ball' is quite a good song, and she sang it really nicely.","I like the sounds of EDM; the guys create new sounds, beautiful sounds. The melodies, it's a little less. I like the kind of melodies I did with Donna Summer, or 'Flashdance,' where you have a verse, a chorus - a song setup.","When I'm dead, somebody can write my biography. I wrote a national hymn, an anthem, which I don't want to present to that country. But I have a deal with my wife - when I'm dead, she should offer it, because then I'm safe.","My favorite would be 'Love to Love You' because from zero, I went to Number One. I don't think it's the best song - the best one is probably between 'Flashdance' and 'Take My Breath Away.'","'Take My Breath Away' had that interesting bass line, which I hear quite often. It had that terrible change of key, which Terri Nunn hated, but I loved.","I had an idea for a technologically advanced luxury watch. I got involved in digital art and neon painting and put on shows of my work.","I designed a sports car, the Cizeta-Moroder, with Marcello Gandini from Lamborghini; he did the Countach, of course. The Cizeta cost $600,000, but we could bargain - if a Japanese businessman says he wants it for three, fine.","I set a Google Alert for myself, and now I'm seeing people say my music influenced them and how great it is all the time. Sometimes I listen to this stuff that's supposed to be influenced by me, and I can't hear myself in it. But I'd rather they say it than not.","I was in Studio 54 one time; it was great. But I'm not a discotheque guy. Sometimes, if I had a new demo, I went to some discotheques to check it out - see how the reactions of the people were. But just to dance, I rarely did that.","That big hit 'Get Lucky' is a disco song - not only the melody and the whole concept, but we had one of the great disco guys and one of the best guitarists ever, Nile Rodgers, to play on it. So that's great disco, but a modern disco, because it has great vocoders and synthesizers.","One day. I was putting on a hill in Zurich, and a few hundred yards away, Diana Ross was doing a sound test at an arena for a performance that night of 'Take My Breath Away,' my song with her. That was a very nice game, an incredible feeling.","In the early '80s, my sound - especially that mysterious kind of synthesized sound that was used so much - every relatively cheap TV show eventually had it because it's not expensive. It's just one guy doing the whole soundtrack. So it was overdone.","One of the most interesting things, at least for me, are the soundtracks for 'The Social Network' and 'Drive.' Basically, it's what I did in 'American Gigolo.' I could have done the music for those movies blindfolded. And one of them won an Oscar, and the other is this massive soundtrack.","A producer is always behind the scenes, even more in the movies - nobody sees you. I didn't even meet most of the actors. When I worked on 'Top Gun,' I never met Tom Cruise. You were always in the background.","Unless you use the vocoder the way Daft Punk use it, it is very limited. When they sing it's almost human. It sounds sexy. I just used it as an effect. It wasn't because I was not able to sing; I'm not a great singer, but I had some hits as a singer, too. It's a nice effect.","I had an album out at exactly the same time as 'Love to Love You' called 'Einzelganger,' and it's great, all electronic. I'm using a vocoder, doing all this cut-up stuff on there, but no one knows about it.","I was involved with a sports car called Cizeta-Moroder, which was the first 16-cylinder car, beautiful. I think we sold about eight cars, and then in '92 the economic crash came, and we had to close the shop."],"Giorgio Napolitano":["Now is the time to show maximum responsibility. It is not the time to pay off old scores nor for sterile partisan recriminations. It is time to re-establish a climate of calmness and mutual respect.","We have to continue our efforts with determination.","Speaking from my experience as a person involved for a long time in building the European Union, it is important to have patience and efforts to build a community of nations.","We owe it to our children to give them a dignified and hopeful future.","It takes a lot of effort to win back credibility after having lost it so heavily.","The country will also need 'new forms of social welfare' instead of its current system which is excessively centred on pensions.","If the constitutional process is not brought to a successful conclusion before the European elections, then the whole process might run out of steam.","It is a responsibility we perceive from the entire international community to protect the stability of the single currency as well as the European frame work.","No one, no social group, can today avoid the commitment to contribute to the clean up of public finances in order to prevent the financial collapse of Italy. The sacrifices will not be in vain, especially if the economy begins to grow again.","The principal of unity and indivisibility of the republic are the essential reference points.","This unprecedented crisis, which is without doubt the worst since the second world war, is not over.","We must resist the temptation of once again turning America into the traditional bogeyman of the left.","The institutions of the European Union, and the states that belong to this union, each and every one, are paying the price of our failures, hesitations and contradictions. We should each ask ourselves how personally responsible we are.","It's not just we Italians who are caught up in the difficulty.","No part of Italian society should see itself as exempt from the effort to save Italy from collapse."],"Giorgio Vasari":["In our own time it has been seen... that simple children, roughly brought up in the wilderness, have begun to draw by themselves, impelled by their own natural genius, instructed solely by the example of these beautiful paintings and sculptures of Nature.","Men of genius sometimes accomplish most when they work the least, for they are thinking out inventions and forming in their minds the perfect idea that they subsequently express with their hands.","These rough sketches, which are born in an instant in the heat of inspiration, express the idea of their author in a few strokes, while on the other hand too much effort and diligence sometimes saps the vitality and powers of those who never know when to leave off.","Art owes its origin to Nature herself... this beautiful creation, the world, supplied the first model, while the original teacher was that divine intelligence which has not only made us superior to the other animals, but like God Himself, if I may venture to say it."],"Giorgio de Chirico":["To become truly immortal, a work of art must escape all human limits: logic and common sense will only interfere. But once these barriers are broken, it will enter the realms of childhood visions and dreams.","Art is the fatal net which catches these strange moments on the wing like mysterious butterflies, fleeing the innocence and distraction of common men.","Although the dream is a very strange phenomenon and an inexplicable mystery, far more inexplicable is the mystery and aspect our minds confer on certain objects and aspects of life.","I believe, however, that such abnormal moments can be found in everyone, and it is all the more fortunate when they occur in individuals with creative talent or with clairvoyant powers."],"Giorgos Seferis":["Every man of action has a strong dose of egoism, pride, hardness, and cunning. But all those things will be regarded as high qualities if he can make them the means to achieve great ends.","For poetry there exists neither large countries nor small. Its domain is in the heart of all men.","Don't ask who's influenced me. A lion is made up of the lambs he's digested, and I've been reading all my life.","I think the Swedish Academy wished to manifest its solidarity with the living spirit of Greece today.","How can you dare teach a man to read until you've taught him everything else first?"],"Giotto di Bondone":["Rome is the city of echoes, the city of illusions, and the city of yearning.","The sincere friends of this world are as ship lights in the stormiest of nights.","Every painting is a voyage into a sacred harbour.","The human heart is as a frail craft on which we wish to reach the stars.","Take pleasure in your dreams; relish your principles and drape your purest feelings on the heart of a precious lover."],"Giovanni Agnelli":["And the Marshall Plan, to us, meant a general who had turned into a secretary of state, and that the secretary of state saw the necessity of the reconstruction of these European countries that had suffered so heavily.","In the immediate postwar years, the whole of Europe was in a recession. So first of all, it helped us step out of a recession; it gave a certain amount of speed to the economy. But that was the first step.","The Communists at that moment were very strong in Italy, and the Italian Communist Party was the biggest Communist Party outside the Soviet Union.","I believe that we were very, very lucky that it went that way.","Well, in 1947... in Europe and in Italy especially, we thought of America as all-powerful."],"Giovanni Boccaccio":["While farmers generally allow one rooster for ten hens, ten men are scarcely sufficient to service one woman.","People tend to believe the bad rather than the good.","Heaven would indeed be heaven if lovers were there permitted as much enjoyment as they had experienced on earth.","Do as we say, and not as we do.","Human it is to have compassion on the unhappy."],"Giovanni Falcone":["He who doesn't fear death dies only once."],"Giovanni Guareschi":["When you share your last crust of bread with a beggar, you mustn't behave as if you were throwing a bone to a dog. You must give humbly, and thank him for allowing you to have a part in his hunger.","It is right to hate sin, but not to hate the sinner."],"Giovanni Papini":["Humans: become atheists each and all! God will nevertheless welcome you with all his heart!","There are those who have a desire to love, but do not have the capacity to love."],"Giovanni Pico della Mirandola":["Whatever seeds each man cultivates will grow to maturity and bear in him their own fruit. If they be vegetative, he will be like a plant.","Spiritual beings, either from the beginning or soon thereafter, become what they are to be for ever and ever.","It was not the part of His kindly love that he who was to praise God's divine generosity in regard to others should be compelled to condemn it in regard to himself.","But in its final creation it was not the part of the Father's power to fail as though exhausted. It was not the part of His wisdom to waver in a needful matter through poverty of counsel.","And if, happy in the lot of no created thing, he withdraws into the center of his own unity, his spirit, made one with God, in the solitary darkness of God, who is set above all things, shall surpass them all.","If you see a philosopher determining all things by means of right reason, him you shall reverence: he is a heavenly being and not of this earth.","God the Father, the supreme Architect, had already built this cosmic home we behold, the most sacred temple of His godhead, by the laws of His mysterious wisdom.","Admittedly great though these reasons be, they are not the principal grounds, that is, those which may rightfully claim for themselves the privilege of the highest admiration.","For why should we not admire more the angels themselves and the blessed choirs of heaven?","On man when he came into life the Father conferred the seeds of all kinds and the germs of every way of life.","But, when the work was finished, the Craftsman kept wishing that there were someone to ponder the plan of so great a work, to love its beauty, and to wonder at its vastness.","At last the best of artisans ordained that that creature to whom He had been able to give nothing proper to himself should have joint possession of whatever had been peculiar to each of the different kinds of being.","The Pythagoreans degrade impious men into brutes and, if one is to believe Empedocles, even into plants."],"Giovanni Ribisi":["I'm old fashioned with my cell phone. I like that human contact and I think it's important.","You have to take into account it was the cell phone that became what the modern-day concept of a phone call is, and this is a device that's attached to your hip 24/7. Before that there was 'leave a message' and before that there was 'hopefully you're home.'","I love talking about Scientology.","There's the concept that if I do this big budget project, then that will help me do the things I really want to do and bring more money to those films.","My mother told me I was begging her to be an actor when I was four. My father and my grandfather saw at least one or two movies a week; they were film buffs, so I guess it just rubbed off on me. And now it's kind of become a way of life for me.","Those people are unabashedly ruthless as far as money is concerned.","We went to - I guess it was a legitimate boiler room, and I sat in front of this guy who literally was on the phone with two people at once. They call it double fisting.","I'm so critical of myself. I'm actually really, really proud of the film. It's really cool to see a movie at Sundance because everybody is so supportive.","What's sad is that there is an addictive quality to that, to believing your own hype; to allowing yourself to become validated by others and no longer by yourself. That's the danger of celebrity.","I've been allowed to grow over the past twenty years. I've managed to avoid being trapped in one moment of my career and for that, I'm very thankful.","If I had to choose criteria, for me, it's about first the director. I want to be a part of something that's good and intellectually challenging. After the director it's the character and the story. That's the deal for me.","Dostoevski was on to something. You are the path you choose. You are what your vocation is.","I used to shy away from publicity so as not to let it get in the way of the work. But it's part of the job. The tabloids are a whole other arena. If fame happens, it happens. I just want to maintain focus.","I grew up with Scientology - my parents at one point were clerical. It's a pragmatic philosophy, not merely a belief system. Yeah, it's had media exposure because certain luminaries do Scientology, but millions of people do it who are not celebrities. It's not a threat or some cult.","I just consider myself a committed actor. If a movie is a success, that's great; I'm happy for that. But I've learned just to concentrate on my job and do the best that I can.","My mother told me I was begging her to be an actor when I was four. My father and my grandfather saw at least one or two movies a week; they were film buffs, so I guess it just rubbed off on me.","For me, acting is all about the aesthetic. I just want to keep honing my craft. Not that I'm taking myself too seriously, but every artist should consider himself Picasso. Otherwise, you're doing yourself an injustice.","I'm really happy with where I am, the movies in my life. Not satisfied, necessarily. But I won't put it on somebody else, blame anybody else for my position in the business. It's the choices I have made.","I want to be a part of something that's good and intellectually challenging.","I could almost say it is my religion. I guess that sounds pretentious, but I want to live and breathe cinema.","It was extremely useful to grow up in front of the camera. It gives the camera no significance. I think it helped me have perspective on things. The attraction that Hollywood can have, I feel like I'm over that. Instead I just concentrate on acting.","I was on 'Junior Star Search' when I was 10 years old, in the acting category. The adult version of 'Star Search' didn't have an acting category, but for the kids, they had an acting category. It was the strangest thing. It was full blown 1980s, with big hair, mullets, and the whole deal.","I'm definitely not the same actor that I was when I was 9 years old, and that's because my intentions, my goals, aspirations, or whatever were different.","I grew up in the '70s and in Los Angeles during the new blockbuster era. 'Star Wars' was the first film that I saw in the movie theater. I wanted to be an actor; then it turned out to be this 'Wizard of Oz' story: I was 10 or 11 years old, and it turned into something that I didn't think it was.","Nicolas Cage is such a phenomenal actor. I've been a fan of his forever. I can't tell you how many times I've seen 'Moonstruck' and 'Wild At Heart.'","James Cameron has always been one of my favorite filmmakers. The first 'Terminator' is such a phenomenal film. It's not just that, though - he's also a very interesting person, James Cameron. It's fascinating to talk to him about science and engineering.","I always wanted to go to Cuba growing up. It was this fascinating, forbidden country that seemed to have a lot of politics and folklore and history behind it.","It's an interesting thing to come to New York and do a television show. You're doing 10 hours of content in four and a half months. Eighty-hour weeks are par for the course."],"Giraldus Cambrensis":["Since, therefore, no man is born without faults, and he is esteemed the best whose errors are the least, let the wise man consider everything human as connected with himself; for in worldly affairs there is no perfect happiness under heaven.","Not addicted to gluttony or drunkenness, this people who incur no expense in food or dress, and whose minds are always bent upon the defence of their country, and on the means of plunder, are wholly employed in the care of their horses and furniture.","It is remarkable that this people, though unarmed, dares attack an armed foe; the infantry defy the cavalry, and by their activity and courage generally prove victors.","No one of this nation ever begs, for the houses of all are common to all; and they consider liberality and hospitality amongst the first virtues.","Evil borders upon good, and vices are confounded with virtues; as the report of good qualities is delightful to a well-disposed mind, so the relation of the contrary should not be offensive.","From these inconsiderable attempts, some idea may be formed with what success, should Fortune afford an opportunity, I am likely to treat matters of greater importance.","Happy and fortunate indeed would this nation be, nay, completely blessed, if it had good prelates and pastors, and but one prince, and that prince a good one.","Nature hath given not only to the highest, but also to the inferior, classes of the people of this nation, a boldness and confidence in speaking and answering, even in the presence of their princes and chieftains.","Nor do I think that any other nation than this of Wales, nor any other language, whatever may hereafter come to pass, shall on the day of severe examination before the Supreme Judge, answer for this corner of the earth.","The men and women cut their hair close round to the ears and eyes. The women, after the manner of the Parthians, cover their heads with a large white veil, folded together in the form of a crown.","These people being of a sharp and acute intellect, and gifted with a rich and powerful understanding, excel in whatever studies they pursue, and are more quick and cunning than the other inhabitants of a western clime.","Wales was in ancient times divided into three parts nearly equal, consideration having been paid, in this division, more to the value than to the just quantity or proportion of territory."],"Girija Vyas":["There shouldn't be two Indias; we need affordable housing.

However, under Muslim Personal Law, a girl can be married once she attains puberty, and hence we cannot say that such marriages are not valid.","We need to evolve a uniform law which does not leave room for any confusion and states that the minimum marriageable age for women is 18 years and that for men is 21 years. But the demand for this should come from within the community."],"Girma Woldegiorgis":["Thanks to the heroic sons and daughters of this country, who have paid sacrifices, we have been able to score a number of victories which are encouraging the nation-building process we are engaged in.","I wish to express my hope that the efforts of our nations, nationalities and peoples in the direction of the development of our democratic order will be successful.","The labour of the farmers, no doubt is of greater value than the financial capacity of the government and non-government institutions which can only play a supportive role."],"Girolamo Savonarola":["The whole world knows that His glory has not been spread by force and weapons, but by poor fishermen.","It came from God, and so is Christ true, and Christ is thy God, who is in heaven and awaits thee."],"Gisele Bundchen":["I feel like when people judge me they're not judging me, because they don't know who I am.","I'm a very private person. I like staying home and doing my stuff. I hate people invading on my privacy. I hate talking about my private life.","When you come from a big family, you see that, growing up, you're learning how to share. Your sisters have got your back; you're not alone in this - 'We all support you!' Your family provides that; it gives you a sense of safety, and it's a very grounding feeling.","When I'm weak, you can be strong; when I'm strong, you can be weak. That's what I believe marriage is.","Having the strength to tune out negativity and remain focused on what I want gives me the will and confidence to achieve my goals.","Sometimes siblings can get in each other's space.","The most beautiful thing about Brazil that I always find that is so unlike any other place I've been in the world is the diversity of its people.","I always knew that, even if I was not the most beautiful girl, I'd be the most energetic and hard-working. If you want to know the truth, that's the reason for my success.","I love that feeling of, you know, we are women, we are so different, our imperfections are what make us unique and beautiful.","If you are happy, you can give happiness. If you don't love yourself and if you are unhappy with yourself, you can't give anything else but that.","I was eating lots of vegetables and fruit every day during my pregnancy - my baby needed the best of the best, so it was the opposite of overeating. I had this being inside of me, and I was responsible for everything he got.","The more you trust your intuition, the more empowered you become, the stronger you become, and the happier you become.","For too long, the world has been focused on short-term growth and development at the expense of our long-term survival as we have depleted our natural resources at historically reckless rates.","I noticed every time I felt overwhelmed, I would hold my breath. I had to learn to stop, relax, and take long deep breaths, and within seconds I would feel more clear and ready to deal with the situation in a more loving way.","Children are like little angels - there's no way you can't love them.","This is exactly how I would describe my work: 'I get there, I put on the clothes, I leave it on the hanger, and I go home.' And that's what I do.","It's all about the light. Always face it, because that's how you give your face good angles.

So no outdoor pictures between 12 and two!","No one ever said learning was to be easy, but it's part of the process of evolving as a human being, and we all have to go through it. When I look back, I see that each difficult time brought an important lesson. And I prefer to look at it with gratitude because I wouldn't be who I am today if I haven't gone through it all.","I'm one of these people that likes adrenaline and new things, like extreme sports.

I played volleyball and I believe sport teaches you a lot, such as teamwork, respect and discipline.","There is good in everything; it's just how you choose to look at it. Everything that's worth it has a price. For me to be a model - I had to leave my family. Do you think I liked that? No! There are sacrifices. Life is meant to be a challenge, because challenges are what make you grow.","I love outdoor sports, like volleyball, and I play them whenever I can.","If I could choose, I'd be bare feet with animals all around me and living in a tree house. Like Tarzan and Jane, that's my dream. I'm at my happiest around nature.","It was my first scene. My first day. We could have started with me drinking a beer, something a little less than having Barbies touching each other. But they started with that.","The quality of time I get to spend with my family is very important. That way, I feel I am experiencing all the different aspects of my life without guilt.","When I walk down the runway, my main goal is to not think about the people watching. The idea of all eyes on me would make me too uncomfortable. As I step on the runway, I take a deep breath, focus on a point in the distance, and go!","Sometimes doors open and other close and you have to figure out which one you're going to take. I'm always for the one that's challenging. That's where I think you live your life to the fullest.","I feel grateful because I have a lot of love in my life. I found the person I'm sharing my life with. I have a good man.","I'm not a potato sack; I've never sat on my couch. If I'm home, I'm cleaning, feeding my dogs, doing stuff. Life is too precious to waste time.","Love is something that grows, that comes from nourishment; it builds.","I'm a very hyper person.","I don't wear fur and I understand their cause. I am the biggest animal lover in the world. I have four dogs and two horses, and I have rescued animals all my life.","I believe in taking chances and living your life. Sometimes doors open and others close and you have to figure out which one you're going to take. I'm always for the one that's challenging.","I'm a workaholic. I've been doing my job for a long time.","I never really thought about being an actress or being anything like that. I was always a bit scared as well because of the thing about models becoming an actress and all that.","I think it's better when you're natural, when you just do whatever you want, instead of doing classes where I see all these other people holding back because they've been trained with certain skills or techniques. I'm like, whatever.","I'm not an actress, you know. I don't know what's going on. And I'm supposed to be the villain.","I'm very interested in charities. I help a lot of different charities.","It was like two different photographers, and shot in three different locations and it was really fun to do. There were 12 beautiful girls in it. It was great.","I don't like Paris so much, and it's only eight shows. I mean, don't tell them that, of course. But everyone always thinks they're so important. And I'm sure they are. But to me, my happiness is more important.","If you have your wife, and you are proud of something she's done, wouldn't you go and support her in something? That is what I was trying to do.","I did kung fu up until two weeks before Benjamin was born, and yoga three days a week. I think a lot of people get pregnant and decide they can turn into garbage disposals. I was mindful about what I ate, and I gained only 30 pounds.","I felt like my pregnancy was a sacred moment for me. I stayed in Boston and I didn't work apart from the contracts I have, and then I only let them use my face.","There's a button that goes On and I'm On. And when I go On, there is almost no me; there is just a character who is doing all this.","When I came to New York and I opened the window of the thirty-fifth-floor apartment, there's light pollution and fog, and I couldn't see my star. So I drew it on my wrist with a pen, but it kept washing away. Then I went to a tattoo parlor on Second Avenue and had it done.","I cannot put this poison on my skin. I do not use anything synthetic.","I don't like parties. I prefer something more intimate, just for the closest people.","I believe in feeling connected. Love is something that grows, that comes from nourishment; it builds. But there is a great feeling that happens, that is telling you, I don't want to leave this room!","I believe that bringing a life into this world is the single most important thing a person can undertake, and it can also be the most challenging. I think as mothers we are all just trying our best.","Gossip is poison.","I'll never forget the day when a woman came up to me and said, 'No, you could never be on a magazine cover. Your face features don't work; your eyes are small, you have a small face but a big nose.' I was only 14 and I had never noticed any of that stuff, you know?","I think a lot of people get pregnant and decide they can turn into garbage disposals.","I was in the fashion shows in Milan; I was seventeen, I was doing like 100 shows. People were asking, 'How does it feel to be the model of the moment?' It was hard for me to answer as myself. I barely spoke English.","When I was a teenager, I had pimples - oh, God, every time someone looked at my face I thought they were looking at my pimples. I put mud on my face to dry them out, and it worked.","This is our world and we need the same things to survive. If I'm making my life better and the circumstances of your life worse, that's terrible because in the end it will affect me, too.","My son is so fortunate, you know. He's always going to have food. Yes, my children are going to be privileged, but that's why it's so important for them to see different realities and to travel, and they do already.","I have a lot of fruit trees and my own little vegetable garden and chickens. And every time I eat, I bless my food; I say I'm grateful for for it and let it nourish every part of my body.","Everyone has an hour in their day to go and do something for somebody else; I don't care how busy they are.","There should be a worldwide law, in my opinion, that mothers should breastfeed their babies for six months.","I am not the first person to give birth naturally. Billions of other women have come before me and have done this - so why can't I do it?","I want to get a farm where I am going to live for the rest of my life. I like the idea of a secluded place.","I've been doing my job for a long time and I never really thought about being an actress or being anything like that. I was always a bit scared as well because of the thing about models becoming an actress and all that. I just never really took it seriously.","I think people have a different image of me because, you know, they portray me with the idea that models are stupid and dumb; like, 'She can just be a model because she can just be a model - she's dumb and she can't do anything else.'","I am a huge fan of big cotton underpants; they're comfortable. I wear them every day.","If you're wearing smoky eye makeup, a little beige or gold pencil on the inner eye corners will open up the area, but you only want to do it if the shadow is really dark. Otherwise, light pencil makes your eyes look too far apart, like a fish.","I've always been in serious relationships. I meet someone and date him for a long period. I don't sit there thinking, like, 'I wonder if I can seduce that guy.' I have other things in my mind.","I think sometimes you have high expectations for people because you have high expectations for yourself.","Everybody learns from traveling. I think we all do.","I'd be lying if I said, 'No,' to wanting a lot of kids.","My two grandmothers both died of cancer, so I understand how painful and difficult this disease is on the entire family. My first grandmother passed away from bone cancer when I was about 10. It was really horrible. I remember the whole process like it was yesterday.","Christmas and the holidays are the season of giving. It's a time when people are more kind and open-hearted.","People have a perception of me because of Victoria's Secret that I'm sexy, but I'm not a sexy girl. I'm very tomboyish.","To be a mother is a magical experience. The whole body is transformed by this.","Brazil has its own fashion identity. Many very talented Brazilian designers show every season at Sao Paulo and Rio fashion weeks.","People think if you look after yourself you're being selfish, you know.","If I honour my needs first, I will be the best wife, the best mum, the best sister, the best friend. I have to come first, because then everyone benefits.","I'm a woman trying to balance family, work and friends like so many others out there.","I feel privileged to be a U.N. ambassador. It gives me an opportunity to use my voice to help raise awareness about important social and environmental issues.","I think it's great for my boys to have a girl in the house, just to understand at least a little bit about what makes a woman tick - not that I can certainly figure that out, because I can't.","You know, everyone says, 'Modeling and acting are so similar'... they say, 'It's so natural for models to become actresses because they use the camera.' I don't think of it in that way.","Some people start modeling because they want to be models and they want the parties and the recognition, and then there are people like me. I come from a simple family, and for me getting into modeling was a chance to make money and create a business.","No matter how many shows I've done, as soon as they say it's time to start, I get that nervous sensation and feel like I have to pee. So that's where my mind is. That and making it to the end of the runway and back as fast as I can.","Always, always powder your T-zone and the lines going from your nose down around your mouth so you don't look like a bulldog. When those areas are shiny, it's awful. And gloss will keep your lips from appearing dehydrated.","When you get to experience something that is outside of your reality, it changes you.","Because I had my family, I felt like I could be a bird and fly and experience and do. Because I had roots somewhere, I knew that they would love me no matter what, and I could always go back home and they were going to love me.","My intention in making a comment about the importance of breastfeeding has nothing to do with the law. It comes from my passion and beliefs about children.","I think as mothers we are all just trying our best.","It's unfortunate that in an interview sometimes things can seem so black and white.","Sometimes when you are a great mom, you're not so great at your job. And then when you're good at your job, you're not so great of a mom or a good wife. It's a dance that never stops. But it's beautiful.","I don't think anyone likes to see a picture of themselves in a tabloid, besides a couple people who I'm not going to mention. I'm definitely not one of those people.","I wouldn't call myself an actress, but I at the same time, if there is an opportunity... I believe in taking chances and living your life.","I love kids. It's amazing that I have the opportunity to hang out with my stepson all the time.","The mind is more powerful than anything. So, during the birth I wasn't thinking about the pain. I was in a meditation state. I was concentrating the whole time, thinking, 'Oh my God, it's time. I am going to meet my baby. What is he going to look like?'","A woman can look powerful in a party, but when she arrives at home, all she wants is to feel comfortable.","For me the end of the year is always a time to reflect and recharge my energies.","In the beginning, you know, everyone told me, 'Your eyes are too small, the nose is too big, you can never be on a magazine cover.' But, you know what? The big nose is coming with a big personality.","I'm a twin, I'm a Cancer; I'm always taking care of other people. I've always been the fixer in the family, the responsible one.","When I was a kid, I never even thought about fashion. I had one pair of jeans.","I don't like to focus on things that don't make me happy and that I can't change. I'd rather try my best to learn from it and move on.","Yes, Brazil, like the whole world, stands to lose a lot in a climate-altered world. But it's also one of the major forces determining our future: It's the home of most of the Amazon rain forest.","As consumers, we need to demand that companies sell us sustainable products that do not disregard and destroy our natural world.","I'm very nurturing. I come from a large family, and my parents were loving. But the most important thing for me as a mum is to keep my word. When I say no, I mean no.","I'm a model as a job. I'm Gisele, the daughter of Valdir and Vania. I'm a woman; I am a model. When I go home and shut the door, that's it.","My earliest memory was going to my grandma's house, milking the cows, and collecting the eggs from the chickens.","I had to make some adjustments from what my life was like before I was a mom. My kids are so fun and loving, but they are also demanding!","For me, making schedules are critical to make sure we attend to all the needs of the kids and our family. After adding everyone's schedule on the calendar, I make sure that every day I have some sacred time for myself so I can recharge.","It saddens me that in the 21st century, with all our knowledge and power, we are hearing more and more stories of possible extinctions due to people's choice. We are responsible for our choices and the only ones capable of changing our future.","You know that 40 percent of the food in the United States gets thrown away because it doesn't look a certain way. It's crazy: just because the apple is not the right size or the carrot is not straight enough, it just doesn't get accepted."],"Giuliana Rancic":["To me, natural, healthy looking skin is really beautiful. With a little concealer, eyeshadow, liner, gloss and bronzer, I love my lighter makeup look. I've saved so much money on facials!","If you are strong enough as a couple, reality shows can be a good thing for the relationship.","I eat as much as the next girl, but I work my butt of in the gym every morning! The key is moderation. I splurge on the weekend. A big bowl of pasta and a delicious slice of cake for dessert are my favorites.","I just feel such a connection to the little kids in Naples. I remember being on the street wanting a small piece of candy.","We are really looking at all of our options. I mean, listen, whether it's IVF or whatever it is, we want to have a baby and we will have a baby.","A lot of us think we're invincible... but we have to start putting ourselves on the to-do list.","I started realizing I could be an example for women to not just be aware of breast cancer but to act on it, to make an appointment, to give themselves an exam.","A rumor that followed me forever was that my family was in the mafia. For years I had to live with it. They'd call me the mafia princess, so I rolled with it for the rest of high school. People even joke about it today.","To finally get that call from the doctor that you're pregnant and you're having a baby.... It was just another world.","I'm from Naples. I was born in a poor neighborhood and I always, in my heart, felt like it would be amazing to be able to adopt a child from Naples. I could give someone the opportunity I had. I would love to give back in that way and pay it forward.","There is a bigger plan for us. There is some reason we haven't had a kid. Our kid hasn't come yet for some reason. We really believe that.","I would like to take the stigma away. 'Mastectomy' the word seemed so scary to me at first. After doing research and seeing the advancements, the surgery has come a long way from 20 years ago. The results can be incredible.","I want to encourage everyone to be proactive with their health and get checked out.","When I went public with my breast cancer diagnosis six weeks ago, the overwhelming outpouring of love, prayers and support really helped me heal faster. I want to make sure to thank everyone.","One of my first thoughts I had when I started considering the mastectomy was, 'What am I going to look like?' And then, 'What will my husband think?'","Knock on wood, but I think we hit the gestational carrier lottery!","I never thought my marriage could be stronger, or I could be closer to Bill. We prayed on our own, but now we prayed together and you'll never know how much that means until you do it.","When you do a reality show and host shows, it's hard to have secrets.","I have a new found respect for women who have been through breast cancer and this surgery.","There are thin girls with infertility issues, normal sized girls with infertility issues and overweight girls with infertility issues. Unless your doctor tells you your weight is affecting you in some way... once the doctor rules it out, that's really not it.","For me it was just more important to get the cancer out. With the double mastectomy I now have less than one per cent chance of getting it back, otherwise it was 20, 30 or 40 per cent chance and for me it wasn't worth it.","I thought I was dreaming. It was the most amazing moment of my entire life. Not only is Bill the love of my life, but he's also my best friend. I couldn't believe my dream guy was asking me to marry him!","I wasn't prepared to get a mammogram until I was 40 years old, like I'd been told. I never in my wildest dreams expected anything to be wrong.","We really believe that whatever we put our minds to, we can achieve.","I was probably a B student in high school, but it wasn't until I got to college that I said, 'Oh! This is what it's all about.' And then I became an A student. I studied journalism in college and that's what really kicked it into high gear for me.","You can never take your reputation back. There really is nothing as powerful as a good reputation.","I never thought I was pretty enough. I was kind of tall and lanky. I don't mind it now, but back in the day I hated it. I would tell myself that what I think is ugly at 17 is actually what's going to be pretty about me later.","I used to watch 'The Apprentice' all the time and I thought Bill was a fox. That was that, we didn't see each other for years, and then we saw each other and 45 minutes after the cameras stopped rolling, we were still talking.","We've gotten probably 40 women who have offered to be surrogates.","If you know me, you know that nothing embarrasses me. Anything could happen to me on live television, and I sincerely don't care.","I love trainwrecks on live TV.","We were married in Capri almost two years ago and we have made a pact with each other to visit the beautiful island and the church where we were married every year for the rest of our lives.","We're open people. I don't understand these Hollywood people who don't want to put their real life on TV, yet they want people to watch them and be fans with them.","Chicago is incredibly gracious. People here have so much pride.","Through my attempt to get pregnant through IVF, we sadly found out that I have early stages of breast cancer. It's been a shock."],"Giulio Andreotti":["I recognize my limits but when I look around I realise I am not living exactly in a world of giants.","Power tires only those who do not have it.","Power wears out those who don't have it.","Gladio had been necessary during the days of the Cold War but, in view of the collapse of the East Block, Italy would suggest to Nato that the organisation was no longer necessary.","You sin in thinking bad about people - but, often, you guess right.","I should be making plans more for the next world than for this one."],"Giulio Douhet":["To conquer the command of the air means victory; to be beaten in the air means defeat and acceptance of whatever terms the enemy may be pleased to impose.","The one effective method of defending one's own territory from an offensive by air is to destroy the enemy's air power with the greatest possible speed."],"Giulio Natta":["In view of the experience I had acquired in the field of chemical industry, certain Italian government and industrial bodies entrusted me in 1938 with the task of instituting research and development studies on the production of synthetic rubber in Italy.","All vinyl polymers may be regarded as built from monomeric units containing a tertiary carbon atom.","If the polymer chain assumes a helicoidal conformation in the crystalline state, and if it does not contain asymmetric carbon atoms, it can be expected that either helices of the same sense, or, in equal ratio, helices of opposite sense are represented in the lattice.","If the chain symmetry is maintained in the crystal lattice, the possible occurrence of different space groups is considerably restricted."],"Giuseppe Garibaldi":["I offer neither pay, nor quarters, nor food; I offer only hunger, thirst, forced marches, battles and death. Let him who loves his country with his heart, and not merely with his lips, follow me.","To this wonderful page in our country's history another more glorious still will be added, and the slave shall show at last to his free brothers a sharpened sword forged from the links of his fetters.","Yes, young men, Italy owes to you an undertaking which has merited the applause of the universe. You have conquered and you will conquer still, because you are prepared for the tactics that decide the fate of battles.","We shall meet again before long to march to new triumphs.","You, too, women, cast away all the cowards from your embraces; they will give you only cowards for children, and you who are the daughters of the land of beauty must bear children who are noble and brave.","If these hands, used to fighting, would be acceptable to His Holiness, we most thankfully dedicate them to the service of him who deserves so well of the Church and of the fatherland.","The priest is the personification of falsehood.","Let those only return to their homes who are called by the imperative duties which they owe to their families, and those who by their glorious wounds have deserved the credit of their country.","Ah, no, far be from me a thought which I loathe like poison.","I utter this word with deepest affection and from the very bottom of my heart.","Apart from these, let all others remain to guard our glorious banners."],"Giuseppe Mazzini":["A Country is not a mere territory; the particular territory is only its foundation. The Country is the idea which rises upon that foundation; it is the sentiment of love, the sense of fellowship which binds together all the sons of that territory.","Constancy is the complement of all other human virtues.","Insurrection by means of guerrilla bands is the true method of warfare for all nations desirous of emancipating themselves from a foreign yoke. It is invincible, indestructible.","So long as you are ready to die for humanity, the life of your country is immortal.","Music is the harmonious voice of creation; an echo of the invisible world.","The theory of rights enables us to rise and overthrow obstacles, but not to found a strong and lasting accord between all the elements which compose the nation.","Slumber not in the tents of your fathers. The world is advancing.","God has given you your country as cradle, and humanity as mother; you cannot rightly love your brethren of the cradle if you love not the common mother.","Good council has no price."],"Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa":["If we want things to stay as they are, things will have to change.","There is no need to tell you that the 'Prince of Salina' is the Prince Lampedusa, my great-grandfather Giulio Fabrizio."],"Giuseppe Verdi":["You may have the universe if I may have Italy.","I adore art... when I am alone with my notes, my heart pounds and the tears stream from my eyes, and my emotion and my joys are too much to bear."],"Giuseppe Zanotti":["The place where I think social media fails is in showing the knowledge, the tradition of stitching the clothing, of cutting the fabric, of the tannery, of the skinning of the jewels - this knowledge needs respect. Online and social media is the future, but we need to learn from the past, too.","The sneaker comes from sports, but it's couture now. It's not made in Asia: it's made in my little village in Italy. I can customize everything. I use silk and diamonds and crystals. I think my sneakers have a lot of good vibrations.","Trends are dangerous; you will fail if you design for them. You cannot follow the work of others. I have my own DNA, my own formula. I always stay true to myself and to the brand.","A woman can slip on a pair of embellished cage heels one night and a pair of streamlined, lightweight sneakers the next day. The beauty of modern luxury is the absence of rules.","High heels are like a beauty lift. In a flat, you can feel beautiful, but a stiletto changes your mood, how you move - like a wild, beautiful animal. The idea was always to follow a woman's wardrobe, her desires.","Every season, I absorb everything around m:, the people I see on the street, the discos, the art, the music, and the energy of places from my travels. I mix all of this together, and then I begin to create.","When you buy a new pair of heels, walk up and down the stairs 10 times. Stairs are the most difficult thing, so if you can do stairs, then you can do everything else.","You cannot design shoes if you only think about fashion; it's too realistic. When I design, I dream.","People online will tell you what they really think - there's no diplomacy. They're honest; it's good to have the feedback immediately.","At school I was a disaster, but when I would design, I could feel a sense of pride. I've always designed, and I would literally design everything I'd see: cars, bikes, motorcycles - everything.","My family owned a gelateria business, so as a kid, I would always design ice cream cones. If you want to transform a shoe from design into a properly wearable product, however, you need technical knowledge. So I worked for four years inside a local shoe company.","Hip hop is the strongest form of protest there is, and it doesn't always have to be a violent protest. It can be romantic, also. When you listen to Kanye West's 'Street Lights' for example, there's romance, there's pain - you feel the essence. I get the same thing from Drake and 2 Chainz.","Beyonce has very clear ideas - she knows exactly what she wants. The thing which she then also has over other celebrities is that she has an amazing voice. She's incredibly talented, and she's an amazing dancer - she's complete. Few are like Beyonce.","Every time I work with a star, I learn a lot. Also, I teach a lot because I'm a shoemaker, a designer. I'm born with a pencil in my hand. For old teenagers like me it's good to learn.","Sneakers are a new era. Anyone can feel new with a new pair of shoes. They make you feel contemporary. It's fun because I'm not a young designer, and it opens my brain. Hip-hop isn't just for the U.S. Everyone loves it.","You know, 65-year-olds love sneakers because they make them feel forty.","Formal is formal. I can't wear sneakers all the time. Sometimes, I wear other shoes. It's not my challenge designing formal - it's so boring - but it's still important. I sell a lot of classic black sneakers made from every material because everyone loves black, and if you mix and match material, you get an opera.","To love shoes is to love problems. Every season, starting a new collection is my greatest challenge. The blank slate in front of me, starting the process all over again, there is no greater challenge.","Kanye West is a brilliant poet and artist. He and I work in a very similar way. We feel the vibration, the power of something, and it inspires us to create, whether it is music or design. It is the same process. Working with Kanye is a joy and great privilege. In 2012, we did collaboration together."],"Gladys Knight":["God is gracious enough to let us know, in due time while we're here and the fact that I'm still around and I'm still singing, it is really to his glory.","I don't regret any decisions I've made in my life.","Well, I never danced with the 'Pips' - they didn't let me dance!","Believe me when I say this: you can't please everyone in concert, even though I still want to. Someone always wants you to sing a song that isn't necessarily on your set list.","I'm a people lover. I love interacting with different people as I meet them, and I think people are one of God's greatest creations, I really do. They're interesting and intriguing.","I had some great mentors as I was coming up and starting to sing so early - I've been singing since I was four.","I know how hard it is to send two kids to college when you ain't got nothing. I know people may not think of me in that way, but this business gives you ups and downs.","Most people who ask me what's my favorite song, expect that it's 'Midnight Train' or 'Neither One of Us.' But actually, it's always kinda been 'The Need to Be' because of what it says. I love the way that song was written, I love the melody, I love everything about it.","I'm comfortable singing jazz. The only thing I was concerned about is that everybody, even in jazz, has their own style. To me, the queen of doodling was Ella Fitzgerald, and scatting is something I never thought I could do.","When you pay your money to see me, I want you to have the best concert you can have from me.","We all have a responsibility, and since I've been so wonderfully blessed, I really want to share and to make life at least a little better. So every chance I get to share the gospel or uplift people, I will take full advantage of that opportunity.","Soul is just that inner spirit. I use that inner spirit for whatever it is I do.","I had some great mentors as I was coming up and starting to sing so early - I've been singing since I was four. I had people telling me how to preserve myself.","Would you believe that Sammy Davis, Jr. taught me how to sing a ballad? 'You can be in an arena,' he said, 'and you should be able to hold their attention.'","I always kind of thought I want to be a good person, I want to be right to my fellow men and love them like we're supposed to."],"Gladys Taber":["Almost all words do have color, and nothing is more pleasant than to utter a pink word and see someone's eyes light up and know it is a pink word for him or her, too.","The begonia is an amazing plant... it just keeps going along and blooming, and when cut back, it starts up again.","Christmas is a bridge. We need bridges as the river of time flows past. Today's Christmas should mean creating happy hours for tomorrow and reliving those of yesterday.","Business was bound to come; light industries were already shopping for land. The quiet country farms were already going, and developments would take over... Eventually, of course, we will have to have some sort of plan to guide future development."],"Glen A. Larson":["I'm proudest of the fact that I fell in step with an audience taste level that I knew how to judge and maybe deliver for, and consistently.","I call it predicament humor. You don't do anything that cuts the star off at the knees or worse. You make him intelligent; you give him great ideas and great things to do.","I tried to stay with things until I thought they were on their feet and they learned to walk and talk.","If you believe in something, you must will it through, because everything gets in the way. Everyone tries to steer the ship off course.","I was vested emotionally in 'Battlestar.' I really loved the thematic things. I don't feel it really got its shot, and I can't blame anyone else; I was at the center of that.","Television networks are a lot like automobile manufacturers or anyone else who's in commerce. If something out there catches on with the public... I guess you can call it 'market research.'"],"Glen Campbell":["I was very candid in my book because I want people to know the truth... and that people can change for the better.","Life is too short not to enjoy it.","I've laughed, and I've cried. Laughing has got it over crying.","Do everything according to God, and be nice, and treat other people the way you would like to be treated.","There's no pillow as soft as a clear conscience.","Success is not getting what you want, it's enjoying what you have.","I'm a take-me-as-l-am person, and all the rest is water under the bridge. You can't change yesterday any more than you can predict what's gonna happen tomorrow.","The more you play music, the better you'll get.","It was Dec. 22, 1981. I figured I had messed up enough, and I decided to have a little faith and let God take over. It definitely straightened my act up in a hurry.","A good song is a good song.","Picking a guitar was a lot easier than picking cotton.","I don't have Alzheimer's. I have part-timer's.","I was out of control... I was a mess, but God has forgiven me.","There's a longing in country music that can soften even the rockiest heart.","We didn't have electricity when I was a kid. We had to watch TV by candlelight. No, that's a silly joke.","I've been every way there is to be.","I needed a capo - a clamp to hold down the strings - so my daddy made me one out of a corn on the cob and a rubber band.","I guess I'm like Roger Miller who used to say that he didn't have as many jokes as he thought he did.","I like to start the day early, it keeps me out of trouble.","I would have been content to just do studio work, making it on my own never really entered my mind.","Some people have said that I can 'hear' a hit song, meaning that I can tell the first time a song is played for me if it has potential. I have been able to hear some of the hits that way, but I can also 'feel' one.","TV is just an incredible media.","Daddy - I remember when he first let me drive the cultivator for him, you know... He eased you into the hard work that you had to do later.","Ah, the Wrecking Crew! They played on everything that came out of L.A. Oh, that was a good band. You really enjoyed going to work. You played for everyone; it didn't matter what it was.","God saved me.","I'm really not a songwriter, so if I hear a song, I feel it and like it, I'll do it. But I'll make it the way I want to hear it.","If I get a song - a good song - I just sing it the way I hear it in my head. If anybody else wanted to add whistles and bells and chains rattling, that's fine. Just not too much. I actually just do things as straight ahead as possible.","I spent some time in Hell.","I like 'me'/'I' songs.","You don't play around with a good song. You try to just say it right in the proper place, and if you get the music and voice in tune, you'll be all right. That's always worked for me.","I've often asked myself, how much information can the brain actually hold? There'll probably come a day when you're able to download it; that's what you have to do when the machine's full.","God only knows just how much I'm going to do, or not going to do.","I worked my butt off.","Some things I don't want to remember.","I'll tell you, my dad played and sang, and it didn't take me long to figure out that playing a guitar was a whole lot better than getting ahold of a hoe handle or chopping cotton, man.","I listened to a battery radio, old country and pop stuff. Because I was singing all the time, my dad bought me a $7.50 guitar.","We lived on the farm, and our mode of transportation was wagon and team. No electricity. I'm the seventh son of 12 kids - eight boys and four girls. Mom and Dad handled that very well. But I wanted to get out.","I have been very blessed with some great songs.","I like to play golf. You know, make a little money, lose a little money. Get 10 bucks, lose 20 bucks.","I got to play with the big guys, the Wrecking Crew. They just blew me away. I learned a lot of stuff from those guys.","I gave John Wayne the push he needed to get that Oscar.","I still love making music. And I still love performing for my fans. I'd like to thank them for sticking with me through thick and thin.","We moved to Los Angeles because our daughter wanted to go to Pepperdine.","I just wanted to do a music show, with the whole realm of music from Ella Fitzgerald to rock bands like Cream to Kenny Rogers. We had a lot of country, but we did every kind of music. The Monkees were on, and so was Johnny Cash.","I've been through a lot of changes.","I'm an avid golfer.","I go to a great church.","Actually, I believe in the institution of marriage.","It's easier being with somebody who's got some sense.","Our dad taught us not to be a loafer and a slough-off, that you don't blame somebody else for your misfortunes.","God's law is God's law, period. Teach your children that.","All I ever wanted to do was play the guitar; singing was a sideline.","I played on a lot of Sinatra sessions. He was simply awesome. He liked to laugh, and he could be one of the boys when he wanted. But he was also a very serious performer.","When we cut 'Strangers In The Night,' we did the whole song in two takes.","Great stories start with great opening lines. 'I'm a lineman for the county' - what a great way to start a song.","I don't really classify 'Wichita Lineman' as country.","Honesty I can take. Lies I get upset about.","When I did 'Wichita Lineman,' it was as good as I could do it, so I keep doing it that way. It's such a haunting song.","I love symphonies. I love string sections.","To play with a symphony today is just fabulous.","All my records - 'By the Time I Get to Phoenix,' 'Wichita Lineman,' 'Galveston,' 'Rhinestone Cowboy,' 'Dreams of the Everyday Housewife' - they all had strings on them.","If you've got a good melody and a good story married together, that's a good sign for hit-song material.","The very first big one I had was 'Turn Around and Look At Me.'","I love singing. I just love it.","I've been singing and playing the guitar ever since I can remember.","That's what we grew up with - the good songs, the good lyrics, the good big-band stuff. I miss that era.","I felt my music wasn't aiming at anybody. Everything I was doing was because it was a good song.","Music is music. It doesn't matter if I am trying to aim at country or trying to aim at pop.","I am just trying to do a song the best possible way I can.","You don't mess with politics and religion. Leave it alone. People get upset at that sometimes.","I don't hold grudges.","I don't remember not singing. I started when I was, I don't know how - what, two years old or a year old or something like that.","Dean Martin. He was incredible.","I can read a chord chart, but I couldn't read a note chart.","I realize you are going to make mistakes through life. Just don't make any bad ones, you know. Like all of my records are perfect records, but I did make mistakes on them.","I would rather do live than any kind of lip-synching or something like that. I don't like to lip-synch.","I just tell you, the Lord's been good to me. Even if I was a rounder, He's been really, really nice to me.","I can't be alone.","With the first money I got, I built my parents a house back home, gave them a string of credit cards, and said 'Go.'","What I try to do is live with myself and please me. If I can't do that, I can't please anybody else or live with anybody else.","Hank Williams' music - it just doesn't go away, for some reason.","I'm running my life according to what I know to be true from the Bible and the old scribes.","I used to be just a total jazz freak. People used to say, 'Where's the melody? Is there a melody in there anywhere?' Now I let the music follow the song.","They could never put me in a slot. They couldn't say Glen was 'country,' 'pop' or 'rock.' I'm crock, OK? A cross between country and rock. Call me crock.","If we grew it, we ate it. If Daddy shot it, Mamma cooked it.","'True Grit' was fun to do, but I wasn't cut out to be an actor. I made John Wayne look so good, he won his only Oscar.","I learned it was crucial to play right on the edge of the beat... It makes you drive the song more. You're ahead of the beat, but you're not.","I'd have to pick cotton for a year to make what I'd make in a week in L.A.","Elvis was a great singer. He really was.","With the TV shows, you get eight zillion people watching you. I was really surprised at the way everything went. I knew television was powerful, but that was just... wow.","Roger Miller opened a lot of people's eyes to the possibilities of country music, and it's making more impact now because it's earthy material: stories and things that happen to everyday people. I call it 'people music.'","Frankly, it is very hard to remember things from the 1970s.","Perhaps I've found the secret for an unhappy private life. Every three years, I go and marry a girl who doesn't love me, and then she proceeds to take all my money.","I can think of only two or three songs out of hundreds I've recorded that I performed as originally written. I like to become intimate with the material and change it to suit me.","I've always been forgetful.","I have been blessed. I really have.","I play guitar, and it's not a prop.","I'm from so far back in the sticks that they had to pump the light in there.","I saw my first indoor bathroom when I was 9.","I'm not an actor, really. I can play myself pretty well.","I don't miss television. It's too much hurry up and sit around, wait till they do this and do that, and get the lighting just right. I'd much rather go out on a stage anywhere and just play and sing for an hour.","I know it was raw in some places, and I was a jerk in some places, but that's the way I was, and I was stupid.","With a lot of songs, songs that don't make a good statement, I forget the words."],"Glen Duncan":["If being a werewolf is really a curse, you've got to treat it honorably. If werewolves are going to carry on, there has to be an incredibly powerful force. There is the business of the craving, the hunger for the kill. It has to be deeply pleasurable and more than an appetite for meat. There has to be a sensual dimension to it.","Werewolves were far more terrifying than vampires. It is probably the idea of seeing the human within the beast and knowing you can't reach it. It might as well be a great white shark. There is no sitting down and discussing Proust with it, which the traditional vampire model seems to leave room for. You can have a conversation.","Fairy tales read before bed tend to make me dream. They're all quite violent stories, as are my dreams.","I'm too conceited for therapy.","My parents believe in the happy endings to the stories of their children.","I'm with Milton and the Rolling Stones: I don't find the Devil an unsympathetic character. But in any case, my fiction is populated as much by people who do good as it is by those who do bad. I'm interested in imaginatively accommodating as much of the human as possible, for which you need both moral extremes and everything in between.","If I'm going to invest the time in a novel, I want something more than the entertainment you get out of most genre fiction.","One of the things that seems absolutely clear to me about werewolves - with their canine makeup - is that they would be dogs, as it were.","Everyone is obsessed with air fresheners. We associate smell with disgust. But we're all locked into the body; we can't escape it.","Nineteenth-century English literature I know; 19th-century sewage systems, not so much.","What I've absorbed of the gothic or paranormal has come mainly from films.","I'm constantly dogged with a feeling of fraudulence, so if somebody tells me they like what I've written, then I immediately begin to think it's rubbish.","In a fit of pique, I said to my agent, 'I'm going to write something you can sell.' The idea was to write a straight page-turner, with no literary conceits.","There are two ways to write a werewolf novel - you can examine the genre conventions, or you can say, 'What would it be like if I were a werewolf?'","I'm not quite sure when I began to be troubled by the creeping sense of my own ludicrousness, but it persisted - and eventually grew into a fascination. I started writing about it. Thus, in His characteristically mysterious way, the Lord made clear His plans for me.","Until the age of thirteen, I tortured the waiting worlds of book illustration and professional football by shilly-shallying over which of them was going to get the benefit of my inestimable talents.","I'm not very good at story. In fact, compared to character and language, I barely care about story at all.","There are, I'm depressed to say, many classics I have not yet read and will probably never get around to, though I will not stop short of hospitalizing myself in the attempt.","I haven't won any prizes or had any best sellers.","We have all seen werewolf transformations hundreds of times on screen.","We have grown up in an age where there is nothing that cannot now, courtesy of computer-generated imagery, be convincingly rendered in the visual field.","I read John Irving's novel 'The World According To Garp' when I was about 14 or 15. It was the first grown-up book that I had read. It is the story of a young man who grows up to be a novelist. I finished it, and I wanted to write a book that made the reader feel the way I felt at the end of that, which was sort of both bereft and elated.","For a long time, I'd wanted to write a book that I would be proud and happy and psychologically and morally comfortable about my parents' reading.","I find the ideas of Catholicism incredibly rich and inspiring. Bogus, unfortunately, but nonetheless inspiring. I think they always provide an interesting nexus through which to look at the way we are.","I will waste an extraordinary amount of time, you know. And if it's not watching television, I'll be sitting staring out of the window. And yes, I know there's the idea of the artist, sitting there doing nothing while things are going on, but actually, no. It's vacant space. I'm thinking about the laundry.","I don't think things happen for a reason, but I think it's perfectly possible to experience life meaningfully.","I am a man of lost faiths.","I used to believe in signs, omens, patterns, secret purpose, synchronicities.","I still want magic, I find. The old fashioned kind. I don't believe in it, but I still have a hankering for it.","While I was writing 'The Last Werewolf,' I didn't watch any horror movies.","We're in the age of the series, trilogy, boxed sets.","My position is that you've got to accommodate everything. I don't morally accommodate but imaginatively accommodate.","My family is Anglo-Indian, and of the four children, I'm the only one who wasn't born in India.","The winter of 1991 found me stunned and shivering in the aftermath of an imploded love affair. Being 26, I flung myself actorishly on London and, without any intimations of my own ludicrousness, spent two years showing God what I thought of Him by letting myself go.","I, made in England, felt excluded, miffed, resistant to the idea of even visiting India, a position of increasing absurdity as, one by one, backpacking friends returned from the place with the standard anecdotal combo of nirvanic epiphany and toilet horror.","For the minimum-wager with Caligulan needs, the glory days are soon over.","Cheney, Rumsfeld - they were Shakespearean in their attitude of impunity.","Life would be much easier if I just wrote the same book over and over again. But I'm not interested in doing that.","As an Anglo-Indian kid in Bolton, I was basically in a minority of one. That was a source of misery, but at the same time, one of the effects of receiving the message that you don't belong to the club is that you watch the club with detachment. The fact that no one quite knew who I was was a major contributory factor in starting to write."],"Glen Hansard":["Our imagination just needs space. It's all it needs, that moment where you just sort of stare into the distance where your brain gets to sort of somehow rise up.","A song is like a saddle: you ride it for a while, and if it's the right kind of song you can sing it for the rest of your life.","Well, everything about singing, I learned from busking. Everything I learned about songwriting, I learned from busking.","The moment of drifting into thought has been so clipped by modern technology. Our lives are filled with distraction with smartphones and all the rest. People are so locked into not being present.","Sadness is a very interesting idea, this idea of sadness being some kind of default setting that artists will go into. And then I started thinking about this idea of sadness and happiness, and the idea that sadness is very loud, and happiness is quiet.","I only ever really take out my guitar when I'm miserable, which isn't necessarily a very good time to do it.","And for some reason, when I'm sad, I do listen to Leonard Cohen, I do listen to Joni Mitchell. I do find myself going to the music that's actually reflecting my mood, as opposed to sticking on Motown, which might actually bring my mood up.","This weird thing that musicians have... it's got something to do with approval, and not feeling good enough, and therefore going out and being great somehow makes your life valid.","And I've always loved playing solo.","I guess in a way I just feel blessed to be able to make music.","Do I create conflicts for myself? Sure I do.","I've always felt that if I ever got cynical, I would have to stop making music because I'd just be poisoning the air.","I choose to believe that there is good in people and that everything is a lesson. Our place on Earth is to go deeper, to somehow get wiser. To have spirit.","Sometimes travelling really intensely for a long time is like having a continuous nervous breakdown.","My life at home is super simple. My local bar with my mates, cooking for my mother, making tables, planting vegetables: It's the classic idea of the artistic existence.","My dad was quiet, angry, shut down. So my thing is: I express everything that's there. I want to get it all out.","If you don't mark your successes, the day your ship comes in could be just another day at the office, and there's no poetry in that.","There are people who can sit down and write a song about any given subject, and they can do it really, really well.","What happens to us all, I think, when we pick up a pen, is that we just become snobs.","I busked from the age of 13 until I was 18.","Well, playing a guy who writes songs and busks on Grafton Street in Dublin and falls in love with Marketa Irglova wasn't very difficult for me. There was very little acting going on.","I won't say I've closed the door on acting.","You know, albums are a funny thing. They're not like an intellectual decision. It's a collection of your kind of musings.","I've realized, you know, having turned 40, that rest is just as important as work. In fact, it's equally as important.","You know, when I was a kid waiting on the bus, I remember that was when I imagined my life. I imagined everything that I was gonna be when I grew up and I imagined all of these amazing journeys and amazing people I'd meet. Of course, all of it has kind of come to fruition.","If you stand still in any city long enough, you see everyone pass you by. So you're in Chicago. If you stand on the corner of Belmont and Clark, and you do that for three years, you'll pretty much have seen everybody in Chicago pass that junction.","As a busker, one thing that does not work is self-consciousness. A busker needs to be working. A busker needs to shed all ego and get down to work. Play your songs, play them well, earn your money, and don't get in people's way.","In Irish law, busking is considered vagrancy - you can be arrested for it. It's risky asking people for money in public. So it's not like it's a high-art job. And people who do it as a high-art job make very little money.","I love the idea of leaving some of the original abstract thought in, because the problem is that when you pick up a pen you become a snob, your own worse critic. You edit yourself in a way that is non-creative.","The muse holds no appointments. You can never call on it. I don't understand people who get up at 9 o'clock in the morning, put on the coffee and sit down to write.","Keeping the pen out of your hand as much as possible is the best way to write a song, in my estimation. But the pen must come in to tighten it up.","I pick up my guitar and play. Something might come, and then the pen comes out. Then an edit, until something comes out that you're actually satisfied with.","Sometimes you give birth to something or you're part of a team that gives birth to an idea, and it grows and has a whole life of its own, and you feel grateful. It's just so humbling."],"Glen Mazzara":["If you're going to run a small business, you need to know what everyone is doing, be the first one in and the last one out, and work weekends.","The key things I learned as a hospital administrator are to be organized, communicate, and be flexible.","I went to NYU undergraduate, then for a Master's in English, and got a summer job at St. Vincent's. I was a ward clerk handling everything in an intensive care unit.","I created a show called 'Crash' for Starz, which was their first original drama, and that was not a good experience. I had a great time working with the cast and crew, but it was a young network and an intrusive studio, and to be honest I didn't really enjoy the movie 'Crash.'","Don't forget, I've been fired by studios; I'm not the studio's guy. I'm a guy who can work with studios, but if you ask any studio, I stand up to these people.","When you're managing an emergency department, you're trying to keep everybody calm, so when an emergency comes in the door, everyone can do their best work.","A lot of what I do as a showrunner is anxiety control. People get nervous when they don't know what's going on, so a big part of my job is making sure everyone has all of the information all of the time.","Sharing information with employees makes them feel invested.","That's the holy grail as a TV writer, to work on a story that you care about and to put it out there and for it to find the audience and connect with fans and connect with critics.","I think horror films always have to be as simple as possible.","One of the things I've learned by working on the 'Walking Dead' and other TV shows is to be more tolerant of other people's process.","It's better to grow your employees, steer them into a place that they can learn and succeed, and want to work hard and be loyal, than to have a revolving door of employees. That's demoralizing."],"Glen Taylor":["I don't view my opinions as the right ones; they are just different.","I think it's important to talk to your inner thing. The purpose is to go over the decisions that will affect my life and others. I pray that I don't make my decisions based on ego.","We didn't really feel poor. You don't know that as a kid, but we really didn't have any cash. When machinery broke down, we didn't have money for parts, so we did our best to fix it.","I thought I might like to farm. But I didn't know the economics of it. Teachers basically steered me away from it.","I'm a mathematician by education, but I have this other thing. A gut instinct.","I was raised on a family farm in western Minnesota. So I didn't have the background to prepare me for this business life.","I have degrees in social science, math and physics. Everything but business.","For small businesses trying to figure out how to get big, I would say you are going to have to take some risks. And I think that is what shuts off most people. They are not willing take the risk."],"Glenda Jackson":["I look forward to growing old and wise and audacious.","I told them I wouldn't sign a blank cheque.","When I have to cry, I think about my love life. When I have to laugh, I think about my love life.","I've always been ambitious to be very good at what I do.","I used to believe that anything was better than nothing. Now I know that sometimes nothing is better.","My money goes to my agent, then to my accountant and from him to the tax man.","I have never believed you make your case stronger by bad-mouthing your opposition.","I want to do a musical movie. Like Evita, but with good music.","If I'm too strong for some people, that's their problem.","It would be nice if education was free to everyone who wanted it, but that's not the world we live in.","Acting is not about dressing up. Acting is about stripping bare. The whole essence of learning lines is to forget them so you can make them sound like you thought of them that instant.","One hell of an outlay for a very small return, with most of them.","You've got to sing like you don't need the money.","Men can be a great deal of work for very little reward.","Why put make-up on when you only have to take it off again?"],"Glenn Beck":["What is the point of competing for a trophy if everyone gets a trophy?","Without failure there is no sweetness in success. There's no understanding of it.","Remember, beneath every cynic there lies a romantic, and probably an injured one.","People should be free, people should be unencumbered by regulation as much as possible, that big government always goes corrupt and the truth shall always set you free.","I beg you, look for the words 'social justice' or 'economic justice' on your church Web site. If you find it, run as fast as you can. Social justice and economic justice, they are code words.","We all have our inner demons.","'Hello my name is the Republican Party and I got a problem. I'm addicted to spending and big government.' I'd like one of them just to stand up and say that.","And I've come to the place where I believe that there's no way to solve these problems, these issues - there's nothing that we can do that will solve the problems that we have and keep the peace, unless we solve it through God, unless we solve it in being our highest self. And that's a pretty tall order.","What I'm trying to do is get this message out about self-empowerment, entrepreneurial spirit and true Americanism - the way we were when we changed the world, when Edison was alone, failing his 2,000th time on the lightbulb.","We're giving our freedoms away. The American experiment was about freedom. Freedom to be stupid, freedom to fail, freedom to succeed.","I am a conservative, but I am not a zombie.","Let me tell you, it is still morning in America. It just happens to be kind of a head pounding, hung over for four hours in America - and it's shaping up to be a nasty day, but its still morning in America.","I believe that if we get out of people's way, the sky's the limit. The sky is the limit.","You know, we all have our inner demons. I, for one - I can't speak for you, but I'm on the verge of moral collapse at any time. It can happen by the end of the show.","Political Correctness doesn't change us, it shuts us up.","What does it mean to be a conservative? I don't even know anymore. I know what it means to me. It means to me, personal responsibility. That if I've done something wrong, its up to me to pay the price. It's up to me to make it right.","Not a single time have we gotten a right from Congress or from the President. We get them from God.","It does not have to be that the greatest generation is behind us. It does not have to be that our children will have a lower standard of living. It will be that way if we choose to believe that. I choose not to believe that.","When did it something of shame or ridicule to be a self-made man in America?","Progressivism is the cancer in America and it is eating our Constitution, and it was designed to eat the Constitution, to progress past the Constitution.","We should reject big government and look inside ourselves for all the things that built this country into what it was.","You can get rich making fun of me. I know. I've made lots of money making fun of me.","Timothy McVeigh was a coward. Violence is the stupid way out. It'll discredit any real legitmate movement.","We just put General Motors in the hands of people who can't even run our own government.","I am like Howard Beale. When he came out of the rain and he was like, none of this makes any sense. I am that guy.","Good for you, you have a heart, you can be a liberal. Now, couple your heart with your brain, and you can be a conservative.","The most used phrase in my administration if I were to be President would be 'What the hell you mean we're out of missiles?'","It's a real blessing for me to tell you, sir, that calvary has arrived - Fox is here!","What we don't have a right to is healthcare, housing, or handouts. We don't have those rights.","No one is guaranteed happiness. You can pursue it, but if you happen to find success along the way on that road to happiness, Conservatives believe you should not be demonized or penalized for it.","The majority does not rule in America, but the minority shouldn't hijack it. And it's because we're afraid. They have isolated us and made us feel as though we're alone. We're not.","We all know what the problems are: it's tax and spend. One party will tax and spend, the other party won't tax but will spend. It's both of them together.","I have not heard people in the Republican Party yet admit that they have a problem. And when they do say that they have a problem I don't know that I believe 'em.","It's not just spending, it's not just taxes, it's not just corruption, it is progressivism, and it is in both parties. It is in the Republicans and the Democrats.","Every time the government grows we lose more of who we are.","When did it become a problem to be a small businessman and become successful? The small businessman - like my father, or like me?","Americans also don't need to be taught how to give. We don't need to be taught how to take care of each other or how to be charitable.","To restore America we need less Marx and more Madison.","Please stop teaching my children that everyone gets a trophy just for participating. What is this, the Nobel Prize? Not everybody gets a trophy.","The worst is still ahead of us. But no one in Washington has the spine to tell you that.","If you have a priest that is pushing social justice, go find another parish. Go alert your bishop.","I think every American has a role in saving this country. Whether you're Democrat, Republican, independent, it doesn't matter. We all know the country's in trouble. We may disagree on how to solve it, but we all know the country's in trouble.","The message that I gave on the - on the steps today was that you need to stand for those things that are right and empower the individual. Believe in the power of one person. Don't believe that you can't do it. Everybody wants - everybody wants a shot. That we can all agree on. Beyond that, it becomes politics. I'm not talking politics.","Let me go over this again on the reclaiming the civil rights movement. People of faith that believe that you have an equal right to justice - that is the essence. And if it's not the essence, then we've been sold a pack of lies. The essence is everyone deserves a shot - the content of character, not the color of skin.","I have no desire to be president of the United States. Zero desire. I don't think that I would be electable. And there are far too many people that are far smarter than me to be president. I'd like to find one with some honor and integrity. I haven't seen them yet, but they'll show up.","When I was young, I used to hear people say, 'He's a golden boy. Look at that guy. Can you imagine what he's going to be like when he grows up?' Well, I unfortunately bought into that. And I hadn't even found myself. Quite honestly, I was running from myself. But I knew how to work Top 40 radio.","Quite honestly, I was running from myself. But I knew how to work Top 40 radio.","I was in Washington, D.C., on the morning show, by the time I was 18, programming a station by 19, No. 1 in the mornings. I think I was making, I don't know, a quarter of a million dollars by the time I was 25.","By the time I was 30, nobody would work with me. I was friendless, I was hopeless, I was suicidal, lost my family - I mean, it was bad. Bottomed out, didn't know what I was going to do. I actually thought I was going to be a chef - go to work in a kitchen someplace.","You've got to demand the truth from yourself.","I'm a dad, and I no longer see a way for my kids to even inherit the money that I'm making, let alone go out there, have an idea, and create it in their own lifetime.","I'm not interested in breaking news. I'm interested in telling the story of what's going on and then trying to figure it out.","I can multitask like crazy. I'm riddled with ADD - a blessing and a curse.","I was one of the hardest-hitting conservatives on George W. Bush. Republicans didn't like me on George W. Bush. Republicans still don't like me on many things. If any Republican thinks I've been hard on Mitt Romney or Newt Gingrich or any of these guys, wait until Mitt Romney gets into office. I'll hold his feet to the fire just as much.","A country is made not by policy alone, but by its music, its entertainment shows, all of it.","When you live in an alcoholic family or an abusive family, you tiptoe, you don't want to step on any mines.","My father told me abuse is generational.","Oprah is wildly successful, and she's a brilliant businesswoman. She's also somebody who's overcome a ton of demons in her own life, and that's really what shaped her. I think the same could be said for me.","I don't fancy myself a political commentator. I hate politics. I hate it.","When you're true to yourself - not the audience that reads about me in the newspaper or sees a clip someplace, but the audience that actually comes and watches, just like Oprah - they get to know you and they sense something genuine.","Music is the language of the heart, and conservatives always screw it up.","I am going to take something I learned over in Israel. Their Independence Day is preceded the 24 hours before with Memorial Day, so it gives them a chance to serve and reflect and then celebrate. I am going to try to start that tradition here in America.","I wasn't just pro-choice, I was pro-everything, until I started taking everything off the table and began looking at things and asking if this view was consistent with that view.","I'm the whitest guy you will ever meet. The first time I saw an African-American, my dad had to tell me to stop staring.","I have found there are four steps to change. 1. You must want it. 2. You must believe it. 3. You must live it. 4. You will become it.","I am a conservative who happens to not be a Republican."],"Glenn Close":["Acting, to me, is about the incredible adventure of examining the landscape of human heart and soul. That's basically what we do.","The best thing I have is the knife from Fatal Attraction. I hung it in my kitchen. It's my way of saying, Don't mess with me.","It always amazes me to think that every house on every street is full of so many stories; so many triumphs and tragedies, and all we see are yards and driveways.","Love makes no sense at all. But it's the most powerful and amazing force in the entire universe.","Celebrity is death - celebrity - that's the worst thing that can happen to an actor.","You have to love the characters you play, even if no one else does.","I love the chemistry that can be created onstage between the actors and the audience. It's molecular, even, the energies that can go back and forth. I started in theater, and when I first went into movies, I felt that my energy was going to blow out the camera.","When I hear that somebody's difficult, I think, Oh, I can't wait to work with them.","I'm an actor, that's my contribution.","With the hugely talented women I've worked with or observed, it's not a question about temperament or ego; it's a question about getting it right. If they've got a reputation for being difficult it's usually because they just don't suffer fools.","When they tested Fatal Attraction, the audiences were so upset by her behavior, they literally demanded her blood.","We were fortunate enough to have several good books detailing the camps and the women. Some were by the survivors. I also got to talk to some of the women who had been in the camp, survivors.","We have to be vulnerable as actors, but we have to protect ourselves.","There's something about a catharsis that is very important.","There are a lot of big spec houses now all across Connecticut, a lot of ostentatious showing of wealth.","It's not good to be in a situation where people don't want to direct you or don't want to question something.","It puts you in a kind of a strange situation where everybody is looking at every little thing you do.","It is very difficult for girls. They're told to look one way, but to act another way.","Ismail Merchant was just the most seductive, passionate, outrageous, driven, genius of a man.","I've been sacrificing my life for my work for 30 years, and now I want it the other way around. I want to find work that fits into my life and that would be based here.","I think there are certain actors that have that kind of energy about them, that taking over a room energy.","I think the diva is kind of a cliche. My definition of a diva is somebody whose talent does not match what they're trying to play, so all this temperament comes out.","I never got into this business thinking I'd be like a movie star.","I knew the term Stepford Wife, and I knew what that meant. I never read the book, and I think before I started filming I watched the movie. I thought it was very dated.","I had a great time on The Shield. From working on it I have a totally different view of law enforcement.","I had a dresser who literally squeezed me in like Scarlett O'Hara in Gone With The Wind.","I get bored talking about myself, but I can talk about the work.","I don't think the tabloids find me very interesting.","I don't like public venues. I never know what to wear.","I am extremely shy. I am not happy in crowds of people.","Good roles are hard to find no matter what age.","Diva has a negative connotation.","Bunny boiler is now part of our language, and I'm proud of that.","As an actor, I go where the good writing is. That's the bottom line.","It's gotten out of control. It's taking bigger and bigger names to make smaller and smaller films. I worry that important films without a big name attached won't get made at all."],"Glenn Danzig":["It seems like time slips out of your hands. You wake up, and 2-3 years have passed.","We're doing Circle of Snakes, we open up with Skin Carver and we are throwing in Skull Forest later on.","I don't see any holy wars being fought in the name of Satan.","Until the contract is signed, nothing is real.","To some people heavy metal is Motorhead and to others it's Judas Priest.","I just play music, you know what I mean? That's what I want to spend my time talking about.","It's annoying when someone's in front of you driving ten miles an hour, and you're like, 'Okay, today,' and someone else is on the side of you, so you can't pass them, and when you finally do pass them and they are texting, the laser cannons just come out and disintegrate that car.","I like to stay busy. I am a workaholic, and I like to be creative.","We're one of the only bands that get censored for theological commentary.","The occult - what do you mean, Jesus? That's occult to me. It's so far-fetched, it's ridiculous.","I've seen a bunch of the 'Portlandia' episodes, and they're pretty hilarious.","We probably put about four or five comic books out a year and probably about two or three art books and various trade paperbacks - maybe four or five of those a year - and that's what we do now.","I was bringing my attitude as a regular person 'cause this is my attitude.","Everyone thinks L.A. is the beach. And actually, Hollywood is really far from the beach.","Whether or not the devil is really good or evil is something that we don't really know.","I had a situation where Bill Clinton sent the F.B.I. after me.","If I can make people forget whatever they're dealing with for an hour and a half, two hours every night, that's nice.","There's all kinds of schisms in Satanism, but the thing I like about it is the quest for knowledge.","Of course, I started really being a comics fan with the underground stuff in the '70s.","My view on Democrats is that they're fascists disguised as liberals, or liberal moderates. You're not allowed to say anything they don't agree with. You're not allowed to do anything.","What irritates me are bands that pretend they've never heard of the Misfits or Danzig, but they've got the skeleton shirt.","In Japan, they have TV sets in cars right now, where you can punch up traffic routes, weather, everything! You can get Internet access already in cars in Japan, so within the next 2 to 3 years it's gonna be so crazy!","I just told you I wasn't a Satanist.","You know I take music seriously, right? So I expect journalists to take being a journalist seriously.","But unfortunately, I have to say, one out of every 100 interviews I do, I get a real journalist.","Yeah, now we publish whenever we feel like it.","We still have pretty good sales, especially for the art books.","Whether I'm doing music or I'm walking down the street or I'm in a record store buying a record or I walk into a comic store and I'm buying comics or having a drink with my friends, it's the same me.","I think the key to being a journalist is getting your subject to feel comfortable enough to talk about stuff they want to talk about and the stuff they like and don't like, and still feel comfortable about it.","We've had a lot of agencies try and sabotage our tour.","I'm just saying that at least for the foreseeable future there won't be any more touring.","I know they are going to be doing a box set in Europe of Danzig 5 and 6 and some other stuff.","But the Danzig unreleased stuff will be either a single or a double CD.","It's not like that anymore really, but back in the day, nobody would let the Misfits open up for them, not the Ramones, not the Cramps, nobody.","I don't think there's a back lot here in Hollywood anymore that has those streets, like a French Quarter.","The Democratic party has gone so far to the left that people just can't relate to it anymore and the Republican party is trying to go totally to the right.","People don't realize that they're being played by the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, but more so by the Democratic Party because the Democratic Party does not want another party in there.","I wish the Libertarian Party would get more play in the media but they don't.","I think the Democratic Party has picked a lot of the wrong candidates, the kind that Middle America, or people who are more down the middle and more rational, can't side with. I think that's been the problem.","Wars have always started over religion.","So writing a song is much harder than doing a classical piece for me, because in a classical piece, I can just let the mood dictate what's going to happen.","But when you get to a song, not only do you have to do a vocal melody, you have to write words and not be redundant and make some semblance of a story.","Al Gore wanted to tell people what they could listen to and what they couldn't, what they could record. It was basically coming down to the idea that he wouldn't let anybody record any music that he didn't think you should be doing. There was going to be an organization that would tell you what you could and couldn't record.","My idea of covers is that you should never cover a song and do it exactly like the artist because everyone's always going to compare it to the way the original artists did it, and they're just going to go, 'Oh I like the original better.'","If you're working with a producer like Rick Rubin or whatever, you sing each line probably 30 different ways. Each time, they're like, 'Can you try it this way? Can you try it that way?' That's each line in the song, for each song.","I don't really go to the beach.","When I grew up as a kid, a part of my life - I grew up in Boston near Revere Beach, at my grandma's, and she would take me to the beach.","I was watching TV once, and 'Jailhouse Rock' comes on, and I'm like, 'What is this?' I started watching it, and at the end, I thought, 'This is what I want to do. That's what I want to be. That's for me. That's it!'","I hadn't done a photo cover in a while, and I decided to do a take on the 'Pin Ups' cover, but do it in skull face and have the girl in skull face. People seem to dig it.","However you feel about Dimebag, this is one of the most influential metal guitar players of the '90s. I was just talking to someone that I am hiring to bring on the tour who said that, when he was at the funeral, that Eddie Van Halen came and put his striped guitar in the coffin. That's a pretty big deal.","You'd be surprised the type of people who are into metal when you see them. Sometimes I'm even surprised, but it's cool. That's the reason it's still around.","I'm a big Fred Armisen fan.","I like Bill Murray a real lot. I like Andy Kaufman.","I don't think anyone in my family was funny.","Sometimes on a tour bus, we watch comedy when it's slow.","I don't think any punk bands really ever got their due.","So many big magazines just dissed the whole punk thing as nothing, but really, it was a big thing. It really changed, and that's what we wanted to do - change the system.","I like the original Metallica version they did on 'Garage Days' - 'Last Caress' and 'Green Hell.'","I love giving the energy and getting the energy back. There is nothing like it.","Although I have been pretty vocal about hating touring, the only part of touring I don't like is being on the bus and bouncing around.","Two hours onstage... that's the best part because it makes it all worth it.","The thing that has never changed is I do what I want to do. If I can't do what I want to do, I don't want to do it.","My attitude with covers is, make it your own or else leave it alone.","When I write, I write the drum beat. Though sometimes I write on piano or guitar.","I hate iPods.","I like albums. I like holding them, seeing what they're all about, you know? I like reading liner notes. Even if it's a CD, you're getting kind of an idea of what the band is coming from. Or what they want you to think they're coming from. I like that.","I don't even listen to music on the road, and if I did, it would be classical or whatever, something to chill me out.","CDs sound so much better than MP3s. I'm sure they'll come out with a better format someday.","I always want to do - take everything and take it to the next step. I don't want to just keep doing something the same ol' thing. Obviously, I could have wrote 'Mother' 20 times and made tons of money and be playing gigantic arenas and whatever, but that's not really what I want to do.","I'm lucky that I can stay busy and people are interested in what I do. I have fantastic people that are into whatever I do, which is great. I try to keep myself happy and them happy.","I've always tried to expand what heavy or loud music was and where it can go and what it can do.","It's what's missing, I think, from most music - the rebellious part. That rebelliousness is part of great rock music or great literature or any great creative stuff.","The most rebelliousness I see now is coming out of WikiLeaks and D.C. Leaks and BlackListed News.","All that pop that you see on the radio? It's just the worst crud I've ever heard in my life. It's designed to make money, and that's about it.","Pop music doesn't challenge anything.","For me, it shouldn't just be a live show: it should be an experience. It should be some kind of crazy, tribal, exhausting experience.","Back in the days, we had to work with a shoestring budget. We had a movie screen, and we'd show movie trailers on them, and then we'd rip through it and started playing. Now we have a little money to play with to do a cool stage set.","It's pretty crazy the amount of people that have covered my songs.","It's funny I'm talking to 'Rolling Stone' right now, because back then, it was like, 'Punk rock? Put it back. It's just a flash in the pan.'","David Bowie's death came out of the blue, as did Prince's.","If you're a music fan, you think these artists will be here forever, but you should enjoy them while they're here, because you never know what will happen.","I'm a workaholic, and so I've always got to be doing stuff.","I try to work out, but a lot of hotels don't have gyms anymore, so I always try to find a local gym where there's not a ton of 'roid-heads, 'cause I can't stand them. It's tough.","Diet is really important, and I think vitamins are really important, also.","If I can help it, I don't go to modern doctors.","I don't know that I'm not normal, because usually, when I tell people the things I do, either their jaw drops or they look at me shocked, but I'm sure I do normal things - everyone eats, that kind of stuff.","It really annoys me when the light turns green, and you're behind somebody, and they're just sitting there looking at the light for about 15, 20 seconds.","My opinion of covers is that unless you're going to change and take a cover in a new direction, it's gonna get put up against the old one, and you're gonna lose. It's like, which would you rather listen to? The Righteous Brothers' 'Loving Feeling' or Hall and Oates' 'Loving Feeling?'","When your car rattles when you drive, you know you are playing cool music.","I have an old Shelby '68 Mustang that I don't drive.","Comics are a dying art. If you ask a little kid to choose between a video game with insane graphics or comic books... you have to compete with cable, satellite TV with its thousands of channels, and with video games that are like movies, with CGI explosions where you can blow up worlds.","Comics are printed on paper, which is expensive, making it tough to stay in business.","While I am here, I want to maximize my time on this planet, you know.","I like being out onstage in front of everybody, getting that energy and giving that energy. Hopefully I am making them forget about all their problems in the world. For however many hours they are at our show, hopefully they are going to have a great time, and it makes life a little more bearable for everybody involved.","I love the energy, and I just love watching people lose their minds and be happy and exhilarated. There is nothing like it.","If there's going to be another Misfits record, I'd probably have to write the stuff.","America was founded on satanism.","It started getting too crazy with 'Earth A.D.' The concepts started becoming too brutal and violent. It was less about fiction and more about the real world, the past, present, and future. I think a lot of people got freaked out by that.","My image is dark and sombre. It fits my personality. The problem I always had with the people in the Misfits was that it was a put-on. You wouldn't see those guys walking around like that.","Anyone who knows me or my past knows that I never walk away from a fight.","I don't follow trends. I just do what I like doing.","As a little kid watching horror movies, if you only got to see the monster for the last two minutes of the movie, I thought that movie pretty much sucked.","I don't like a lot of drama on the road - I don't like prima donnas.","The choruses are important for me. I want to say something, and sing-along is great.","Some of the best sing-along stuff you'll ever hear is Gary Glitter.","No trick or treaters came to my house for Halloween. For some reason, people around here are scared of me.","I know kids like Beavis and Butt-head.","Sometimes I was like Beavis and Butt-head growing up. I know people who lit their friend's house on fire accidentally.","When I started Samhain, I remember a producer telling me that I had a real band now.","Anyone who knows me, and most of my fans, know that I have a sense of humor.","A long time ago, Prince said that no musician is ever gonna make money off the Internet, and he was right.","On Sirius, I can find anything I want. They have about four or five different metal channels, rock channels; there's a whole Elvis channel.","Growing up, just singing in bands, I didn't have the same kind of voice as everyone else."],"Glenn Ficarra":["All the lessons you learn in film school from the people you hate are always the ones that are important. The lessons you think are great and thankful for never end up meaning anything to you.","Everyone's always waiting for someone to falter.","A lot of directors keep writers away because the writers know the script better than anybody, obviously they do, and they have certain intents. But a lot of people would be surprised to know that writers are pretty flexible when it comes to their work.","When you make a movie with plenty of money, there is no drama.","When you do a low budget movie, you get a little over-ambitious."],"Glenn Ford":["If they try to rush me, I always say, I've only got one other speed and it's slower.","Nothing ever changes as far as Westerns are concerned. They are the same today as they were years ago.","One thing led to another and I didn't have to take tickets any more because I now worked for Mr. Rogers. He said if I was going to take care of his horses than I'd better learn how to ride. He was very kind to me.","I can't frankly see much difference in the film industry at all. The only difference might be that they don't take as much time as they used to. For example, they'll do in one day what we used to take a week to do.","I think the director is becoming more important. To work under rushed conditions, you need to have an extremely professional director. If the director's good than the end result will be good.","I don't know how it is now but the assistant stage manager had to understudy several parts. You had to be ready to go on at any time if the actor couldn't make it to the play. I didn't think anything of it.","I suddenly realized that the fellow who didn't show up was getting about fifty-times more money than I was getting. So I thought, 'this is silly,' and became an actor. I certainly never thought I'd wind up in motion pictures. That was far beyond anything I'd ever dreamed of.","I was making a film called The White Tower at the foot of Mont Blanc - the one thing I learned from that experience was that it's more difficult to go down a mountain than to go up. A lot of people don't realize that.","William Holden and I weren't just good friends. He was my very best friend. I feel his loss very much still.","He was very commanding, and you had to know what you were doing to work for Mr. Rogers. I learned how to ride very quickly with him as my riding teacher.","It really doesn't matter whether it's the villain or the hero. Sometimes the villain is the most colorful. But I prefer a part where you don't know what he is until the end.","An actor should be ready to play any role within reason. For example, I think the most ridiculous thing for me to do would be to try and play Shakespeare.","An actor would be foolish to do something that might hold up the picture, or more importantly incapacitate him. If an actor does do a stunt he needs to make sure a stunt man stands by to see that it's done correctly."],"Glenn Frey":["I'm just a bleeping maniac in straight clothing. There's no reason to dress my monster up.","Without a reunion, the Eagles are forever young, like James Dean.","If you get a chance to be in a film, that's great. One of my goals is to make a record as good as Don Henley's album, Building the Perfect Beast.","The last two years with the Eagles were pretty intense times. There was a lot of drinking and we were all getting high a lot. My parents were relieved when I got off the Eagles treadmill.","Except for a few guitar chords, everything I've learned in my life that is of any value I've learned from women.","Hey, a woman changed her mind - what else is new?","Hey, I didn't make a big deal out of Hotel California. The 18 million people that bought it did.","I read the Life magazine articles about free love and free dope in California. At age 20 I drove to Los Angeles.","I think it would be nice to sell 15 million albums as a solo artist. I'd have to deal with all the repercussions of that, but that wouldn't be too bad.","I think musicians and artists are the most philanthropic people I know. Their charity record of the music business would hold up to the work of anybody.","I won't apologize for ticket prices. I think we're well worth it. We consider ourselves in the elite touring acts, like the Stones, Elton John, Paul McCartney.","I'm just as insufferable and useless as every other dad is. The dynamic never changes, no matter what you do for a living.","I've read somewhere that when you're writing, you should stop while you're doing well so you always want to go back to work.","If the Eagles were to get back together, it would have to be for the right reasons. I think it would look awful if it were just for the money.","It seems when I put together records, as Henley used to say, they're just like movies. They should have action, tension, love scenes, places to relax.","It was 1967, and the hippie thing was happening. I got into experimenting with drugs while I was in college in Michigan.","My songs grow on people - like warts.","Nobody told Don Henley or me that we were going to make it as solo artists, but I can speak for Don when I say that we are both really happy now that the band is not together.","Some people, they just don't get a joke.","Somebody asked my friend Bob Seger, Why do you think the Eagles broke up? He said, Hotel California.","That's what I miss out of all this synthesized music - it starts to lose dynamics.","There are only those certain people where things click - at least for me."],"Glenn Gould":["One does not play the piano with one's fingers: one plays the piano with one's mind.","By the time I was six, I made an important discovery that I get along much better with animals than humans.","I cannot bear assaults of any kind, and it seems to me that the Beatles essentially were out to affront and to assault.","The purpose of art is not the release of a momentary ejection of adrenaline but is, rather, the gradual, lifelong construction of a state of wonder and serenity.","Until I was about 13, somehow I managed to assume that everyone reacted to everything just about as I did. I took it for granted that everyone shared my passion for overcast skies. It came as quite a shock when I discovered that there were actually people who preferred sunshine.","I don't much care for the sunlight or bright colours of any kind.","I could read music before I could read.","I detest audiences. Not in their individual components but en masse... I think they are a force of evil.","To me, the ideal artist-to-audience relationship is a one-to-zero relationship. The artist should be granted anonymity.","I think there's a fallacy that's been concocted by the music teachers' profession, to wit: that there's a certain sequence of events necessary in order to have the revealed truth about the way one produces a given effect on a given instrument.","I love the early sonatas; I love the early Mozart, period. I'm really fond of that moment when he was either emulating Haydn or Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach or anybody but himself. The moment he found himself, as conventional wisdom would have it, at the age of 18 or 19 or 20, I stop being so interested in him.","I find myself more genuinely drawn to the essence of Beethoven in Schnabel than I ever have been by anybody.","Behind every silver lining, there's a cloud.","I'm fascinated with what happens to the creative output when you isolate yourself from the approval and disapproval of the people around you.","When I broke 20, I said to myself, 'I will give concerts until I'm approximately 30.' And I made it a year and a half late, but, nevertheless, that's what I did. When I broke 30, I said, 'I think I should be recording until I'm about 50.'","There's a very curious and - and almost sadistic lust for blood that overcomes the concert listener, and there's a waiting for it to happen: a waiting for the horn to fluff; a waiting for the strings to become ragged; a waiting for the conductor to forget the subdivide, you know? And it's dreadful!","Chopin, Schubert, and Liszt had no idea of how to write for the piano.","Beethoven's reputation is based entirely on gossip. The middle Beethoven represents a supreme example of a composer on an ego trip.","Concert pianists are really afraid to try out the Beethoven Fourth Concerto if the Third happens to be their specialty. That's the piece they had such success with on Long Island, by George, and it will surely bring them success in Connecticut. So first there's tremendous conservatism. And then stagnation sets in. Or it certainly did in me.","I treat recorded tapes the way a film director treats his rushes.","Fingers don't have much to do with playing the piano. The idea that they do must be unlearned.","I don't think any of the early Romantic composers knew how to write for the piano... The music of that era is full of empty theatrical gestures, full of exhibitionism, and it has a worldly, hedonistic quality that simply turns me off.","Perhaps the most important thing that technology does is free the listener to participate in ways that in all previous periods of listening were governed by the performer.","It's true that I've driven through a number of red lights on occasion, but on the other hand, I've stopped at a lot of green ones but never gotten credit for it.","Isolation is the one sure way to human happiness.","At concerts I felt demeaned, like a vaudevillian."],"Glenn Greenwald":["I personally think honestly disclosing rather than hiding one's subjective values makes for more honest and trustworthy journalism. But no journalism - from the most stylistically 'objective' to the most brazenly opinionated - has any real value unless it is grounded in facts, evidence, and verifiable data.","Surveillance breeds conformity.","It shouldn't take extreme courage and a willingness to go to prison for decades or even life to blow the whistle on bad government acts done in secret. But it does. And that is an immense problem for democracy, one that all journalists should be united in fighting.","The definition of an extreme authoritarian is one who is willing blindly to assume that government accusations are true without any evidence presented or opportunity to contest those accusations.","Whatever one thinks of the justifiability of drone attacks, it's one of the least 'brave' or courageous modes of warfare ever invented. It's one thing to call it just, but to pretend it's 'brave' is Orwellian in the extreme.","It's always easy to get people to condemn threats to free speech when the speech being threatened is speech that they like. It's much more difficult to induce support for free speech rights when the speech being punished is speech they find repellent.","An elite class that is free to operate without limits - whether limits imposed by the rule of law or fear of the responses from those harmed by their behavior - is an elite class that will plunder, degrade, and cheat at will, and act endlessly to fortify its own power.","Very few people use landline phones for much of anything. So when you talk about things like online chat and social media messages and emails, what you're really talking about is the full extent of human communication.","Ultimately, the reason privacy is so vital is it's the realm in which we can do all the things that are valuable as human beings. It's the place that uniquely enables us to explore limits, to test boundaries, to engage in novel and creative ways of thinking and being.","The most important thing my grandfather taught me was that the most noble way to use your skills, intellect and energy is to defend the marginalized against those with the greatest power - and that the resulting animosity from those in power is a badge of honor.","There's a huge dichotomy between people who grow up with alienation, which, for me, was invaluable, and people who grow up so completely privileged that it breeds this complacency and lack of desire to question or challenge or do anything significant. Those are the types of people who become partners at the corporate law firms.","You can't cheer when political officials punish the expression of views you dislike and then expect to be taken seriously when you wrap yourself in the banner of free speech in order to protest state punishment of views you like and share.","Many of the benefits from keeping terrorism fear levels high are obvious. Private corporations suck up massive amounts of Homeland Security cash as long as that fear persists, while government officials in the National Security and Surveillance State can claim unlimited powers and operate with unlimited secrecy and no accountability.","Somehow, when the authoritarians on the Right search for icons of manly warrior power to venerate, they find only those who like to melodramatically play-act as such, but who ran away when it came time to actually perform.","Long before, and fully independent of, anything Congress did, President Obama made clear that he was going to preserve the indefinite detention system at Guantanamo even once he closed the camp. President Obama fully embraced indefinite detention - the defining injustice of Guantanamo - as his own policy.","The single most remarkable (and revealing) fact of the Obama presidency may very well be the lack of a single prosecution of Wall Street executives for the massive fraud that precipitated the 2008 financial crisis.","The Obama administration leaks classified information continuously. They do it to glorify the President, or manipulate public opinion, or even to help produce a pre-election propaganda film about the Osama bin Laden raid.","There is a massive apparatus within the United States government that with complete secrecy has been building this enormous structure that has only one goal, and that is to destroy privacy and anonymity, not just in the United States, but around the world.","The American Right has an amazing ability to lionize leaders whose lives are the precise antithesis of the political values that define their image.","Obama supporters pretended that his 2008 campaign was some sort of populist uprising even as Wall Street overwhelmingly supported his candidacy.","'Terrorism' itself is not an objective term or legitimate object of study, but was conceived of as a highly politicized instrument and has been used that way ever since.","The highest compliment one can give a writer is not to say that one wholeheartedly agrees with his observations, but that he provoked - really, forced - difficult thinking about consequential matters and internal questioning of one's own assumptions, often without quick or clear resolution.","We know that U.S. voters, and world leaders, allow Obama extraordinary leeway when it comes to deadly drone strikes, precisely because of his politics, character and background. (We are talking about a man, after all, who won the Nobel Peace Prize while ordering the automated killing of suspected Muslim terrorists around the world).","It is true that the Internet can be used to disseminate falsehoods quickly, but it just as quickly roots them out and exposes them in a way that the traditional model of journalism and its closed, insular, one-way form of communication could never do.","Free speech rights means that government officials are barred from creating lists of approved and disapproved political ideas and then using the power of the state to enforce those preferences.","The virtue of gay equality has become increasingly recognized in the U.S. because people have been persuaded of its merits, not because state officials, acting like Inquisitors, forced people to accept it by punishing them for their refusal.","As for the claim that drone 'pilots' are not engaged in the extinguishing of human life via video games, the military's own term for its drone kills - 'bug splat,' which happens to be the name of a children's video game - and other evidence negates that.","There are few things more dangerous in a democracy than allowing a President to wage secret wars without the knowledge of the country.","We know with certainty that the Obama administration has re-defined 'militants' to include any military-age males they kill regardless of whether they were actually doing anything wrong. We know with certainty that the U.S. Government has detained and publicly branded as 'terrorists' people they knew at the time were innocent.","There's a perennial debate about whether the propagandistic tripe produced by establishment media outlets is shaped more by evil or by stupidity. Personally, I think it's both: a healthy dose of each is needed. The system design is malicious, while those who serve as its public face are generally vacant.","A common criticism of establishment journalists entails comparing them to stenographers, on the ground that most of them do little more than mindlessly write down and uncritically repeat what government officials say.","If establishment journalists were to replicate actual stenography, it would be an improvement on most of the work they produce.","It is beyond dispute that President Obama and his aides have an extreme, even unprecedented obsession with concealing embarrassing information, controlling the flow of information, and punishing anyone who stands in the way. But, at least theoretically speaking, it is the job of journalists to impede that effort, not to serve and enable it.","I have nothing but the highest regard for 'Salon' and its commitment to independent and provocative journalism.","Even when influential political and media figures vehemently complained about the criticisms I wrote, Salon's editors unfailingly stood behind my work.","What made Guantanamo such a travesty - and what still makes it such - is that it is a system of indefinite detention whereby human beings are put in cages for years and years without ever being charged with a crime.","I've praised Obama's record on same-sex equality as enthusiastically as anyone: it's one area where his record has been impressive. I understand, and have expressed, the emotional importance for LGBT Americans of his marriage announcement as well as its political significance.","Many American pundits and foreign policy experts love to depict themselves as crusaders for human rights, but it almost always takes the form of condemning other governments, never their own.","Who cares if virtually the entire world views Obama's drone attacks as unjustified and wrong? Who cares if the Muslim world continues to seethe with anti-American animus as a result of this aggression? Empires do what they want.","I absolutely believe that another 9/11 is possible.","It isn't those of us who oppose American aggression in the Muslim world who need manipulative, exploitative reminders about 9/11; it's those who cheer for these policies who are making a follow-up attack ever more likely.","Virtually every one of the most far-right neocon Bush officials - including Dick Cheney himself - has spent years now praising Obama for continuing their terrorism policies which Obama the Senator and Presidential Candidate once so harshly denounced.","Virtually every time the U.S. fires a missile from a drone and ends the lives of Muslims, American media outlets dutifully trumpet in headlines that the dead were 'militants' - even though those media outlets literally do not have the slightest idea of who was actually killed.","I've always said that my favorite aspect of online political writing is how interactive and collaborative it is with one's readers: that has always been, and always will be, crucial in so many ways to what I do.","It's hardly news that the Obama administration is intensely and, in many respects, unprecedentedly hostile toward the news-gathering process.","The United States government in Washington constantly gives amnesty to its highest officials, even when they commit the most egregious crimes. And yet the idea of amnesty for a whistleblower is considered radical and extreme.","My inbox is the enemy.","To me, it's a heroic attribute to be so committed to a principle that you apply it, not when it's easy, not when it supports your position, not when it protects people you like, but when it defends and protects people that you hate.","In essence, I see the value of journalism as resting in a twofold mission: informing the public of accurate and vital information, and its unique ability to provide a truly adversarial check on those in power.","Embedded in 'The New York Times'  institutional perspective and reporting methodologies are all sorts of quite debatable and subjective political and cultural assumptions about the world. And with some noble exceptions, 'The Times,' by design or otherwise, has long served the interests of the same set of elite and powerful factions.","Whistleblowers are typically rendered incommunicado, either because they're in hiding, or advised by their lawyers to stay silent, or imprisoned. As a result, the public hears only about them, but never from them, which makes their demonization virtually inevitable.","The Obama administration does not hate unauthorized leaks of classified information. They are more responsible for such leaks than anyone. What they hate are leaks that embarrass them or expose their wrongdoing. Those are the only kinds of leaks that are prosecuted.","The purpose of whistleblowing is to expose secret and wrongful acts by those in power in order to enable reform.","A key purpose of journalism is to provide an adversarial check on those who wield the greatest power by shining a light on what they do in the dark, and informing the public about those acts.","Government and businesses cannot function without enormous amounts of data, and many people have to have access to that data.","The American national security state is totally bipartisan. My biggest problem is with the Democrats, like Feinstein and Pelosi, who are defending it because there is a Democrat in the White House, and they are party loyalists and hacks before they are public servants.","The Obama administration says we only destroy the privacy of non-Americans. That is not true. The government is spying on Americans.","My nature is that when I see abuses of power, I want to expose those abuses.","You can't have a pristine house with ten dogs, and I'd rather have the ten dogs.","When I was talking to strangers over the Internet in the 1990s, there would be a much more intense connection because they're disembodied, so it's just your brain and your soul interacting with this other person, and it just frees you up in this incredibly empowering way.","The point of asylum is not to declare to the world what country you think is the pinnacle of civilization. The point of asylum is to find a country that's both willing and able to protect you from political persecution. In no way is asylum an endorsement of a country's politics, laws, or values.","I've always thought stability was suffocating and deadly. Like, when I read that the kids I went to law school with have stayed at the same firm, I feel like I'm reading an obituary. How much money do you need? Six million, seven million? Put that in the bank and do something else. Get out!","I think Dianne Feinstein may be the most Orwellian political official in Washington. It is hard to imagine having a government more secretive than the United States.","The most extremist power any political leader can assert is the power to target his own citizens for execution without any charges or due process, far from any battlefield. The Obama administration has not only asserted exactly that power in theory, but has exercised it in practice.","The core distortion of the War on Terror under both Bush and Obama is the Orwellian practice of equating government accusations of terrorism with proof of guilt. One constantly hears U.S. government defenders referring to 'terrorists' when what they actually mean is: those accused by the government of terrorism.","The primary theory embraced by the Bush administration to justify its War on Terror policies was that the 'battlefield' is no longer confined to identifiable geographical areas, but instead, the entire globe is now one big, unlimited 'battlefield.'","There are different ways that kids who are gay take on the rejection and alienation they feel. The way I dealt with it was to say, 'You know what? You're imposing judgments on me and condemnations, but I don't accept them. I'm going to instead turn the light on you and see what your flaws are and impose the same judgmental standards on you.'","Even if we're not doing anything wrong, there are certain things we want to do that we don't think can withstand the scrutinizing eye of other people. And those are often the most important things that we do. The things we do when other people are watching are things that are conformist, obedient, normal, and unnotable."],"Glenn Gronkowski":["If you go off the Senior Bowl, that's basically what I can do. I played H-back, I played fullback, I played tight end, I played slot receiver, I ran routes, I caught some balls, blocked, just doing that stuff.","I love being a part of the family and all that. I can't complain about it.","The Patriots are known for winning and all that, so coming to a team like this, the atmosphere is just awesome around here.","It's definitely fun being a part of this family.","When it's time to go to work, it's time to go to work.","Just listen to your coaches; pay attention to what they're telling you to do.","Obviously, you're being evaluated every single week, and you want to perform every single week. It's just going out there and doing everything possible to help the team win.","All my brothers, they deserve all the respect they get from everybody. I've seen all the hard work they put in first hand. The deserve everything they got.","I've never been in trouble with the law.","I'm not doing anything dumb; I'm not getting in trouble.","I've actually never played with any of my brothers before. They've always been too old for me.","We've been training since we were small. You definitely got to love it to be part of this family. We like to have fun. We like to work hard, and always staying out of trouble and always doing the right thing.","To have five brothers be successful in sports is awesome.","I'm very versatile, very dynamic, and I can work around in a lot of places.","Versatility and being dynamic in the NFL is what you need to have because there are only so many roster spots. So, being able to help out in a lot of spots and on special teams is key.","I didn't really fight with any of my older brothers. Mostly just Rob. Basically, all the memories I have are getting beaten up by him.","I consider myself more of a hybrid player than just a fullback.","I have no problem lining up running back, tight end, or fullback.","To get my master's, obviously that would be something special.","I was only used as a fullback at K-State - I wish I was used more.","I've always been labeled... people think things are handed to me.","There's always people that say stuff about you. I just want to go out there and prove them wrong, and that's what motivates you.","I was mainly a blocker in college. I mainly lined up in the backfield at fullback.","I can play a lot of positions, but obviously I haven't had a lot of practice at those different positions.","I want to play a big role on special teams, too.","Football's not forever.","You have to have fun in life.","I just try to come out here, do my best, and try to help the team anyway I can.","I can do it all, and I want to do it all. Put me on special teams. Ask me to block. Hand off. Catching passes.","Work hard, never stop, do anything.","I'm intense. I play hard, and I love to show that."],"Glenn Hoddle":["I have a number of alternatives, and each one gives me something different.","Only 38 per cent of players in the Premier League are English; that is a damning statistic. Soon, the England manager will have to go scouting for players in the Championship - and when I say 'soon' I mean the next four or five years, perhaps even for the next World Cup.","The old adage that you shouldn't change a winning team doesn't apply in modern international football because managers have to study the opposition and pick players who exploit their weaknesses.","At this moment in time I did not say them things.","I run an academy in Spain for young footballers who are released by their clubs and who, in my opinion, deserve a second chance. It is a rewarding job for me, but one that also reveals many of the faults in the English game.","As England manager I always felt we needed an extra man in midfield to retain the ball, but that was more as an attacking ploy to help create opportunities. It came from my experience playing international football in a 4-4-2 and spending half my time chasing the ball.","My saddest decision in football was leaving Paul Gascoigne out of the 1998 World Cup finals. But he wasn't fit enough and once that decision is made, as a manager and a group of players, you forget about who isn't there and focus on the job.","You and I have been physically given two hands and two legs and half-decent brains. Some people have not been born like that for a reason. The karma is working from another lifetime.","It was my proudest moment as a manager when England drew 0-0 with Italy in Rome to qualify for the World Cup finals. Fifteen years later, the stakes are equally high for both countries as they go head-to-head for a semi-final place at the European Championship.","I often felt as a player in a 4-4-2, you end up being outnumbered in midfield and chasing the ball, so as a manager I liked wingbacks to push forward; it gives the midfield player on the ball three or four options.","I started the 1998 World Cup with Teddy Sheringham up front but always planned for Michael Owen to face Colombia in our final group game because they defended square and a quick striker would be able to exploit the space behind them.","I have been here before as a spirit - this is just my physical body, it is just an overcoat. And at death, you will take the overcoat off.","If people feel 4-4-2 is the way forward in international football, they'll have to wait until I'm out of a job.","Nobody criticised me when we qualified for the World Cup when I decided that the best shape for us going forward was three men at the back and stretching the pitch width-wise, which gives you options.","No manager in the world gets good results all the time and you know there's people always ready to have a snipe. In fact I'm my own biggest critic, I really am. Because my own standards are so high, I criticise myself behind the scenes more than perhaps I should, according to people who know me well."],"Glenn Howerton":["I take my work very seriously, and that's the only way for it to be fun for me.","I'm really bad at writing jokes.","One of the things that makes any good entertainment, whether it's a play, drama, comedy, television, film, whatever, is that you feel a certain amount of spontaneity.","I always thought it'd be fun to write something, but it never was an ambition of mine, per se.","One of my biggest pet peeves is that I just don't like it when characters do things that are funny to the writer, but you don't know why they're doing it and it doesn't make any sense."],"Glenn Hubbard":["To me, entrepreneurship means something different. I think of it as identifying and valuing opportunity.","Gradual fiscal consolidation may also be stimulative in the short run.","President Obama has basically avoided or not done any attempt to intervene in any positive way in the housing market. I think in the financial crisis that's been a shame.","In response to the recession, the Obama administration chose to emphasize costly, short-term fixes - ineffective stimulus programs, myriad housing programs that went nowhere, and a rush to invest in 'green' companies. As a consequence, uncertainty over policy - particularly over tax and regulatory policy - slowed the recovery.","The Obama administration's attempted short-term fixes, even with unprecedented monetary easing by the Federal Reserve, produced average GDP growth of just 2.2% over the past three years, and the consensus outlook appears no better for the year ahead.","The Obama administration's large and sustained increases in debt raise the specter of another financial crisis and large future tax increases, further chilling business investment and job creation.","President Obama has ignored or dismissed proposals that would address our anti-competitive tax code and unsustainable trajectory of federal debt - including his own bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform - and submitted no plan for entitlement reform.","What Governor Romney is proposing is an across-the-board cut in marginal tax rates for households, every household in America by 20 percent. And we'll have to broaden the base to pay for that. Also, a very deep cut in the corporate rate.","I can't imagine an argument that says that raising marginal tax rates on high income people, many of whom are business owners, is a recipe for economic growth.","We pursued the wrong policies. George Bush is not on the ballot. Bill Clinton is not on the ballot. Mitt Romney is on the ballot, and Barack Obama is on the ballot. And Mitt Romney is proposing tax reform, regulatory reform, a wise budget strategy and trade. The president has proposed tax increases.","I think Governor Romney has a two-part budget plan that very much levels with voters far more so than any candidate in my lifetime.","The real issue for the public is to figure out which narrative do we want. We can have a bigger government, if that's the public's choice. It'll just require higher taxes on every American. Do you want that, or do you want smaller government, smaller taxes?","I think the ethos for Gov. Romney is to use a whole variety of policies, of which tax policy is one, to try to raise the rate of growth. We've had a recovery from the financial crisis that would be well below what one might normally expect for a recovery from such a deep recession. And to counteract that we need better tax policy.","I don't expect the U.S. and China to get into a trade war simply because I think there are good people on both sides who realize that that's not in either economy's interest.","I can't give political advice to politicians.","I don't accept as an article of faith that lots of short-term stimulus boosts the economy and gets us back on the long-term trajectory."],"Glenn Hughes":["Listen to your inner-voice: Surround yourself with loving, nurturing people. Fall in love with your art and find yourself. Music is the great communicator.","I was very famous as a young man and I celebrated both the good and bad times with drinking.","I heard the Beatles and the Stones, and Mom bought me an electric guitar. I played lead for four years and then switched to bass. One day someone suggested that I should sing, so I sheepishly stepped up to the microphone and the rest is rock history.","I love the art form of songwriting. I get to carry a lot of vibes to a lot of people. My songs are all about the human condition, and people will be able to find themselves in my songs.","When I sing, I pick out people in the audience and pinpoint on them. So if you feel that I am singing just for you, you may be right!","Some people might go to the gym and swim laps, but I write songs. Every single day, I write something new and record it.","When I embraced the rock hat, when I put it on two or three years ago, when I realized I'm gonna go and make really focused rock albums, it felt like wearing an old shoe. It was a perfect fit.","Am I the man who killed Deep Purple? I don't think so. I think every band from that era, even if you look at Led Zeppelin, if you look at their first four albums, they're extremely different from one another, and I've never made the same album twice.","A lot of other bass players have told me I'm the only bass player who plays with a pick but sounds like he's playing with the thumb and fingers, which is a great compliment.","Playin' bass runs and singin' lead vox, is sometimes difficult, but I have three words for you: Practice, practice, practice!","I think I'm better than I was in my younger days, because I'm exploring deep lyrical material, and I've been sober for a while now.","I think the greatest records we've ever heard, from Zeppelin to Purple to Sabbath to The Who, were all recorded in the studio live.","Every single day, I write something new and record it.","I joke to people in the press that I realize I'm not black, I'm actually white. But I've got these roots in black American music. I love it.","I'm not driven by the mighty dollar."],"Glenn Ligon":["Artists such as Lorna Simpson, Zoe Leonard, Byron Kim and Stephen Andrews and I are around the same age, and I know them personally. The discussions I have had with them over the years have influenced the work that I have made throughout my career.","A lot of my work is about text taken to the point of abstraction.","I don't know if I would describe myself as a political artist.","I'm a formalist. I'm interested in the history of painting.","Art points to things. It's a way of giving people not the standard way of looking at the world.","I'm interested in when language fails, when it is opaque.","I really don't have a clear trajectory at all.","Obama is the first African-American president, and for some people, that means a great deal, and for some people, it means very little.","Literature has been a treacherous site for black Americans because literary production has been so tied with the project of proving our humanity through the act of writing.","I'm not an Abstraction Expressionist, but I think dedication to paintings comes from an early interest in that work.","If something sticks with me for a long time, it goes into a painting.","In writing, something is always left out: it can't be articulated in the space of an essay.","There is an imagined thing called black culture. But culture is a construction. It is learned behavior, not innate. The black American experience is the American experience.","I make art to figure out what I'm thinking, not to tell people what I think.","I graduated from Wesleyan University with a B.A. in art. I was really headed toward an architecture degree, but when I did the requirements for the major, I realized I was more interested in how people live in buildings than in making buildings. I was more interested in the interactions that happened inside the structures.","In '89, I got a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. That's when I started to get into group shows. Suddenly, I sort of 'came out' as an artist.","I love Monk's song, 'Just a Gigolo.' It's probably a minor song for him, but whenever I hear a recording of him playing it, I'm mesmerized because Monk clearly loved pop music. He took it very seriously and made an amazing thing out of it.","Sol LeWitt had a huge influence on my work because of his use of repetition and his clarity, setting up a system and letting that system go. That's kind of where the text paintings came from.","What I realized is that my interest in literature has more deeply structured my practice than I thought.","In 2011, 'Yourself in the World,' a book of my writings and interviews, was published in conjunction with a retrospective of my work at the Whitney Museum of American Art.","I don't cook, and I don't care to, but Gabrielle Hamilton made me realize that food is about love and connection. And she has had a hell of an interesting life.","Claudia Rankine's book-length poem 'Citizen' was nominated for National Book Critics Circle awards in the categories of poetry and criticism. It is one of the most devastating takes on American culture I have read in a long time, laying bare the stakes of being black in a country long ambivalent about our presence here.","There was a time when I was a huge TV addict. I used to race home from school to watch 'Dark Shadows.'","I like having a studio to go to. It's like having a job.","In high school, driver's ed was at the same time as drama class. And I had to take drama class. Now I can sing the lead in 'Oklahoma!,' but I can't drive.","It's an artist's job to always have their antennas up.","I have been interested in neon for a long time. The first neon I made was in 2006, using the word 'America.'","My mother used to say that when I told her that I wanted to be an artist, her famous line was, 'The only artists I've ever heard of are dead.' It just wasn't in her experience... I don't think she had a sense that one could be an artist, because there wasn't anyone in my family who had done that.","I took a very small image and blew it up to enormous scale. What happens when you do that is that the information in the image starts to become indistinct. The image darkens.","I was in the 1993 Whitney Biennial and the 1994 'Black Male' show at the Whitney, and I've never seen such vicious press. Twenty plus years later, critics who hated that Biennial have come to Jesus and decided it was a really important, seminal show that they misunderstood.","An artwork is an arrangement of things. The ideal show for me would be if everything touched, literally touched, so that everything would blur together.","The Carrie Mae Weems photograph 'Blue Black Boy,' I thought, was fantastic.","'A Small Band' was commissioned for the facade of the Central Pavilion at the Fifty-Sixth Venice Biennale in 2013.","I met Obama once, backstage at the Apollo in Harlem.","Much of my work is engaged with 'America' - the idea of America.","Things like Ferguson and Eric Garner show us there's an unequal distribution of forward momentum in America.","So much of my work has been about disappearing.","One of the interesting things about quoting in an artwork is that there is a repeated confusion about who is speaking - one essentially becomes the author of a quote one uses.","Throughout African-American literature, the writer has, in a sense, been burdened by the necessity of pleading the case for the whole race. For example, writers of slave narratives tend to lose their individual voices, as they were expected to stand in for all other voices, which were absent.","Race is not something inherent to one's being: One does feel more or less colored, depending on the situation.","Rather than say art is art and life is life, I like to say that they're joined and inextricable.","The public schools in our neighborhood were so bad that the teachers in the school said you shouldn't send your kids here. My mother called around and found a school that was willing to give both me and my brother scholarship money. It's a classic story about black parents wanting more for their kids than they had for themselves.","Is there such a thing as black art? Or are there just artists who are black?","Language controls how you are perceived by others, and in that sense, it is a prison.","Black and white is so familiar. It's how we see the printed word in books, so it's kind of neutral in a way. Yet it's ironic that black and white is so charged socially, what with its association with race.","Doors have an immediate familiarity. They're everywhere. They're scaled to our bodies, so there's something human about them."],"Glenn Miller":["By giving the public a rich and full melody, distinctly arranged and well played, all the time creating new tone colors and patterns, I feel we have a better chance of being successful. I want a kick to my band, but I don't want the rhythm to hog the spotlight.","Why do you judge me as a musician, John? All I'm interested in is making money.","I haven't a great jazz band, and I don't want one.","I thought I had swell ideas, and wonderful musicians, but the hell of it, no one else did."],"Glenn Quinn":["Not to sound egomaniac or anything, but just to get under people's skin like that, and for them to believe in you and believe strongly enough to write... it's flattering and it helps you during the day.","As soon as I did, everything, the whole room, just clicked.","There's a lot of Doyle in me. I don't know where I begin and Doyle ends or where Doyle begins and I end.","When they first cast me, I was a pretty avid fan and vampire movies and Celtic mythology, so I was excited to get a chance to walk in Doyle's shoes and have fun with it."],"Glenn Thompson":["My whole professional life has been dedicated to improving access, affordability, quality and choice of health care.","My goal is to reach out to communicate every day, whether I'm in Washington or in the congressional district. In Washington, the best opportunity to do that is on the House floor. It's both a responsibility and an opportunity. I enjoy, every day, taking to the House floor to address an issue or event that is significant for constituents.","Obamacare is terminal. It is going to fail under the crushing weight of its own flawed design.","I spent 28 years working in healthcare. I thought I'd retired from non-profit community health care.","I obviously disagree with the individuals who do not support rural America and do not support rural airports. Under their philosophy, maybe we shouldn't even be paving roads in rural America, because there are fewer people that drive on them."],"Glenn Tipton":["And because of the reunion I think we've got more energy and enthusiasm than we've ever had. And it's genuine. I think the fans can detect when you're genuine, when you love what you do, and we love to be there on stage. That's what we thrive on.","You can have a bad day, but as soon as you set foot on that stage it's joyous.","We love not just Judas Priest music, but we love heavy metal and we love to get out on that stage every night and perform. It's a joy to be able to do it.","I've got the luxury to tailor make the songs so I can sing them.","I think we all appreciate it now just how lucky we are to be in a band like Judas Priest.","There are right and wrong reasons for doing solo projects, and this album was done for the right reasons. At the time there was no Judas Priest and I certainly wasn't going to hang my hat up on my musical career.","You have to get to know your voice and its strengths and play on those. It took me quite a long time.","Yes, we are fortunate because as a band we've always been on the up, always getting more successful.","Yeah, but on the U.S Tour we threw a new song into the set almost every night. Ofcourse, you can't do too many new songs every night as they've never heard it.","There are a lot better musicians than me out there that just haven't had the luck to fall into everything like I have.","Then I decided I couldn't just crawl in the corner and die, so I started putting pen to paper and wrote some songs. I had no idea what for or who I was going to work with. I tried to find my way and direction.","The hardest part is to travel, and to be away from your family.","Shortly after that, we got management problems over in England, and Judas Priest asked me to join.","Sadly, I've seen a lot of bands hit that sort of peak and then eventually start supporting again, you know, which we will never do. We always put a lot of thought into the way that we are going to go, and we always change.","My vocal ability is very limited, but I'm fortunate in that I can write the songs around my vocal limitations.","It'll be basically a live album, but it will also include songs, Judas Priest songs, the audience have never heard before, because we felt we wanted to give the kids something else, something they haven't already bought.","It was about working with other musicians, but more than that it's about exploring musical areas that you could never do with the band you're in, in my case Judas Priest. You could tackle musical areas and lyrical areas that wouldn't be appropriate for Priest.","If you're not enjoying yourself, you can't really look as if you are.","I'm a married man and I've got two children, and you have to do sacrifices.","I started out myself rather late you see, I was 18.","I have a lot to do with the writing, and also the production, but it would be wrong of me to say that I'm the most important member of the band, because everybody is important the way I see it.","But this is what I want to do, and it is what I will continue doing until Judas Priest finishes, which, at the moment, I can't see that yet. It could be three years or five years, who knows?","A lot of bands that reunite do it for the wrong reasons. They do it for the bucks and everybody can sense it."],"Glenn Turner":["Worrying is like a rocking chair, it gives you something to do, but it gets you nowhere.","As every new breed of virus is conceived, created and released into the wild, another small change is made to the anti-virus software to combat the new threat.","I met my wife in Bombay at an official function. And then we courted for three years. That's a great old term, 'courting.' And we had to do it quietly, of course, because you would know the difficulties one might have with Indian parents. She was advised by her father that people in the West don't take marriage seriously.","After all, just one virus on a computer is one too many.","There is one major problem with anti-virus software: It needs updating. Users cannot be relied upon to have even the anti-virus software in the first place, let alone be able or willing to pay for the updates.","During my years of professional cricket in England, I realised that although the Australians were talented players, tactically they were a bit naive when compared to those who played full-time on the English circuit. You might find this arrogant, but that was the reality then.","As a kid in New Zealand, you play cricket in summer and rugby in winter. I played cricket and hockey. Not rugby. I wasn't brawny enough for it. Or silly enough, perhaps.","I would love to play cricket today, with all - I am not just talking of money - the opportunity you get, the practice facilities, the amount of time you are able to put into preparation.","You can get too close as a team. You need time away from each other. You change in the same dressing room, you play on the same cricket field, you stay in the same hotel, you travel in the same planes and buses. C'mon - this business of everyone holding hands and being pally is nonsense.","I think all versions of limited-overs cricket have attracted more people to the game.","Personally, I've never done things just for money.","I believe in greater self-sufficiency. International sport is tough, no doubt, but there shouldn't be too many crutches. In most cases sports psychologists are crutches, and they tend to soften rather than harden the players.","I keep trying to bring a more professional approach to New Zealand cricket. It's an uphill battle. I stay in the game because I find it intriguing and interesting. I'm not interested in coaching international sides. I don't mind short-term coaching. I don't want to get involved in the politics of teams."],"Glenne Headly":["To me, a lot of what makes a good actor is not what a teacher tells you to do but how you respond when you're on your own.","I think a lot of good actors - for instance, Gary Sinise - have no training. His training was really entirely on his feet. I suppose you have to have an instinct for it.","I had gone to the High School of the Performing Arts in New York City.","Scene study is isolated. I suppose it's interesting, but I don't think it really teaches you about a throughline. A throughline is something you feel when you do one scene followed by another followed by another.","I hope people think about the way trials go today, with the justice system overwhelmed by cases.","We are not living up to Thomas Jefferson's idea of what a trial by jury means.","When I left high school - I was younger than my classmates, just 17 - I knew I wanted to be an actress, but I thought, 'When I go to college, I'd rather study something else.'","Theatre requires devotion that is all-consuming. When we started out, we didn't mind working 12 hours a day. We didn't mind going endlessly over and over a scene to make it right. I was the company's costumer for the first few years, and I remember the budget for 'Balm in Gilead' was $150.","Once we were a part of Equity, we were able to get a salary, and then because we were employing ourselves, we just made sure we were always working. We put in hours to get subscribers. We used to do little shows at rich peoples' houses to get them to give us money.","Rhythm and timing are so important in comedic acting.","I went to the library and found lots of material about this time, about the Freedom March and what was going on down there in 1964.","My son is 14, and I only have this time with him. True, it's not like before when I couldn't explain to a little boy why I can't read him his bedtime story six nights a week. And he's even said to me, 'Mom, if you want to do a show somewhere, you should go.'","I was shocked when I would read a newspaper from that time, and the Freedom March wasn't even mentioned."],"Glennon Doyle Melton":["If no pain, then no love. If no darkness, no light. If no risk, then no reward. It's all or nothing. In this damn world, it's all or nothing.","I think of love and marriage in the same way I do plants: We have perennials and annuals. The perennial plant blooms, goes away, and comes back. The annual blooms for just a season, and then winter arrives and takes it out for good. But it's still enriched the soil for the next flower to bloom. In the same way, no love is wasted.","We need to make friends with ourselves. We are stuck with our self all day, so let's be kinder, gentler, more amusing company. Let's take our own hand and say, 'There, there, sister. You're doing a good job. I'm proud of how you're handling all this craziness down here. Don't give up. Carry on, warrior.'","I'm nothing if not a tangled, colorful ball of contradictions.","I just think that if we are going to call ourselves pro-life, we must also agree that starvation and poverty and disease and immigration and health care for all and war and peace and the environment are also pro-life issues.","I can't even carpe 15 minutes in a row. So a whole diem is out of the question.","It makes no sense to me that my gay friends cannot get married to each other because a certain slice of Christianity doesn't believe in gay marriage.","Making sensible family rules around cell phones and driving is a way to love yourself, your marriage, your children, and the world well.","We all have this misunderstanding about heartbreak, which is we think we should avoid it. But what I think is that heartache is a clue toward the work we're supposed to be doing in the world. What breaks each person's heart is different - be it racial injustice, war, or animals. And when you figure out what it is that breaks yours, go toward it.","I know how I like my house. I like it cute and cozy and a little funky, and I like it to feel lived in and worn, and I like the things inside of it to work. That's all. And for me, it's fine that my house's interior suggests that I might not spend every waking moment thinking about how it looks.","The amazing thing about love and attention and encouragement and grace and success and joy is that these things are infinite. We get a new supply every single morning, and so we can give it away all day. We never, ever have to monitor the supply of others or grab or hoard.","If you're not okay, you might as well not pretend you are, especially since life has a way of holding us down until we utter that magic word: help! That's when angels rush to your side.","When people express opinions that differ from yours, take it as a chance to grow. Seek to understand over being understood. Be curious, not defensive. The only way to disarm another human being is by listening.","I ask only child-free pals for parenting advice because they're the only ones sane and well-rested enough to have any real insight.","Many of us spend the first part of our adult lives becoming - stepping into the roles we take on so that they come to define our lives. But I've learned that we don't really grow up until we unbecome.","Young people: marry simply, start your life, and party later. Think of how much babysitting for your future colicky baby you could buy with that wedding budget. Think of how much marriage therapy you could buy. Invest in your marriage, not your wedding.","We're told that to be successful girls, we have to be small and quiet. Yet to be successful humans, we have to become big and have a voice. There's an inherent contradiction.","If you ask a woman who she is, she'll tell you who she serves and sometimes what she does. But that isn't the whole story.","Pain is mandatory for all of us. It's what teaches us. Suffering is what's optional. That's what happens when we try to skip over the pain.","I've never believed in or understood romantic love. Love at first sight was always a complete joke to me.","I realized I didn't just want to parent children in my own little home but to mother the whole world. What's the point of gaining influence if you're not going to use it?","We'll tell fear it can come along with us in our minivan, okay? But we'll just tell fear it can't drive. Sometimes we'll tell it to not even talk. Like when we tell our kids, 'Enough. No words.' We're going to play the quiet game with fear. Fear is not the boss of us.","I hated writing 'Love Warrior.' It's the hardest thing I've every written. I cried.","Love is kind, right? It's not about calling someone out on every little thing you feel.","It blows my mind when I actually consider that men are as human as I am. How can you possibly be as human and have all of the thoughts and feelings that I have and never be able to talk about it, ever? Guys are in desperate need of truth telling. They are in desperate need of a revolution.","I wrote in my first book that I was broken, and now it just makes me mad every time. This is why writing words in books is so precarious. This is why Jesus only wrote in the sand, right? I just - I hate that I wrote that.","I don't think that I'm broken at all. I no longer think that I'm a mess. I just think I'm a deeply feeling person in a messy world.","You need to remember that being rejected by church is not the same as being rejected by God. God did not kick you out of church, honey. The church kicked God out of church.","When folks decide they love any institution more than the individual souls inside them, they're missing the mark.","Sometimes when you love someone like a mother loves her child, that love can turn into fear. It happens to me all the time. I am so afraid that the world will not be kind to my children.","One day we will finally see that when we reject any person or group of people, we reject a part of our very selves. All are one. All are in. All are God's beloved children with a place at the table.","I'm not big on faith rules, but if I had to choose one, it would be that every person must choose a faith issue upon which to hang her hat that requires her to change - not somebody else.","We should live out our particular brand of faith, sure - but we should never force our brand of faith upon anyone else. All violence starts with the desire to change others and then never, ever ends.","I believe in people because I believe in God. I think God knew what God was doing when God made each of us.","Often, we need to ignore the words people say and attend to their underlying, urgent, life or death questions: Am I valuable? Am I loved? The great thing is that the answer is easy: Yes! The answer is always yes. We don't have to think too hard.","Over time, I have come to believe that 'brave' does not mean what we think it does. It does not mean 'being afraid and doing it anyway.' Nope. Brave means listening to the still small voice inside and doing as it says. Regardless of what the rest of the world is saying.","'Brave' is very specific and extremely personal. It can't be judged by people on the outside. Just can't. Sometimes brave means letting everyone else think you're a coward. Sometimes brave is letting everyone else down but yourself.","I am not bound to spend my precious days on Earth trying to keep up with the Joneses - because the Joneses are really just a bunch of folks in conference rooms changing 'trends' rapidly to create fake monthly emergencies for us.","It is suggested to us a million times a day that our bodies are projects. They aren't. Our lives are. Our spirituality is. Our relationships are. Our work is.","Your body is not your art - it's your paintbrush. Whether your paintbrush is a tall paintbrush or a thin paintbrush or a stocky paintbrush or a scratched up paintbrush is completely irrelevant.","Compassion does not just happen. Pity does, but compassion is not pity. It's not a feeling. Compassion is a viewpoint, a way of life, a perspective, a habit that becomes a discipline - and more than anything else, compassion is a choice we make that love is more important than comfort or convenience.","Habits are learned. And children learn their habits by watching what we do, not by listening to what we say. So we have to stop talking and teaching and preaching and just go do.","The most important thing on Earth is for all of us to make this sentence true: Compassion is what people do.","I used to choose friends based on similarity in age and life stage, but I've learned that those were the wrong criteria. Trying to live life exclusively alongside others our own age is like attempting to climb Mt. Everest without a Sherpa. It's a little dangerous.","Questions are like gifts - it's the thought behind them that the receiver really feels. We have to know the receiver to give the right gift and to ask the right question. Generic gifts and questions are all right, but personal gifts and questions feel better.","Life is a conversation. Make it a good one.","The truth is that cleaning up socks and trying to get someone to really listen to you is marriage. It's less sweep you off your feet and more sweep the kitchen four times a day. Like everything good in life, it's 98% back-breaking work and 2% moments that make the work worthwhile.","We are all trained by Disney to believe that the wedding is the finish line, but the wedding is just another starting line. In light of this fact, we should quit the huge, fancy, debt-inducing weddings.","Do not measure your marriage by how much love you feel today: measure it by how much love you've offered today.","I snap at people I love all the time, and that makes me feel bad about myself. I want to be Zen. I am so not Zen. Whatever Zen is, I'm the opposite of it.","If we are going to ask for our daily bread, we've got to take the time to receive it and eat it. God provide, but we've got to slow down long enough to taste and see.","Christianity asserts that God made himself human. Those are two different categories - two different levels of worthiness. God is one category, and human is another. That's a downgrade. After that jump, there are no more categories - no more downgrades. There are no human levels of worthiness. There is no hierarchy in God's eyes.","We are - each and every one of us - unlearning misogyny. It's going to take some time. But be aware and active of your prejudices. Notice when they kick in and resist. Fight to stay soft and open. Step back and squint hard.","If grace isn't shocking and countercultural and scandalous and a little ridiculous, then it's not Grace.","The Internet has become my enabler. It keeps me from stillness and discomfort, and this keeps me from growing.","The hardest part of living without social media was remembering that my little life was enough, so I could just stay there and live it without asking for anyone else's permission or validation. I realized that for me, posting is like asking the world, 'Do you 'like' me?'","When I was detoxing from social media, I realized that I was thinking in status updates. It seemed I had trained my brain to translate everything I experienced throughout the day into 140 characters or less.","Parenting is the most important thing to many of us, and so it's also the place we're most vulnerable. We're all a little afraid we're doing it wrong.","When in doubt, I choose love above any particular ideas offered to me about faith.","You do not have to agree with me to love me.","Being a mother is a little like 'Groundhog's Day.' It's getting out of bed and doing the exact same things again and again and yet again - and it's watching it all get undone again and again and yet again. It's humbling, monotonous, mind-numbing, and solitary.","I think that in order to parent effectively, we are going to have to admit two things: We can't keep our children safe. We can't accept the fact that we can't keep our children safe.","Sometimes the rewards of risk don't leave us wrecked. Sometimes we find our passion, our purpose, courage, connection, and comfort. Every good thing in our lives is a direct result of risk.","A safe life includes following your dreams with the full knowledge that doing so is not, in any way, shape or form, safe in the traditional meaning of the word. Because living safely means dying without too many regrets. That is safe.","One of the reasons we stay so alone in our lives is because we're ashamed to talk about the hard stuff. It's as simple as that. We're all in pain in different ways, and we don't get the help we need because we're too ashamed to talk about the pain.","Book tours are super hard for me as a raging introvert. I love humanity, but actual humans are hard for me. So something like a book tour - where I'm constantly on the road - scares the hell out of me.","The closer you get to people who are different than you, the more you learn that we're all same.","I've seen my name on marquees and bowed to standing ovations. I've also been called a fraud, a mental case, a heretic. People all over the country wait in line to hug me or curse me.","We can be shiny and perfect and admired, or we can be real and honest and vulnerable and loved. But we actually do have to choose.","You can be shattered, and then you can put yourself back together piece by piece. But what can happen over time is this: You wake up one day and realize that you have put yourself back together completely differently. That you are whole, finally, and strong - but you are now a different shape, a different size.","We'd better not speak against misogyny if, in the same breath, we're not also speaking against transphobia and homophobia and racism and classism and poverty. This is one fight. It always has been.","Rock bottom is a crisis... and everyone wants to avoid crisis. But what 'crisis' means literally is 'to sift' - like a child who goes to the beach, lifts up the sand, and watches all the sand fall away, hoping that there's treasure left over. That's what crisis does.","Nothing separates a woman or a family from God's love. Not death, and certainly not divorce.","I don't want to take anything to the grave. I want to die used up and emptied out. I don't want to carry around anything I don't have to. I want to travel light.","To me, full-time mothering felt like way too much and yet not nearly enough. Lost in a landslide of diapers, birthday parties, and others' needs, I ached to reestablish myself.","The Internet is neither good nor bad. It's neutral - it becomes for each of us exactly what we bring to it.","Integrity means there is not a real-life you and an internet you. The two are one and the same. If you're not kind on the Internet, you're not kind.","My greatest fear is that I'll fail my kids.","Life is not safe, and so our task is not to promise our kids there will be no turbulence. It's to assure them that when the turbulence comes, we will all hold hands and get through it together.","When we shrug and say we don't care, it's usually a lie. Every girl cares. We've just been taught not to expose ourselves by showing it. What the world needs now is girls and women who aren't afraid to care - who are done saying, 'Whatever.'","The fact that we define ourselves by our roles can be an admirable thing - it's how we build a life and make a living. But it's also precarious. Roles change. Sometimes overnight.","I am not, at the end of the day, a mother, a wife, a writer, an activist, a friend. I am a child of God. That's who I was when I came into this world and who I'll be when I leave it. No one can take that from me."],"GloZell":["Now my haters are very high class people, so I feel like I've moved up.","Parenting is not giving your child everything they want. Parenting is not being your child's friend. Parenting is about preparing your child to be a useful and respectful person in society.","Voting is super important, and your vote counts.","If your knowledge is in your hands and in your mind, then nobody can take it away from you. Be kind and be on time! You never know who you're talking to - the waitress today could be the producer tomorrow, so it pays to be kind to everyone.","Parents today are self-absorbed. They don't care what anyone thinks or even what their children think. There is less focus on discipline, integrity, boundaries, fairness, honesty and spirituality.","Appreciate your body now. One day, you'll look back and regret all the time you wasted worrying about not looking perfect, because you were perfect the whole time.","There will be another book, more stories, more life experiences, so I'm ready; bring it on!","My childhood ambition was to become a Tooth Fairy. And I do talk about that in my book 'Is You Okay.' My mama always told me to say I wanted to be a corporate lawyer, and today I am much closer to being a Tooth Fairy than I ever was a Corporate Lawyer... so hah hah hah hah.","I actually started my YouTube channel by accident! I was growing a fan base without even knowing it, and it's all in my book 'Is You Okay?'","Security doesn't know who us YouTubers are, but they know who Justin Bieber is.","Those that don't know that I've gone through so many IVF treatments, and I've gone through six cycles to get this child, that's on its way via surrogate, biological child - and it's been great.","So many times I should've stopped or could've stopped and didn't stop... So many kinds of people can get depressed and sad, and you know what? Everyone has that talent, that gift.","My guilty pleasure is vanilla cupcakes! I love cupcakes! I love cupcakes. When it's really bad, it's 12 per day. I've fallen asleep with cupcake in my mouth, like, frosting all over my mouth. More than - several times.","I love 'Sky Whale!' I play it in bed, I play it in church, I even play it on the toilet!","I always wanted to be on 'Sesame Street,' that kind of a thing, puppets and fun and original songs and fairy tales.","My momma says whenever you go to somebody's house, you have to give them something. Don't come empty-handed.","Your ideas and the things that you do are dumb and stupid and make no sense - until you start getting recognized and making money. Then you're a genius.","My weave fell off. I was running in PE, and it got caught in a tree. People were looking at me funny.","Sometimes online, there are what we call trolls or bullies that want to leave negative comments. That's just because they feel bad about themselves, and they want to spread that.","Please take the time to leave something kind, or don't leave it at all. You know? That's an option, also.","Hello this is Glozell! Is you OK? Is you? Good, cause I wanted to know!","Moms are always looking for content that's clean and fun - and that you don't mind watching over and over.","My mom is floored! She's so proud. I always wanted to do a channel that incorporates songs for younger kids.","I'm usually - I'm working by myself.","Kids do their own thing. We let them be real kids. You get an immediate response - if they don't like the music, they don't do it.","I'm doing it. I'm going to become a mom.","The surrogate is feeling pregnant! And a little sick. She thinks it's a girl.","My community grew on social media because I don't exclude anybody from any walk of life. The videos that I create are seen throughout the world and are funny no matter what language you speak.","I stand out because I'm usually the first to create a trend or make an existing trend unique in my own way. Plus I look and sound different then most people on the Internet and have the most recognizable lips in cyberspace.","My biggest challenges when I first started out were not having a computer or camera or Wi-Fi! The computer and the camera had to be borrowed, and there were times that I used the computer at the library, and I literally sat outside people's houses to steal their Internet connections.","Someone is always taking a video of me or snapping a photo.","She is always going to be Diana Ross; she doesn't have to put out another album to keep at it. I'm not Diana, but people know me from the stuff that I've done. And that stuff, those videos, live forever and will continue to be discovered by a new users.","I only started uploading on YouTube because I was having trouble one day uploading a video on my blog.","I'm excited. I'm nervous. I'm having a girl! Baby weaves and green lipstick, here we come!","Everyone told me to sleep when the baby sleeps, but she sleeps during the daytime, and that's when I have to get stuff done! I've been a zombie.","I've learned how to exist and get work done when you're exhausted. I've finally gotten to that level, because at first I had no idea how I was going to do it.","Sometimes she wants her pacifier, and other times, she doesn't even want it near her. She's very strong and determined. She's always trying to stand, and she was born with her eyes open, so she's ready to go.","I love to make people laugh, and I believe that laughter and song are the best way to help young children learn.","I'm really excited about working with Bunim/Murray and PB&J to unleash the power of 'GloBugz' on the universe.","Everything isn't just gonna be okay. It doesn't just have to be good.","Learn how to make your own weaves. It will help you save a lot of money in the long run!","Exercise! It's important for your health. And just remember that what you see on Instagram isn't reality.","Learn to cook. The way to someone's heart is through their stomach, whether for a friend or a significant other.","I'm so thankful that there are people willing to do that - to actually carry a child nine months for someone.","I feel like I'm going to be like the ghetto 'Gilmore Girls' because I feel like this child is going to be more mature than I am because just look at me!","A lot of people have been asking me questions about IVF and surrogacy, and I'm glad that I can be a mouthpiece to that.","I'm bringing reading back. I'm making reading great again!","There are so many great YouTubers who might have a hit, but they come and they go. Maintaining and being here, just being able to relate to what's going on and putting my spin on the world, I bring not my age, but my my wisdom, and that's something some of the younger ones can't contribute.","Let's see... Rihanna! Work, work, work, work, work, work; OK, what? How much work does it take to move your behind, honey? I don't understand the job situation you're going through.","I do believe that O'Zell needs a sibling. She needs to have someone to play with.","My mom told me, 'Make sure you do everything you want to do before you have kids.' So that's what I was doing. But biologically, the body is just like, 'Well, you should have done it.'","You know, 'You should have frozen your eggs at 20.' Well, who's thinking about that at 20?","It took three years from talking about it, to meeting with Wendie Wilson-Miller from 'Gifted Journeys' Surrogacy, to finding the right doctor, to doing the egg retrieval and finding the right surrogate.","It can get discouraging - 'Oh, it didn't work,' or, 'Oh, I lost the baby,' or, 'I can't do this again.' You can. And when you get the kid, you'll be happy that you did. But it's a very painful process for a lot of people. You just have to figure out how it's gonna get done.","I thought I was healthy... well, my eggs were a little powdered.","It'd be nice if people consider me somewhat of an ambassador.","I don't understand if it was, like, Palestinians were here, then it was called Israel, and that's the problem, or they never had their land. Everyone just goes back and forth. So it seems like everyone can just have a piece... call the whole thing something else.","I get it that the media is going to show the worst part, because that's the part that people want to see. But they have not represented Israel or Palestine, however people want to call it, they haven't represented it well at all. Go to the beach! You won't know this place from California.","When I met Mrs. Clinton, I met the mom that she is, I met the daughter that she is, I met the grandma that she is.","Rebecca Black 'Friday' song is the best song ever! Don't you agree!","The Kesha Lyrics to hit song 'Tik Tok' are a cry for help.","I grew up in Florida, and I have a lot of friends, close friends, who are Cuban-Americans, and I have heard the stories of their families escaping, and some of them didn't even make it to come to the United States for a better life to get away from the Castros.","A very long time, I've wanted to be a mom. When we started this, we didn't know how it was going to end up.","I'm thinking that a boy would just be easier to take care of, you know? You don't have to worry about the weaves and the lipsticks and that kinda stuff.","Somehow, this child is gonna show me what to do, because I thought maybe I'll grow up by then, but no. I still just want to play around in my Crocs and tutus, so I don't know.","Obviously, I'm going to be embarrassing to the kid. There's just no way not. I just hope the kid has a really good sense of humor... My husband's very serious - he doesn't find me funny at all - so I'm hoping the kid is like, 'Mom is hilarious!' That'd be really great.","Most doctors want to keep their success rates high, so they'd rather deal with someone who is younger, who has healthier eggs and more of them.","My parenting heroes are the Obamas! They've been married for so long, and it looks like they're having fun, and their kids are down to earth, well-adjusted, and smart. They seem to have a strong family unit that I would like to emulate in my life.","My goal is to keep the child alive. Once she starts talking, I'll listen, but I know that I'll need to join some mommy groups and ask people for help.","My background is musical theater. I have a BFA from the University of Florida.","I want to be, like, a fertility minister. Like, someone who takes you by the hand and tells you that it'll be OK.","I'm known for being silly and fun and lighthearted.","Whether you're old or young or white or black or however, funny is funny, and people want to see those videos.","I was watching TV, and there was a girl acting a fool. And I was like, 'I could do that.'","I comment on my friends' things; whatever they post, I post funny posts. I don't post anything that's too sad or mad, or at least not for too long. And I'm usually just a happy person! Silly - people would describe me as silly and crazy and fun.","If I had to go back to something, I would go back to the 'Victory Tour' of the Jacksons, because I love me some Michael Jackson. I'd get my one glove, and my high water pants on, and my sparkly socks and black loafers.","What I hear is that people think of me as their cousin or their sister or somebody they want to hang out with.","A lot of my comedy is physical, so you don't have to understand English to get that I'm choking to death on cinnamon or falling out of this tree or whatever.","This girl just kept staring at me, and I was like, 'What in the world is wrong with her?' That's when I knew, this YouTube thing is something.","Women have to do a lot of things. That's why I think Ms. Hillary is going to be an awesome president.","How can we bridge the gap between... African-American males and white cops?","Rob Lowe said something negative about me. I'm like, 'What? Thank you! I didn't even know that you knew who I was; now you do.' I appreciate it. You're still hot, so what do I care?","I have three family members who are in the law enforcement.","Computers shouldn't be parents, but they are. Please, spend time with your kids. If you don't want to, then I don't want to. It might hurt you to discipline your offspring, but it saves the child from being disciplined later by someone less forgiving. Like a criminal court judge. If you don't spank your child, someone else will.","Today's new age parenting guarantees you'll hear children screaming, whining, and begging for items and attention in an airplane, store or any other public place."],"Gloria Allred":["There are some people who still feel threatened by strong women. That's their problem. It's not mine.","People who are pierced should not be snickered at, should not become the object of ridicule, should not be singled out for special and uneven and unequal treatment. They should be respected just like everybody else.","Well, I like empowering my clients.","I'm not interested in dating. I like being with my own best friend, me. Certain women, particularly older women, cannot believe I like going to a social event by myself. But I do.","Male privilege and entitlement are dying a very painful death; no one gives up power without a struggle.","Because of my life experiences, I understand that I have an opportunity to help other women. I have the desire and the ability.","Women will no longer be silent when they suffer injustices against them.","I actually feel most relaxed when I'm working.","When I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania I had a baby in one arm, a diploma in the other and I didn't know where I was going in life.","The more I know about men the more I like dogs.","I could have had someone else take care of my child but I did it because that was my moral obligation and also it was a joy and I felt it was in the best interests of the child.","I'm not an elected official who puts a finger in the wind to see what the majority thinks; I represent women, whether they're popular or not.","I do believe that, under the law, under the Constitution of the United States, and under our public policy, that women deserve and should have a right to enjoy equal employment opportunity.","Fighting injustice keeps you young.","It is very frightening to feel alone when you are standing against a rich and powerful person and all his attendant helpers.","Eventually I figured out there was something systematic in the way women are treated.","I have known some wonderful men.","I was a single mother when my child was little.","I'm entitled to collect my fair share of community property without being called names.","I have two grandchildren.","There still is a war on women in terms of politicians in Washington and the state legislatures trying to eliminate any rights we have fought to win and that the Supreme Court has afforded us.","It's not my fault if the media and the public are more interested in Tiger Woods than in women farm workers.","There are endless new variations on how to hurt a woman physically, emotionally, financially, and socially.","Do feminists have a sense of humor? Yes.","I'm proud that my clients are working to support themselves and those who depend on them.","I have represented people in book deals.","I cannot take every case that people ask me to take.","I'm pretty tough.","I'm a civil rights attorney. I'm a victim rights attorney.","As my father would have said, I went through the college of hard knocks.","Well, let me just say - I mean, I'm not a person who's going to vote for any of the potential Republican nominees for the presidency of the United States.","I think there should be better child support laws to make it easier for those single moms to support their children so they don't have to go on welfare."],"Gloria Emerson":["I applied for a job at 'The New York Times' many years ago, and felt correctly that my life depended on it.","I didn't write to be famous; I wrote to keep a record.","The real victims of men are other men.","Korea taught me nothing, for no one spoke of it when I was growing up, except as something about how wonderful the girls in Japan were. Vietnam taught some of us more than we perhaps ever wished to know."],"Gloria Estefan":["My mom was a source of strength. She showed me by example that women, regardless of how difficult life may get, can do it all.","The sad truth is that opportunity doesn't knock twice.","Whatever it is your heart desires, please go for it, it's yours to have.","Motherhood is... difficult and... rewarding.","I'm very comfortable in my own skin now. I started just being myself more and more. For women, this happens as you get older. I loved my 40s - I thought they were fantastic. And I'm loving my 50s. I'm going to love everything because you're either older or dead!","The responsibility of carrying and bringing a new life into this world is one that cannot be taken lightly.","There are so many difficult things we're living through in the world today, so many horrible events, but we cannot let them stop us. No matter what happens, I feel you must move forward with optimism and not get totally sideswiped.","I'm careful what I put out there into the universe, musically. I don't take it lightly.","All I tell artists is, 'Do what you love. Never let anybody talk you into changing what your musical idea is just to try to get a hit, because you're chasing your tail that way. It's not going to happen, and if you're successful, you have to do it the rest of your life. Stay true to it and do it for the sake of the art.'","I don't want anything from Cuba. I want them to be free and enjoy the things I enjoy.","My mum had a very strong moral code, which I kind of came with. I never really had to be told what was right or wrong - I knew. I was very mature from early on and I was a very good girl, so she never had any trouble with me.","The Internet has been a blessing and a curse. The curse we know: A lot of people appropriating your intellectual property without paying for it. But I think it's important to realize the blessing of the Internet, which is that everybody has a voice and you can break through, even without a record company.","There are so many beautiful things that are a part of the world, and I've always looked at life that way; I've always tried to put on a smile and a brave front, not just for my kids but in my own life and all the difficulties that I've gone through.","I wrote poetry, which got me into lyrics. Stevie Wonder, Carole King, Elton John pulled me into pop. I started singing with a band - just for fun - when I was 17. And pretty soon, I was thinking I could sing pop in English as well as Spanish.","We protect aspirin bottles in this country better than we protect guns from accidents by children.","Having felt people's love and support first hand through difficult moments in my life makes me feel it's our responsibility to help one another.","I think that the only way to teach is by example, as children will more easily follow what they see you do than what you tell them to do.","In this life, I'm always going to choose the positive.","I hold 'Mi Tierra,' my first Spanish-language album, very close to me because that was all done in my native tongue and won me my first Grammy.","Fashion is nice, but it's for the fans. If it were up to me, I'd be in a sweat suit!","As an immigrant, I appreciate, far more than the average American, the liberties we have in this country. Silence is a big enemy of morality. I don't want our blunders in history to get repeated.","When you're a front man for a band, there's nowhere to hide. It took me a long time to get used to that. But music is my first love. I started singing when I talked.","In the United States, if you believe in yourself and you're determined and persevere, you're going to succeed.","My job as an entertainer is to take you some place else. I love exploring different genres of music to please my fans.","I have great genes. Thank you to my mom and dad for that one.","When I was a teenager, I was fat. I was shy. I wore glasses. I had a big eyebrow and hair all over my body. They were years of torture.","I think we should all live the moment. But you also have to think ahead. You have to think, 'Am I going to be happy with this five, ten years from now? Is it going to let me evolve and grow, or am I going to grow to one day wish I had never done it?' Sometimes you just have to think a little bit ahead.","I've been offered a lot of things that celebrities do that I wouldn't do, like perfumes, lines of clothing and this, that and the other.","I'm a writer and this is what I love to do.","There's no reason that just because you're a celebrity you can't write.","You've got to believe. Never be afraid to dream.","You can put things off until tomorrow but tomorrow may never come.","We seal our fate with the choices we take, but don't give a second thought to the chances we take.","My mom was definitely very strict with me.","Sometimes my mother had difficulty communicating with me about certain topics.","Sex and drugs were simply not discussed in our culture at that time.","I have a very open line of communication with both my children.","There are certain realities we must speak of with our children that were not present when I was a child.","My mother had a beautiful, soothing voice that made me melt.","To know that everything we say and do to this new little human being may have a profound effect on him or her is a daunting obligation.","Being Latin parents makes us extremely expressive with our affections.","As an artist, you dream about accumulating enough successful music to someday do just one greatest-hits album, but to reach the point where you're releasing your second collection of hits is beyond belief.","Nothing ever stays in the middle. You always go from one extreme to the other, and politics is certainly that way.","The '70s were a hot time. You know? I was, like, the most calm of all my friends.","I'd love to have a program like 'Dr. Laura.' I studied psychology at the University of Miami, and when I rode the bus home from school, perfect strangers would strike up conversations with me and end up telling me their life stories. I think they could sense that I was studying to help people. That, or I have a face like a priest.","A lot of the way I sing is playing off other musicians. It's what I love to do the most.","When most artists walk offstage, they go to a lonely hotel room. I went home to my family. They were there before the show, during and after. It's been great. I never would have done it any other way. I wasn't gonna miss raising my kids. There was no way that was gonna happen.","I gotta tell you, my nature is not to be the center of attention.","If there's ever been a dark moment in my life... well, I wanted to check out. Music was a big escape.","My mom was an amazing singer and music was a big part of my life, so I grew up listening to Nat King Cole, Johnny Mathis, Henry Mancini; I used to watch 'The Andy Williams Show' on TV. I was very musical, so I was watching stuff that most kids my age wouldn't be interested in.","I love Gershwin. I love musicals.","My inspirations include the Beatles - love, love, love them - Elton John, Carole King, and Stevie Wonder.","What's the point if you make something that's not you, and you're successful? You have to perform it the rest of your life.","My family was musical on both sides. My father's family had a famous flautist and a classical pianist. My mother won a contest to be Shirley Temple's double - she was the diva of the family. At 8, I learned how to play guitar. I used to play songs from the '20s, '30s and '40s in the kitchen for my grandmother.","The reason I'm not more political is because I have music. And from a young age, I needed it. After prison, my father came to America, joined the Army, fought in Vietnam - and was exposed to Agent Orange. He died a slow, horrible death. Music was my escape.","Apparently Pope John Paul II and his boys - is that what you call them? - loved one of my songs and thought I was putting spiritual messages in my music. I'm not religious as such. Dogma and I don't get along.","Music is almost mystical to me. It really has an incredibly powerful force.","I know that people think of me in terms of Latin music and that's wonderful, that's my heritage, that's who I am, but there's so much more to me and my music.","You know, it's funny how songs continue to grow and evolve and become a new and deeper reflection of your life.","I wanted very badly to be a mum. I'm a very maternal person. But at the point that I met Emilio I was focusing on a career. I never would have thought that I would get married at 21 and much less be a mum by 23.","Family has always been the number one priority no matter what happens anywhere else.","Once you know the Romance languages, singing in those languages is so sexy and sensual. I do have a global audience, so why not?","I was going to be a doctor, but I think my music allowed me to help more people than I could have done one-on-one as a psychologist. Just like other people's music really helped me.","As an entertainer, my job is to help people have fun.","I spent 15 years on the road between touring and recording and I never saw anything. I want to enjoy life.","Music has been so healing in my life, so the fact that my music could be that for someone else is the best gift of my whole career. People have told me that they got married to my music, divorced to my music, and played my music while they were having their baby.","Touring is hard. It's really hard on the singer, especially, because your body is your instrument and you have to be so good, it's like boot camp out there; I can't do anything - just sleep, sing and be very healthy.","Everything that an artist does is a risk. Some people want you to stay the same. If you want to evolve, they want to keep you in a certain place.","People tend to forget that celebrities are human beings. We live our lives. We try to do what we love, which is music. And to share it with everyone in our job usually is to entertain and to make people forget their troubles.","You want your fans to like what you do, because it's coming from your heart and soul. You write it, you produce this thing. It's like your baby."],"Gloria Gaither":["God's will for your life is God's will for today, and it doesn't get any more glamorous than that.","Everything is a part of what God's up to in your life, so I think our job is to embrace it. Everything. Embrace it all and consider it God's will for this moment.","The more I come to recognize my story's place in God's grander Story, my once-bewildered questions are turning to psalms of thanksgiving at the wonder that I have been included in what He is doing.","Scripture has always been a part of my life. My dad was a pastor. My mother was a speaker, writer, and teacher. I memorized Scripture from the time I was little.","In working with people across the country and around the world, I've come to know that most of us go through times that re-route our prayer life.","I never set out to write prayers at all. But there was a span of time when I didn't find it easy to pray, but, when I went to write one of the things I had to write, a prayer would come.","When we're in trouble, it's usually a line from a song that saves us. I wish it was sermons, but, I'm sorry, it's not. When you're in crisis, what comes to mind is 'O love that would not let me go.' You know?","I grew up in a literary home and majored in French, English, and sociology. They all have served me well over the years."],"Gloria Gaynor":["I had a fear of being alone.","There's nothing to compare to live music, there just isn't anything.","That's why you find a lot of entertainers are insecure, because it's the perfect camouflage for insecurity.","Well, we all know that self-esteem comes from what you think of you, not what other people think of you.","People always want to ask me about my drug problem - I never had a drug problem; I had a self-esteem problem!","Well, I went through some emotionally abusive relationships and allowed myself to not be properly respected as a lady, as a human being even, though I tried everything I knew to be a lady.","I have never been a different person onstage than I am off.","I think I sound like Barry White.","My look is always glitzy for New Year's Eve, even if I am at home.","A chic guy is in a suit. I don't care what kind of tie they wear. I don't care if they even wear a tie, as long as they can carry a suit.","Well, for street clothes, a lot of what I wear is Jones New York. I am well-endowed in the derriere, and they can handle that.","One of the high points of my career was winning the Grammy for 'I Will Survive.'","I still love a variety of kinds of music.","The better your audience, the more energy you have, and the more energy you have, the better show you do. The better show you do, the more they love it, and the more energy they give back to you.","When I'm on stage, all is right with the world.","All through my young life I wanted to sing, although nobody in my family knew it.","God allows circumstances to build us up. God has got our back.","I had cars, houses, jewels, furs, and a husband who loved me, and a career I was happy with. But I found fulfillment in my relationship with Christ.","Christ does not fulfill the human element, but he certainly fulfills every other need in your life. As far as I'm concerned, there's no better love affair.","People are intimidated when they first meet me, but it doesn't take them long to realise I'm just an average person.","I will always try to share my faith with any person who is willing to listen. When I feel a wall go up, we can talk about something else... and I will pray for you."],"Gloria Grahame":["It wasn't the way I looked at a man, it was the thought behind it.","You go through life in a series of peaks and valleys.","There's always a race against time. I don't think for one moment that life gets better. How can it? One's body starts to fall apart.","I remember everything, even the dates. But I don't want others to remember the details, just the image.","I don't think I ever understood Hollywood."],"Gloria Guinness":["I love to look at women with good bones and good bodies in good clothes.","I've never worn costume jewelry in my life. It's really very self-defeating. Why should a man buy a woman real jewelry when she wears false pieces?","I think everyone envisions me sitting at Alexandre's all day, picking out beautiful clothes from passing couturiers."],"Gloria Macapagal Arroyo":["The power of one, if fearless and focused, is formidable, but the power of many working together is better.","We have to be bold in our national ambitions. First, we must win the fight against poverty within the next decade. Second, we must improve moral standards in government and society to provide a strong foundation for good governance. Third, we must change the character of our politics to promote fertile ground for reforms.","We must promote solid traits such as work ethics, a dignified lifestyle, matching actions to rhetoric, performance rather than grandstanding.","We must weed out corruption and build a strong system of justice that the people can trust.","Even before 9/11, the Philippines was already fighting terrorism in southwestern Philippines. That's why when 9/11 happened, we could understand the pain.","Our children are our most cherished possession. In their early years, we must make sure they get a healthy start in life. They must receive the right food for a healthy body, the right education for a bright and inquiring mind - and the equal opportunity for a meaningful job.","I will not stand idly when anyone gets in the way of the national interest and tries to block the national vision. From where I sit, I can tell you, a president is always as strong as she wants to be.","I want ordinary people to enjoy a decent standard of living, with ever increasing security, comfort and joy.","As I have shown, I will defend democracy with arms when it is threatened by violence; with firmness when it is weakened by division; with law and order when it is subverted by anarchy; and always, I will try to sustain it by wise policies of economic progress so that a democracy means not just an empty liberty, but a full life for all.","The Philippines and the U.S. have had a strong relationship with each other for a very long time now. We have a shared history. We have shared values, democracy, freedom, and we have been in all the wars together in modern history, the World War, Second World War, Cold War, Vietnam, Korea, now the war on terrorism.","Agrarian reform should not merely subdivide misery, it must raise living standards. Ownership raises the farmer from his, but productivity will keep him on his feet.","I will follow my father's footsteps by doing what is right, and God will take care of the rest. My father is my role model. My living role model is Cory Aquino.","In 1995, we had evidence of the brother-in-law of Osama bin Laden being in the Philippines, living in the Philippines. We had evidence of front organizations set up in the Philippines. And we uncovered evidence about, which would help the U.S. with - about the perpetuators of the World Trade Center bombing.","The Philippines was with the U.S. in the Second World War, in the Korean War, in the Vietnam War, and now in the war against terrorism.","I am falsely accused, without proof, of using my position for personal profit. Many who accuse me have lifestyles and spending habits that make them walking proofs of that crime.","Filipino businessmen must have the ability to compete freely in the global economy.","We may disagree among ourselves, but let us never lose sight of that greater battle for one people, one country, one Philippines.","A president must be on the job 24/7, ready for any contingency, any crisis, anywhere, anytime.","The roof cannot collapse when the value pillars of government and society are sound and strong.","Our investments in social justice and basic needs are as vital to our future as fiscal and macroeconomic reforms. A nation deeply divided will not stand. And it certainly will not move forward.","College education is the great Filipino dream. But in a world of rapid technological change, getting a job or keeping it depends as much on how well one reasons as how well one uses his hands.","I sow; my successor reaps. This is the majesty of democracy.","I want justice to be so pervasive that it will be taken for granted, just as injustice is taken for granted today.","In the time one is given, the steward must make the most of the talents one is given by the Lord.","Now I ask you to make your sacrifice. Take a gamble. I took the plunge and I'm glad of it.","We have the hardest working people in the world, the most adaptable and the most congenial to employ.","I'm not worried. I'm in control.","It is simply the truth that the political system that I am part of has degenerated to the point that it needs fundamental change.","While there's been much progress on terrorism, there's still much work to do and it is very important that the countries work together in order to address this threat together.","I can say that I have not done any culpable violation of the constitution.","In all the things I've gone through as a politician, I have seen that in this system it is really very difficult to make any headway without being somehow tainted. And let me say, 'Let him who is without sin cast the first stone.'","The military is very constitutionalist, and I have my faith in them and in the cooler heads of the people.","It is the civilian part of the politics that is very, very bad, and we have to change that.","On the economy, the U.S. cumulatively is our most important investor, most important trading partner, most important sort of tourists, and we have now a tie that will... a link that will be here for many, many years to come, and that is the big Philippine-American community in the United States - three million of them.","I am very grateful to our Muslim population. One of the things we've been doing is stepping up our inter-faith dialogue with the Muslim population. And I think that helped very much in their support for me.","We've supported the U.S. every step of the way. The Philippines was the first government in Asia after September 11, in fact, the night of September 11; it was nighttime for us then. It was daytime here. We were the first government in Asia to come out and say that we're supporting the U.S.","In a global arena, what our businessmen need in order to be competitive is transparency and a level playing-field.","Our political system needs changing. It needs to move away from personalities and patronage to a system of party programs and consultation with the people.","The military is faithful to the constitution. They will come in only to protect the people from the enemies of the state.","The Constitution says that troops can be in the Philippines if there's a treaty that provides for it, and we have two treaties with the United States.","I believe that the war against terrorism and the war against poverty in these times of turmoil go together. So you - when you fight one, you have to fight the other.","I follow my father's philosphy; 'Do what is good, do what is right, and God will take care of the rest.'","The contracts for Iraqi rebuilding are commercial contracts. I think being in the coalition of the willing puts us in the radar screen, but we also have to compete with other countries that are in the coalition of the willing, but the Philippines is a country that has produced world-class skilled workers that we have seen all over the world.","I feel that if I am freed of the burden of politics, then I can do more and I can take more unpopular decisions. I can have as my guidance for decision whatever is right, not whatever is popular.","We look at the world and analyze the world, and see what we can do that is in line of our mutual interest and also in line with, you know, what the whole world needs, because this is a world where we really have to all work together.","We have our own home-grown terrorism, and to the extent that we can obliterate terrorism all over the world, then our own terrorism will be much easier to neutralize.","You have 60 countries in the world with a terrorist problem. That's two-thirds of the world. We have this group in Basilan, which is a small island in the far south of the Philippines, and the island itself has a population of - what? - 300,000.","In my presidency I've been guided by what's right, not what's popular.","I know the pain of having to deal with terrorism. And that's why, after 9-11, I was one of the first to join the international coalition to fight terrorism.","The Iraqi regime was supporting terrorist cells all over the world. We had to expel three Iraqi diplomats from the Philippines because of evidence that they were either in touch with Abu Sayyaf or doing their own espionage.","I was invited by President Bush to come to the United States on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the mutual defense treaty.","I was at Ground Zero, and it was, to me, such a graphic illustration of what terrorism has done to our world.","We're working with our neighbors Indonesia and Malaysia to fight terrorism in our own common seas.","I feel that if I am freed of the burden of politics, then I can do more, and I can take more unpopular decisions.","It's never right to fight terror with terror.","I can't do everything alone. I need all Filipinos to unify.","My responsibility as president is to take care to solve the problems we are facing now and to provide a vision and direction for how our nation should advance in the future.","As the leader of the nation, I say in behalf of the Filipino people to the world: we are strong and principled believers in democracy.","The Philippines has no policy that demands sacrifice of human lives.","I want to create economic opportunity at home and abroad. I don't want just one or the other. I want both.","Chronic deficits drastically reduce government's ability to make those infrastructure investments that business needs to grow and create jobs.","I ask the educational system, the parents, the church, and pillars of the community to help shape a new culture of honesty, patriotism, respect, discipline and service for young Filipinos.","We will downsize the government, motivate excess employees to become entrepreneurs, and increase the pay of a lean and mean bureaucracy.","Over the years, our political system has degenerated to the extent that it is difficult for anyone to make any headway yet keep his hands clean.","By and large, our political system has betrayed its promise to each new generation of Filipinos, not a few of whom are voting with their feet, going abroad and leaving that system behind.","I shall work with Congress, civil society groups and local government executives who are convinced that charter changes are needed to enable the country to surmount the unprecedented challenges of the 21st century.","In the area of national security, I urge the swift passage of an anti-terrorism law that will protect rather than subvert, enhance rather than weaken, the rights and liberties that terrorism precisely threatens with extinction.","The people want government that works for them at every level.","To our men and women in the armed services, the huge and deep core of your loyalty has earned the nation's accolade.","Central Philippines has the competitive edge in tourism in its natural wonders and the extraordinary hospitality of its people.","In the harshest possible terms, I condemn political killings.","Camiguin, Romblon and Camarines Norte got out of the list of poorest provinces in 2003. With tourism, these provinces can become rich.","We have scaled the heights of Mount Everest, dominated the Southeast Asian games, we have won international beauty titles, and of course punched our way to triumph in the boxing world. Our people compete and win every day in every imaginable job throughout the world.","For those who want to pick up old fights, we're game, but what a waste of time. Why not join hands instead? Join hands in the biggest challenge of all, where we all win, or we all lose: the battle for the survival and progress of our one and only country.","Individually, we've taken the world on and won; together, we must take on the challenge of creating a new, peaceful, humane and competitive nation and prevail.","Optimism is infectious, and opportunity irresistible. Progress follows progress. Someone, even government, just has to get it started.","The Philippines ranks among top off-shoring hubs in the world because of cost competitiveness and, more importantly, our highly trainable, English proficient, IT-enabled management and manpower.","We fight terrorism. It threatens our sovereign, democratic, compassionate and decent way of life.","I stand in the way of no one's ambition. I only ask that no one stand in the way of the people's well being and the nation's progress.","Nature did not gift us with a mighty Mekong like Thailand and Vietnam, with their vast and naturally fertile plains. Nature instead put our islands ahead of our neighbours in the path of typhoons from the Pacific.","Better talk than fight, if nothing of sovereign value is anyway lost. Dialogue has achieved more than confrontation in many parts of the world.","As your president, I care too much about this nation to let anyone stand in the way of our people's wellbeing.","I did not become president to be popular. To work, to lead, to protect and preserve our country, our people, that is why I became president.","Our educational system should make the Filipino fit not just for whatever jobs happen to be on offer today, but also for whatever economic challenge life will throw in their way.","As a country in the path of typhoons and in the Pacific Rim of Fire, we must be prepared as the latest technology permits to anticipate natural calamities when that is possible, to extend immediate and effective relief when it is not.","Real government is about looking beyond the vested to the national interest, setting up the necessary conditions to enable the next, more enabled and more empowered generation to achieve a country as prosperous, a people as content, as ours deserve to be.","However much a president wishes it, a national problem cannot be knocked out with a single punch. A president must work with the problem as much as against it, turn it into a solution if she can.","There isn't a day I do not work at my job, or a waking moment when I do not think through a work-related problem. Even my critics cannot begrudge the long hours I put in. Our people deserve a government that works just as hard as they do."],"Gloria Naylor":["I realize at one point, that I was being followed, and then I began to see the surveillance that was going past the road on my house.

People began to follow me around, and it did, it was very disrupting to think that your privacy was being violated, and for no reason that I could come up with.","Self-consciousness is really a form of egotism.","I wrote what I felt I had to write, and I'm willing to put my own sanity and my reputation behind it.","Old as she was, she still missed her daddy sometimes.","One should be able to return to the first sentence of a novel and find the resonances of the entire work.","I don't believe that life is supposed to make you feel good, or make you feel miserable either. Life is just supposed to make you feel.","Lord keep her safe since you can't keep her sane.","Life is accepting what is and working from that.","Not only is your story worth telling, but it can be told in words so painstakingly eloquent that it becomes a song.","Spoiled. That's all it's about - can't live without this, can't live without that. You can live without anything you weren't born with, and you can make it through on even half of that.","The intelligence community, for the most part, has no accountability at all; to the Congress, to us the American people, and so they feel that they above the law.","You can't teach talent. You can't put in what God left out - but you can teach confidence."],"Gloria Negrete McLeod":["I have chosen to seek election to the San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors and not reelection to Congress.","My federal, state, and local experience will allow me the opportunity to effectively represent the constituents of the Fourth District."],"Gloria Reuben":["A transition to clean energy is about making an investment in our future.","Clean energy is about offering people the opportunity to do what's right for themselves and the people they love. It's about reducing the pollution that makes people sick. It's about helping the low-income families struggling to pay their gas and electricity bills.","The destruction of the natural beauty, the ecosystems, and the majesty of mountains affect us in ways we're not even aware of. Every time a mountain is beheaded, we chop off a little part of our souls.","Corporations are poisoning our air and water while at the same time lining the pockets of elected officials with political contributions.","The main cause that I have attached my name to and am working diligently in is the issue of climate change.","The coal industry is a huge industry when we're talking about polluting the environment, our air and our waterways.","Our planet is warming due to pollution from human activities. And a warming climate increases the likelihood of extreme weather.","There's something about having a badge that just makes you feel so official.","It seems to me like Mother Nature's mercy and forgiveness have run dry, as we ceaselessly abuse her and take her for granted in order for us to continue our addiction to using fossil fuels. I've gotta say, I don't blame her. Not one bit.","How can we teach our children to be responsible beyond themselves and care for other human beings' welfare and for the welfare of the planet and all that it contains? It's a difficult lesson to convey, when, more than 20 years after the Exxon Valdez disaster, Prince William Sound is still experiencing the damaging effects.","I consider myself to be an international woman.","I had been an activist on the issue of HIV, primarily in the African American and Latino communities here in the U.S. for many years. It was horrifying to me how the pandemic was raging right here in this country but no one was talking about it.","Comprehensive climate legislation must be passed so that we can ensure a world where this and future generations can experience the bliss of breathing clean crisp air, while fishing in the Adirondacks... and being able to eat the fish afterwards.","Mountaintop removal coal operations enrich only a handful of elites while impoverishing everyone else in their proximity.","In my work as an actress and an activist, I've spent many years working with low income communities and people of color who don't always have a voice in our political process.","I was in L.A. during an earthquake in 1994, an experience that really stressed me out. I started doing yoga to calm my nerves.","I've always loved journaling as a way to clear my mind. Whether I'm traveling or at home, the first thing I do when I wake up is pull out my notebook and record positive things that have happened to me as well as uplifting thoughts."],"Gloria Steinem":["A gender-equal society would be one where the word 'gender' does not exist: where everyone can be themselves.","Every social justice movement that I know of has come out of people sitting in small groups, telling their life stories, and discovering that other people have shared similar experiences.","Being misunderstood by people whose opinions you value is absolutely the most painful.","Without leaps of imagination, or dreaming, we lose the excitement of possibilities. Dreaming, after all, is a form of planning.","A woman without a man is like a fish without a bicycle.","God may be in the details, but the goddess is in the questions. Once we begin to ask them, there's no turning back.","Feminism has never been about getting a job for one woman. It's about making life more fair for women everywhere. It's not about a piece of the existing pie; there are too many of us for that. It's about baking a new pie.","The most hurtful thing is not what comes from our adversaries, it's what comes from our friends.","If the shoe doesn't fit, must we change the foot?","The first problem for all of us, men and women, is not to learn, but to unlearn.","Like art, revolutions come from combining what exists into what has never existed before.","Liberation does not come from outside.","The first resistance to social change is to say it's not necessary.","I hate to generalize, but in general, both men and women suffer from ageism. Men much less because men gain power as they get older. Women lose power as they get older. Men are seen as gaining experience and being distinguished. Sons look forward to replacing their fathers.","A pedestal is as much a prison as any small, confined space.","If you hear a statistic, you will make up a story to go with it, because our brains are organized on narrative. And you may very well make up a wrong story because you only have one fact, which is a statistic.","Power can be taken, but not given. The process of the taking is empowerment in itself.","Obviously, there is much similarity among the challenges of transgender people and all women - from health care to harassment to discrimination in the workplace.","It's easier to blame the person with less power.","Movements are like rivers. Dipping into them is never the same twice.","Nothing changes the gender equation more significantly than women's economic freedom.","Everything about aging in my experience so far has been a plus. Except the death part!","Perfect is boring: Beauty is irregular.","We've begun to raise daughters more like sons... but few have the courage to raise our sons more like our daughters.","Pop culture shapes our ideas of what is normal and what our dreams can be and what our roles are. Politics, of course, decides how the power and the money in the country is distributed. Both are equally important, and each affects the other.","Burnout is a way of telling you that your form of activism was perhaps not very full circle.","The thing about aging is all your old lovers, pretty much if they were really friends, become your family. It's great. You have those terrible feelings of possessiveness and uncertainty go out the window. You have what you shared. You know you would help each other in times of trouble no matter what.","We'll never solve the feminization of power until we solve the masculinity of wealth.","Secretary of state is far superior to vice president, because it's involved in continuously solving problems and making policy and not being on standby.","If you say, I'm for equal pay, that's a reform. But if you say. I'm a feminist, that's a transformation of society.","No man can call himself liberal, or radical, or even a conservative advocate of fair play, if his work depends in any way on the unpaid or underpaid labor of women at home, or in the office.","For much of the female half of the world, food is the first signal of our inferiority. It lets us know that our own families may consider female bodies to be less deserving, less needy, less valuable.","The abolition and suffrage movements progressed when united and were damaged by division; we should remember that.","I'm a freelance person, and I've always been able to support myself.","We can tell our values by looking at our checkbook stubs.","Women tend to need the healthcare system more because we bear children. Insurance companies - not all of them, but many of them - 'gender-rate.' Women may pay 40% more for their health insurance than men do.","What is frustrating is being told that no matter how hard I've worked, it counts less than my appearance. Although if you're not considered conventionally attractive, that also becomes an issue: you know, you're a feminist because you couldn't get a man.","There's no greater gift than thinking that you had some impact on the world, for the better.","Childbirth is more admirable than conquest, more amazing than self-defense, and as courageous as either one.","The future depends entirely on what each of us does every day; a movement is only people moving.","Any woman who chooses to behave like a full human being should be warned that the armies of the status quo will treat her as something of a dirty joke. That's their natural and first weapon. She will need her sisterhood.","The deepest change begins with men raising children as much as women do and women being equal actors in the world outside the home. There are many ways of supporting that, from something as simple as paid sick leave and flexible work hours to attributing an economic value to all caregiving and making that amount tax deductible.","Gender is probably the most restricting force in American life.","A woman reading Playboy feels a little like a Jew reading a Nazi manual.","We need to remember across generations that there is as much to learn as there is to teach.","Girls actually need superheroes much more than boys.","Men should think twice before making widow hood woman's only path to power.","There is nothing more fundamental than the idea that the government does not have a right to decide when and whether we have children.","A movement is only composed of people moving. To feel its warmth and motion around us is the end as well as the means.","The Constitution did not mention women when it was first written, and it still doesn't.","The state of female artists is very good. But the very definition of art has been biased in that 'art' was what men did in a European tradition and 'crafts' were what women and natives did. But it's actually all the same.","The Miss America Pageant reinforces a belief that women are merely how they look and how they please.","Rich cultures, patriarchal cultures, value thin women, like ours; poor ones value fat women. But all patriarchal cultures value weak women. So for women to become physically strong is very profound.","In the suffragist and abolitionist era, there were a lot of white women and some black men and women who argued for the old hierarchy and against universal adult suffrage - often on religious grounds.","If you ask men about their body image, they will tell you they look better than they do. And if you ask a woman, she'll tell you she looks worse.","When I'm talking to groups that are all men, we talk about how the masculine role limits them. They often want to talk about how they missed having real fathers, real loving, present fathers, because of the way that they tried to fit the picture of masculinity.","Logic is in the eye of the logician.","The Republican Party supported the Equal Rights Amendment before the Democratic Party did. But what happened was that a lot of very right-wing Democrats, after the civil rights bill of 1964, left the Democratic Party and gradually have taken over the Republican Party.","I'm so happy that we're finally hearing the stories and voices of women who make America. We do what we see, not what we're told, so an incomplete story of this country damages everyone.","Anger is energising. The opposite of anger is depression, which is anger turned inward.","Writing is the only thing that, when I do it, I don't feel I should be doing something else.","It is more rewarding to watch money change the world than watch it accumulate.","It's an incredible con job when you think about it, to believe something now in exchange for something after death. Even corporations with their reward systems don't try to make it posthumous.","If women are supposed to be less rational and more emotional at the beginning of our menstrual cycle when the female hormone is at its lowest level, then why isn't it logical to say that, in those few days, women behave the most like the way men behave all month long?","If you're going to have a male-dominant system, to maintain the system, you have to teach men to dominate.","You can compel fear. You can even make someone feel they're in love if they're isolated and dependent for long enough. But laughter is free.","The electoral system is not where change starts - it usually starts in communities and from the bottom up - but it is where change can be stopped.","In a general way, anything that affects men is taken more seriously than anything that affects only women.","All women, and men of color - we were owned like tables and chairs. We spent a hundred years getting a legal identity as human beings. That's a big thing.","The error that we tend to make is that we think that women's magazines are what editors want and what their readers want - and thus are social indicators - when, in fact, they are what advertisers want. They're just advertising indicators.","We're never going to have democratic countries or peaceful countries until we have democratic or peaceful families.","It's heartbreaking to watch people working against themselves.","I'm not saying that women leaders would eliminate violence. We are not more moral than men; we are only uncorrupted by power so far. When we do acquire power, we might turn out to have an equal impulse toward aggression.","If I read the word 'problematize' one more time, I'm going to vomit.","The problem for all women is we're identified by how we look instead of by our heads and our hearts.","I've yet to be on a campus where most women weren't worrying about some aspect of combining marriage, children, and a career. I've yet to find one where many men were worrying about the same thing.","I'd like to be played as a child by Natalie Wood. I'd have some romantic scenes as Audrey Hepburn and have gritty black-and-white scenes as Patricia Neal.","Law and justice are not always the same."],"Gloria Stuart":["A woman's heart is a deep ocean of secrets.","When I graduated from Santa Monica High in 1927, I was voted the girl most likely to succeed. I didn't realize it would take so long.","When I went back to New York with somewhat of a name, they didn't want movie actresses.","When I was little I thought, isn't it nice that everybody celebrates on my birthday? Because it's July 4th.","There's no point in working if I'm not involved and interested.","The John Ford pictures I made are highly regarded, but at the time they didn't seem like that.","The great actresses and actors receive awards for great roles in great films.","It was a struggle treating Claude Rains as my lover, but we were friendly. It was no great love affair.","It never occurred to me that it would be a big hit internationally and forever.","In the '60s, '70s and '80s, everybody was pretty tense on the set.","I've been very, very successful. It's very satisfying to me.","I wanted to be on the stage, doing very important emotional roles.","I quit after my seven-year contract with Universal was up. I quit for 33 years.","I never had a great role in a great film.","I love working.","I just finished my 11th book last week, so I'm ready to start the next one.","I have enjoyed acting very much, because I know it's not for real!","Claude Rains was what we call an actor's actor. He was very involved with himself and his performance.","I'm amazed. When I was 40, I thought I'd never make 50. And at 50 I thought the frosting on the cake would be 60. At 60, I was still going strong and enjoying everything.","I had been told by so many people that I was going to be nominated, that I should be nominated, that there wasn't any question about my being nominated. I don't think it was a surprise.","I wanted to be a theater actress, but I thought it would be easier to get to New York and the theater if I had a name than if I just walked the streets as a little girl from California.","I have a private press. I'm a book artist. I publish books of other authors and artists. I do the illustrating. I set the type. I print it myself on my press. I do everything but bind it."],"Gloria Swanson":["Life and death. They are somehow sweetly and beautifully mixed, but I don't know how.","All they had to do was put my name on a marquee and watch the money roll in.","The English press treated the world premiere of my first talking picture as a major event.","As Daddy said, life is 95 percent anticipation.","Writing the story of your own life is a bit like drilling your own teeth.","My sculpture is very personal; for years my subjects were family and close, close friends.","Sunset Boulevard opened in August 1950, and it was pronounced the best movie ever made about Hollywood.","I became a fanatic about healthy food in 1944.","Fame was thrilling only until it became grueling. Money was fun only until you ran out of things to buy.","In two months Joseph Kennedy had taken over my entire life, and I trusted him implicitly to make the most of it.","Much as I cared for Joseph Kennedy, he was a classic example of that person in the arts with lots of brains and drive but little taste or talent.","My greatest debt will always be to the movie-going public of yesterday and today, without whose love and devotion I would have had no story to tell.","We lived on the Key West Army Base. Key West for me was a tropical island paradise.","My mother and I could always look out the same window without ever seeing the same thing.","Because I take care of my body, it doesn't look like the body of a woman of my years.","I've given my memoirs far more thought than any of my marriages. You can't divorce a book.","All creative people should be required to leave California for three months every year.","After 16 years in pictures I could not be intimidated easily, because I knew where all the skeletons were buried.","At 26 I felt myself a victim rather than a victor in the realm of pictures.","By the time I was 15, my mother had turned me into a real clotheshorse.","From the first moment on the set I was consumed with curiousity about the technical side of shooting a sound picture.","I always anticipated difficulties in order to avoid scenes.","I am a very pragmatic person.","I consider anybody who weighs over 200 pounds fat, and time was when I could not refrain from telling such people so.","I didn't want to spend the rest of my life playing Norma Desmond over and over again.","I doubted that there were Communists hiding behind every corporation desk and director's chair.","I entered the cosmetics industry because I wanted more women to use cosmetics made with safe, healthful ingredients.","I feel sure that unborn babies pick their parents.","I had starred in more than 30 successful films, six in a row directed by Cecil B. De Mille.","I was 25 and the most popular celebrity in the world, with the possible exception of my friend Mary Pickford.","I was married when I was 17. I knew nothing. I was full of romance.","I was the first celebrity in pictures to be marrying a titled European.","If you're 40 years old and you've never had a failure, you've been deprived.","Nobody gets anything for nothing.","One of the networks sent me a TV set to watch. I didn't care for the medium. It depressed me.","Sam Wood, the director, made most of his money as a real estate agent; there was nothing of the temperamental artist about him.","Tennessee Williams was a gifted talker with a beautiful accent and we had lots of things in common.","The day I initiated divorce proceedings against Michael Farmer, I was ready to retire to a desert cave and rethink my life.","The first feminine feature that goes, with advancing age, is the neck.","The fuss that actors began making about the difficulty of shifting to sound struck me as perfectly foolish.","The major gossip columnists were more concerned with protecting the industry than with gunning down sinners.","The only time I ever went hunting I remembered it as a grisly experience.","The Paramount executives were so pleased with Sunset Boulevard that they asked me to do a publicity tour.","The Sennett system of making pictures was actually fun. You never knew what the person next to you was going to do.","There was no place at all for me in my father's military world.","Your body is the direct result of what you eat as well as what you don't eat.","I am big. It's the pictures that got small.","When I die, my epitaph should read: She Paid the Bills. That's the story of my private life."],"Gloria Trevi":["Sometimes God writes straightforward in twisted lines.","I don't know much about modern art, but I guess I am modern art.","Who is more in touch with the problems of this country? One of those guys who goes off to Oxford or to University of Yale, or someone who has lived in buses, in the Metro, in the street?","I don't bear any bitterness towards anyone.","Activists are killed in Mexico.","Many artists in Mexico fight to be the Latina Madonna. I don't want that! Never! Maybe she's the American Gloria Trevi!","My life would be in danger if I return to Mexico.","I was in love once, and it was terrible.","A lot of people thought this dream must be madness, but we are not crazy.","Ever since I was 7 years old, I wanted to be great.","An album is like a child and after a while I was ready to give birth!","I am not going to play the victim.","I was in love once. It was terrible.","Nowadays, performers worry too much about how they look. They're not concerned about what they're really saying to their audience.","Young people are not only rebels. They have a special heart.","My fans like the rebel in me.","I never have been an anarchist, I've always had goals and always have acted out of love."],"Gloria Vanderbilt":["The heart of another is a dark forest.","I was born during an eclipse. I believe very much in astrology. If you were born on an eclipse it indicates your destiny is chaotic.","I love to think that animals and humans and plants and fishes and trees and stars and the moon are all connected.","The fame you earn has a different taste from the fame that is forced upon you.","When anybody says, 'Why me?' Why is 'me' exempt?","You must always have great, secret, big fat hopes for yourself in love and in life. The bigger, the better.","I do take very good care of myself, and I'm always in love. And by that I mean I have an appetite for life. I'm in love with beauty and things and people and love and being in love, and those things I think, on the inside, show on the outside.","I've always believed that one woman's success can only help another woman's success.","And it came to me, and I knew what I had to have before my soul would rest. I wanted to belong - to belong to my mother. And in return - I wanted my mother to belong to me.","All art, from the paintings on the walls of cave dwellers to art created today, is autobiographical because it comes from the secret place in the soul where imagination resides.","I believe in marriage and fidelity.","The minute that you bring a unicorn into a story, you know that it's a fairy tale or a fable, because unicorns don't exist as animals. They exist as fantasy creatures.","Everything in life is elusive.","I do spend money. I like to spend money, on houses - on furnishing houses. And I love to give presents to people. It's just in my nature to be that way. I always spent money I had. And I always spent what I made. I'm not stingy.","I don't read anything about myself. As a child, there was something in me that was just instinctive. I want to be clear in my spirit, and I don't want to be blocked by things that get inside of you and kill you.","I do think all art is autobiographical, and I do think I know quite a bit about women. I don't know anything about men.","A work of fiction is conceived very much the same way as a dream occurs in the mind of a sleeper.","I've been really very fortunate with the men I've been involved with. They've always really treated me very, very wonderfully. And whenever anything broke up, I was always the one to leave. So I think I've been really very, very lucky.","I don't think age has anything to do with what you write about.","If you've never had a mother or a father, you grow up seeking something you're never going to find, ever. You seek it in love and in people and in beauty.","In anything there has to be dark and light. There's a lot of joy in my paintings and a lot of darkness.","The only thing that would ever embarrass me would be something I would write that would be badly written.","I can't bear to look at Paris Hilton and all that. I mean, it really doesn't grab me. I don't think she's interesting, and the sense of values seems sort of off-kilter.","I don't like cold people at all. It makes me feel really insecure.","When I started travelling, I would go to a city and be on television and I used to get the question, 'Why do you work? If I were you, I'd just go and lie on a beach somewhere.' And I'd answer, 'Well, I wanted to make something of my life.'","If you don't have a father, you don't miss it, because you don't know what it is. It was really only when I married Wyatt Cooper that I understood what it was like to have a father, because he was just an extraordinary father.","I've had many, many loves. I always feel that something wonderful is going to happen. And it always does.","In mythology and palmistry, the left hand is called the dreamer because the ring finger on the left hand leads directly to the heart. I find it a very poetic idea. And that's why I only wear nail polish on my left ring finger.","Many times, working is kind of like channeling, and I really don't know what's going to fall on the page. I just did this image of a fat girl and put her on a tiny mountain peak of grass that she's walking over. It just amused me.","Art brings a message into a room. It should make us perceive in a new way - either through color, form or narrative content - something we had not perceived before... and perhaps reveal something to you about yourself.","Throughout my life I have taken detours in acting and writing, but art remains my abiding passion.","I lived in Europe until I was 9, really.","I don't categorize myself as an 85-year-old woman who has written an erotic novel. I categorize myself as a writer who's written an erotic novel.","A work of fiction is conceived very much the same way as a dream occurs in the mind of a sleeper. But a lot of it is imagination. It's not based on real people.","I'm in love with beauty and things and people and love and being in love, and those things, I think, on the inside, show on the outside."],"Gloria Votsis":["I'm into the vampire stuff. I think it's really fascinating and interesting. There's a lot of history behind all of that, and if you look into it, it's really interesting stuff.","I just think when you read something that's magnetic that pulls you into it or resonates with you, whatever that may be, that's always a positive thing. And you never know what that's going to be.","I'm just really into going out to eat and restaurants in general.","'White Collar' is really a unique family where people kind of all get each other, and they're all on the same page. I was really fortunate because when I got there, I kind of just immediately fit right in with everybody.","I just think when you read something that's magnetic that pulls you into it or resonates with you, whatever that may be, that's always a positive thing.","I love to cook.

You stand or fall by your own efforts.","I would sooner play in a good British picture than in the majority of American pictures I have seen.","It is sensible to have a safeguard against unemployment."],"Glynn Turman":["'Super 8' was a lot of fun. It was a lot of fun working with J.J. Abrams, who I think is a kid in a grown man's body, which is a great ingredient for any artist in our business. You have to be a kid at heart to be able to make believe, and his imagination is phenomenal.","I started with Sidney Poitier and Ruby Dee and Lou Gossett, Jr. and the rest of the wonderful cast of 'A Raisin In The Sun.' We were directed by the great Lloyd Richards. The play was written by the wonderful Lorraine Hansberry, and it was produced by Phil Rose. That's where my start was, so... not a bad way to start.","Enrollment in colleges, especially black colleges, across the country increased tremendously during the five-year run of 'A Different World,' and I don't think you could have a better legacy than that.","Seems like everybody has seen 'Cooley High.' That's what put me on the map. Garrett Morris and I go way back, even before the movie. Great guy. We've done theater and stage plays together, Lincoln Center and all kinds of things.","I'm a stage actor. You know, I was - I cut my teeth on stage, you know. So I've always had a love affair with the stage, first off, what I was raised in, you know.","We do have a black president, and that means a lot. People ask, 'What has he done?' What he's done is change the color up, which you see on the screen. When the head of the free world is black, there's got to be some sort of spin-off from it.","If you take the '70s with Blaxploitation pictures, there was a proliferation of black-content films and motion pictures, television, stage plays and so forth at a time when Hollywood was in trouble financially, and it was cheaper to do black films to keep the lights on until they could reestablish themselves.","My wife and I have our date nights. We love the Showtime shows like 'Shameless,' 'Homeland' and 'House of Lies.' And of course, 'Scandal' is high on the list; you've got to do 'Scandal.'","'12 Years a Slave' was very powerful, very moving, and deserved all of the acclaim it did get."],"Gnash":["Today's a beautiful day, and yesterday was a beautiful day, so that means it's a great life.","Whatever you wanna be, just, at the end of the day, if you're being a good person, which is not hard to be, and you're putting positive energy into the world, and you're appreciative and loving to the people around you that care about you and everybody in general, then it'll work out.","Life is all about balance and following what the universe provides for you.","Sometimes there's these things in life that hit at the right time, and it connects with people in the right way.","I've been a DJ since I was about 13, and I started out as a hip-hop DJ. So I was always playing records that would just get people going. I was just doing parties and high school dances and whatever, and then, progressively, I started making my own music, writing little songs here and there, but it was never anything crazy.","I have faith in the idea that there will be another hit, but I'm also totally happy if there's not, because I know that as long as I keep making music that's me, the people who love me for me will stick around. That's all I really care about.","Home is where I'm most comfortable.","All I can hope for is songs that feel special and songs that make people feel.","You should never be embarrassed or ashamed of listening to a particular type of music.","My label, my genre, my everything is happy sad - I do a smiley face with eyes on both sides. So basically to me, it's totally okay to be happy and sad at the same time, it's totally okay just to be sad, it's totally okay to be happy.","We went through an era of big dance records, an era of hip-hop being the biggest thing on the planet. The people who really break through are the people who are not afraid to express themselves in how they feel.","My real name is Garrett Nash, so G is just the g and nash.","One of the biggest things growing up that my dad taught me is that if I was okay to talk about my feelings and express how I felt and not get angry, then he would listen to me. If I had issues, I would just tell him, 'Here's how I feel, this is what I'm feeling,' either with him or with my mom.","I was at a Thai restaurant when 'i hate u, i love u' hit the million-listen mark. It was weird because nothing else I released before had gotten that high at all.","Definitely one of the biggest influences on my music is the music that Ben Gibbard's associated with, so Death Cab and The Postal Service.","I listen to a lot of Beatles. I have a very specific Beatles discography that I go to.","My dad got me the same mic I use on everything now - this $200 mic from Guitar Center."],"Go Ah-sung":["I don't think I can be a bright and fresh-looking actress.

The publisher of that book's logo were glasses, and those glasses came to my mind when I was thinking of having a tattoo.","I do not think direct experience is always necessary to act, but I believe that sometimes you have to have had the real experience to act certain roles. One of those was losing your family member. I was not being able to imagine how sad that could be.","I saw Roland Barthes's 'Mourning Diary' at a bookshop, and I felt it was like I was destined to see the book. I read it all in one go while I was in the shop. The book was mind-blowing.","I don't really have one style; I just choose what I like best each time.","Prior to 'Snowpiercer,' I've done many other international project that forced me to be in an environment where I had to converse in English."],"Godfrey Gao":["My childhood dream was to play basketball, actually.","I like Taiwanese food, of course. I like baguettes, especially the ones that my dad buys. Vancouver has a lot of variety, with pizza, hot dogs, Italian, Indian, seafood - a great combination of culture.","I like a lot of food. I like Taiwanese food, of course. I like baguettes, especially the ones that my dad buys. Vancouver has a lot of variety, with pizza, hot dogs, Italian, Indian, seafood - a great combination of culture.","Sometimes I read that I'm not 100 per cent Chinese, because I don't look all that Chinese. That's a strange one - I am Chinese.","I kind of got into TV when I went to visit a show my brother was working on. Soon I got the second lead in a TV show.","'The Mortal Instruments' is based on a series of novels by Cassandra Clare; it has been a New York Times bestseller, so it is pretty popular.","Hopefully, I can cross over into Hollywood, and hopefully that will bring me a bigger name in China.","My brother's friend worked at a TV station, so we went in; the producer of a show asked if I wouldn't mind taking some photos for his wife, who was a talent agent. Next thing I know, I'm enroute to the agency.","After I grew some facial hair, I looked a bit older, and I guess that's what the modeling world wanted because I started booking more luxury brands.","In Asia, it is very hectic - there is no overtime, no holidays, no weekends. It's pretty rushed because they are trying to cut the deadline.","Hopefully I can go back and forth from the United States to Asia. I feel joint productions could be the way of the future. I'll need a private plane to charter the international waters!"],"Godfrey Hounsfield":["Some time ago, I investigated the possibility that a computer might be able to reconstruct a picture from sets of very accurate X-ray measurements taken through the body at a multitude of different angles.","Don't worry too much if you don't pass exams, so long as you feel you have understood the subject. It's amazing what you can get by the ability to reason things out by conventional methods, getting down to the basics of what is happening.","Aeroplanes interested me, and at the outbreak of the Second World War, I joined the RAF as a volunteer reservist. I took the opportunity of studying the books which the RAF made available for radio mechanics and looked forward to an interesting course in radio.","During the development of the whole-body CT scanner, it became clear that the availability of an accurate cross-sectional picture of the body, the CT 'slice,' would have an important effect on the precision and implementation of radiotherapy treatment planning.","In the past, radiation treatment planning has been a very lengthy procedure. Now, with the aid of CT therapy-planning computer programs, we can position the therapy beams automatically with precision in a few minutes.","On a farm, you can get very bored.","The periods between my 11th and 18th years remain the most vivid in my memory because this was the time of my first attempts at experimentation, which might never have been made had I lived in the city. I made hazardous investigations of the principles of flight, launching myself from the tops of haystacks with a homemade glider.","I was born and brought up near a village in Nottinghamshire and in my childhood enjoyed the freedom of the rather isolated country life. After the First World War, my father had bought a small farm, which became a marvelous playground for his five children.","I joined the staff of EMI in Middlesex in 1951, where I worked for a while on radar and guided weapons and later ran a small design laboratory. During this time, I became particularly interested in computers, which were then in their infancy. It was interesting, pioneering work at that time: drums and tape decks had to be designed from scratch.","Apart from my work, my greatest pleasures have been mainly out-of-doors, and although I no longer ski, I greatly enjoy walking in the mountains and leading country rambles. I am fond of music, whether light or classical, and play the piano in a self-taught way. In company, I enjoy lively, way-out discussions."],"Godfrey Reggio":["Having been an educator for so many years I know that all a good teacher can do is set a context, raise questions or enter into a kind of a dialogic relationship with their students.","I think it's naive to pray for world peace if we're not going to change the form in which we live.","It's not that we use technology, we live technology.","Now having said that, I realize that releasing a film in the real world is like trying to get General Motors to release a handmade car.","It's not just the effect of technology on the environment, on religion, on the economic structure, on society, on politics, etc. It's that everything now exists in technology to the point where technology is the new and comprehensive host of nature of life.","It is very easy to make clear what you want a film to say, but I did not wish to engage in overt propaganda, even for the right cause. I wanted to create an experience through the films, something where people could have the freedom of their own response to them.","Technology has become as ubiquitous as the air we breathe, so we are no longer conscious of its presence.","History has been the history of warfare.","In terms of the feeling of the piece, I cant think about what people are gonna think about it, what are the critics gonna say, I'm trying to bring some resolution, and realize that myself. It's a struggle; it's a process that gets us this.","The language of the moment or, as it were, the language of the order in which we live, is the image. I felt that if I wanted to commune with the public, I should best do so through the language of image. It's a conscious embrace of a contradiction.","The only thing I can do is type. I learned that when I was 13.","In effect, I feel like a blind, deaf, and illiterate person working through the sensibilities and multiple, real talents of other people. Everything I do is collaborative.","These films however, have ambiguity built into them, because it's too easy in film to make a strident work of propaganda or advertising, which are really the same thing anyway, meaning the message is unmistakable.","Technology is not neutral.","All tools have intrinsic politics and technology is the tool of now.","I think there's an enormous value to being negative. The world we live in today, negativity is not permitted.","But in fact if you look at film as a metaphor, only through the negative can you have the positive print. What I'm trying to get to is the positive value of negation.","I think it's the tragedy of our time that we're not aware of the affect of the manner in which we've adopted tools. Those tools have become who we are.","What I'm trying to do is to at least raise a flag to the blinding light of technology.","In the order I was in, each brother takes five vows, one of which is teaching the poor gratuitously. As a young person I was seized by this idea of social justice and I wanted very much to follow my vow of teaching the poor gratuitously.","So, not for lack of love of language, but because I feel our language is in an enormous state of humiliation, I decided to make films without words.","Mystery is gone to the certainty of technological principles. So the real terror, the real aggression against life comes in the form of the pursuit of our technological happiness.","So to hope to be able to have peace, to be able to have justice and environmental balance, are consequences of our behavior, not just our intentions."],"Godfrey Winn":["No man succeeds without a good woman behind him. Wife or mother, if it is both, he is twice blessed indeed.","The dull routine of our daily job takes on a new significance, assumes a beauty and importance undreamt of before, if we consider it from the angle of service to God."],"Godfried Danneels":["Global warming has melted the polar ice caps, raised the levels of the oceans and flooded the earth's great cities. Despite its evident prosperity, New Jersey is scarcely Utopia.","The word survivor suggests someone who has emerged alive from a plane crash or a natural disaster. But the word can also refer to the loved ones of murder victims, and this was the sense in which it was used at a four-day conference in early June at Boston College.","Artificial Intelligence leaves no doubt that it wants its audiences to enter a realm of pure fantasy when it identifies one of the last remaining islands of civilization as New Jersey.","Rome should sometimes intervene and say this or that is not in conformity with the Catholic faith. Theologians should understand that. Some theologians go too far, for example, reducing the Catholic faith to a universal philosophy.","Our theology is still in a time of crisis, and I think this will last for some years more.","At synods, I usually wait about a week before I speak. First I listen. I feel the temperature. I listen to what has been said, what has not been said, and what I think needs to be said at that point.","I prepared my intervention the night before I spoke. As it happened, there were about 44 cardinals who wished to speak but could not because there was not enough time. I was one of the last to speak.","Before Vatican II, in theology, as in other areas, the discipline was fixed. After the council there has been a revolution - a chaotic revolution - with free discussion on everything. There is now no common theology or philosophy as there was before.","The problem for Rome, then, is how and when the intervention should be done with a sense of the possibility of going too far in limiting the freedom of theologians. This is not an easy time - neither for Rome nor for the theologians.","Accusations are made directly to Rome about theologians from persons who are not theologians. Some of these accusations are anonymous. The local bishop should be the one to relate to theologians to determine orthodoxy.","There is a very well-defined procedure that allows the Vatican to raise issues with a particular theologian about something that does not appear in conformity with the Catholic faith. It is not always easy to make this determination."],"Goenawan Mohamad":["Age is not our fault.","I fear if I cannot think again, if my mind suddenly goes blank. It will be embarrassing.","What I like about theater is its team work. Theater is also all-time creativity."],"Goh Chok Tong":["My main mission when I became Prime Minister, was to keep Singapore going and Singapore has been kept going. So, I'm happy with what I've done for Singapore.","As people grow up and they want more freedom, it's on an individual basis, children want to have more freedom, you've got to allow that, so how do you balance it. I would say let it evolve, move as quickly or slowly as people would like to move.","I wanted to become a writer. I enjoyed reading as a child."],"Golan Levin":["The free sharing and teaching of open source is incompatible with the notion of the solitary genius.","Imagine spending seven years at MIT and research laboratories, only to find out that you're a performance artist.","I think there's a great homogenizing force that software imposes on people and limits the way they think about what's possible on the computer. Of course, it's also a great liberating force that makes possible, you know, publishing and so forth, and standards, and so on.","I'm an artist and an engineer, which is, increasingly, a more common kind of hybrid. But I still fall into this weird crack where people don't seem to understand me.","In my own case, I'm an artist, and I'm really interested in expanding the vocabulary of human action, and basically empowering people through interactivity. I want people to discover themselves as actors, as creative actors, by having interactive experiences."],"Golda Meir":["Trust yourself. Create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life. Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.","One cannot and must not try to erase the past merely because it does not fit the present.","You'll never find a better sparring partner than adversity.","Not being beautiful was the true blessing. Not being beautiful forced me to develop my inner resources. The pretty girl has a handicap to overcome.","Old age is like a plane flying through a storm. Once you're aboard, there's nothing you can do.","The dog that trots about finds a bone.","To be or not to be is not a question of compromise. Either you be or you don't be.","Let me tell you something that we Israelis have against Moses. He took us 40 years through the desert in order to bring us to the one spot in the Middle East that has no oil!","We Jews have a secret weapon in our struggle with the Arabs; we have no place to go.","I don't know why you use a fancy French word like detente when there's a good English phrase for it - cold war.","Don't be humble... you're not that great.","Whether women are better than men I cannot say - but I can say they are certainly no worse.","A leader who doesn't hesitate before he sends his nation into battle is not fit to be a leader.","Above all, this country is our own. Nobody has to get up in the morning and worry what his neighbors think of him. Being a Jew is no problem here.","To be successful, a woman has to be much better at her job than a man.","We don't thrive on military acts. We do them because we have to, and thank God we are efficient.","There's no difference between one's killing and making decisions that will send others to kill. It's exactly the same thing, or even worse.","We do not rejoice in victories. We rejoice when a new kind of cotton is grown and when strawberries bloom in Israel.","We have always said that in our war with the Arabs we had a secret weapon - no alternative.","Those who don't know how to weep with their whole heart, don't know how to laugh either.","It is true we have won all our wars, but we have paid for them. We don't want victories anymore.","It's no accident many accuse me of conducting public affairs with my heart instead of my head. Well, what if I do? Those who don't know how to weep with their whole heart don't know how to laugh either.","The Soviet government is the most realistic regime in the world - no ideals.","I never did anything alone. Whatever was accomplished in this country was accomplished collectively.","The Egyptians could run to Egypt, the Syrians into Syria. The only place we could run was into the sea, and before we did that we might as well fight.","Glorious bouquets and storms of applause are the trimmings which every artist naturally enjoys.","I can honestly say that I was never affected by the question of the success of an undertaking. If I felt it was the right thing to do, I was for it regardless of the possible outcome.","I must govern the clock, not be governed by it.","Ability hits the mark where presumption overshoots and diffidence falls short.","Being seventy is not a sin.","Even paranoids have real enemies.","There can be no doubt that the average man blames much more than he praises. His instinct is to blame. If he is satisfied he says nothing; if he is not, he most illogically kicks up a row.","Authority poisons everybody who takes authority on himself.","Pessimism is a luxury that a Jew can never allow himself.","As President Nixon says, presidents can do almost anything, and President Nixon has done many things that nobody would have thought of doing.","Fashion is an imposition, a reign on freedom.","Men who have reached and passed forty-five, have a look as if waiting for the secret of the other world, and as if they were perfectly sure of having found out the secret of this.","Women's liberation is just a lot of foolishness. It's men who are discriminated against. They can't bear children. And no one is likely to do anything about that.","The public history of modern art is the story of conventional people not knowing what they are dealing with."],"Goldie Hawn":["One way to feel good about yourself is to love yourself... to take care of yourself.","The only thing that will make you happy is being happy with who you are, and not who people think you are.","Whether you're successful or not, you'll never actually feel the joys of accomplishment unless you love yourself. Success can be very difficult to deal with. You have to stay in the center. If you let your success define you, then you're really just setting yourself up for failure.","I have witnessed the softening of the hardest of hearts by a simple smile.","I'm a dreamer with lots of energy and a vivid imagination. That's the recipe for becoming an entertainer.","We go into restaurants, and people aren't talking anymore. They're texting. While they are sitting at a restaurant with each other. So we're losing this intimacy that we need to have as human beings.","I want to know where joy lives. I'd interview scientists, religious leaders and heads of state. I'd want to find out exactly what makes people happy. I'd want to look into the biology, the chemistry of the human brain.","Getting older is a fact of life.","Paparazzi will try to get the most controversial picture of you in a compromising position because that's how they're going to sell it.","It is not the question, what am I going to be when I grow up; you should ask the question, who am I going to be when I grow up.","If you have a sense of yourself, your mission, your belief system, those things will lead you to success.","Continuing to listen and grow is important because we get into bad habits in relationships.","I'm not afraid of my femininity and I'm not afraid of my sexuality.","When I turned 50, I asked some of my girlfriends, all actresses of the same age, 'What are we going to do now?' I wanted to go live somewhere for a while, learn archaeology, or take part in healing the world on some level. I wanted to dig deep and say, 'Who am I now? What do I have to offer? What do I have to learn?'","We haven't given our brain the ability to actually analyze something clearly and appropriately before we speak and before we take action.","What helps with aging is serious cognition - thinking and understanding. You have to truly grasp that everybody ages. Everybody dies. There is no turning back the clock. So the question in life becomes: What are you going to do while you're here?","A lasting relationship isn't about marriage. It's about compatibility and communication. And you both need to want it to work.","The ability to remain calm and focused in stressful situations is central to making positive decisions.","You have to look to the future with optimism instead of negative ideas. Take the good and the bad and face it head on.","Mindfulness can help people of any age. That's because we become what we think.","We have to embrace obstacles to reach the next stage of joy.","Whether you're an actor, producer, writer, or director, it's all about the story you're going to tell.","The interesting part of my spiritual life is studying as much as you can. Islam and Buddhism and Hinduism and Shamanism and Judaism, Christianity - you try to learn what the precepts are, what the religion is, and ultimately, it's based in the same thought, it's based in the same outcome, you know.","I got a heart tattooed on my foot. It's my first tattoo.","My tenacity and determination to be true to the person I had become were sacrosanct.","We can't turn a blind eye to the importance of the well-being of our children, and we need to pay close attention to building the future leaders of tomorrow.","Not every relationship works, and that is the truth, and I don't care whether you're a movie star or just a person on the street, normal life. Everybody's normal, relationships are always normal. I think movie stars have a little bit harder time because the cameras are on there all the time. But you have to be who you are.","Moms and dads don't last forever. If you've got unfinished business, we need to face that, and that's not easy. Every child wants to love their mother and their father. Love is the most important thing, and when they feel rejected and unloved, that hole can never be filled by anyone else.","No relationship is easy, and nobody should ever think it is. The minute you start forgetting the needs of the other person is when you get in trouble.","By living mindfully, you understand that there are many transitions in life. You just go through them.","'Liberation' is an interesting word because you can be liberated from external things and also from your internal dialogue.","I'll bike up the mountain, or I'll do Pilates or spin.","I'm extremely proud of my daughter. She's done amazing work. She's worked on herself, which I think is important.","All I ever wanted to be was happy.","The biggest lesson we have to give our children is truth.","Ditzy dumb blonde? I can be ditzy. I can be.","Love is something in the heart and in the mind, so why would you chastise anyone for that? And this is something that I feel very strongly about.","Men are different than women, and men live with - with some very difficult obstacles. I mean, a man, basically, in his true nature, is to spread his seed, and a woman is a gatherer, and that's kind of the way we're - our limbic system is set up, you know.","If you lose wonder, you've lost everything.","Central to our work and our goal of finding solutions to global problems is the concept of mindfulness, a technique for focusing attention objectively on the here and now.","What is happiness? Happiness, I think, has to come in the beginning, truly, from feeling a sense of well-being within yourself.","I just love good smells.","People ask if I feel pigeon-holed by always doing the same kind of humorous role. But my tool has always been humor because it's the most entertaining way to put any ideology across, and it's fun, and it's positive, and it's a healer. Laughter is God's gift. I feel privileged to be able to do it.","A child's giggle tickles me deeply, and it breaks my heart when that begins to disappear. So I do what I can to create opportunities for children to continue to laugh and rediscover their joy.","I'm a woman who was raised to believe that you are not complete unless you have a man. Well, in some ways it's true. I am a feminist to a point. But I'm not going to deny the fact that I love to be with men.","I wrote the book because I wanted to be able to share some things that I had learned and as pompous as that may sound, as you get to a certain point in life, you figure so what am I doing?","My eyes are too big, my nose is too flat, my ears stick out, my mouth is too big and my face is too small... my body is thin as a clarinet and my ankles are so skinny that I wear two pairs of bobby socks because I don't want people to see how thin they are.","My mother loved the Bible.","Peter Sellers was great to work with. A lovely man. A little bit crazy in that he - you know, as I say, it was hard. It was sort of balancing a very delicate spirit on a needle. You know, because you never know where he was going.","So curiosity, I think, is a really important aspect of staying young or youthful.","To find someone who loves your children like you do is really rare.","Youthfulness is connected to the ability to see things new for the first time. So if your eyes still look at life with wonder, then you will seem young, even though you may not be chronologically young.","I noted that people are happy here in India. When I went back home, people had everything in the materialistic sense and were surrounded with abundance, but they were not happy.","When you have a Jewish mother who has a very strong Jewish family, it's very ethnic in its practices. Eating brisket, the food and the family and the interconnectedness for better or worse.","I've been practicing modalities of Eastern philosophy since about 1972. What I've learned through my meditation is a sense of equanimity, a sense of all things being equal.","I am compelled to continuously see the bright side. It is in my DNA. My kids look at me and say: 'Mom, you're so happy!' And I do feel happy. I feel joyful inside. I can't explain it.","We need to habituate better thinking to appreciate more of your day because that has a neurological correlate.","A body smiles, like, 72 times a day. Where does that smile go? That's what I want to know.","I was born Jewish, and I consider that my religion. But I've studied all religions, and as you learn more, you really learn that everyone's praying to the same God.","I believe having religion in your life creates the potential for long-lasting relationships.","Buddhism is really, one of its main practices is understanding and experiencing compassion, and how that ultimately is a road to happiness.","I've been practicing Buddhism for a while. So, I call myself a Jew-Bu, because my tribe is still Jew. But my philosophy and my practice is really Buddhist.","Attention for children is so much about input, and the brain can only filter so much - I don't know how many millions of messages that come through the brain, and we can only filter so much through it.","It's wonderful to move forward technologically, but we cannot forget that we are human beings who thrive on relationships, who thrive on interconnectivity, who thrive on sharing your feelings and emotions.","I'm deeply, deeply passionate about creating peace and well-being in the classroom, and well-being as a global nation.","Oftentimes, actors are looked at as court jesters. They are not looked at as deep-thinking, smart people who do many other things or have gifts in other areas.","I love making people laugh and by the way I still do that with the charitable efforts on my part because I believe that people need to laugh.","I believe that we all need to do charitable work. It should be taken seriously in the area of education, as someone from the industry.","My parents always supported me, but I was put to task. My father thought when I sang, I was sharp; my mother was upset when I wasn't in the first line at recitals.","When I started go-go dancing on tables for a living, I didn't want to tell my mom or my dad. I made 25 dollars a night, and I was able to make my rent, with the four girls I lived with.","During the era when women were burning their bras - which, by the way, they never actually did - but when women were first becoming liberated, I was 23. And I met a woman who asked, 'Don't you feel bad because you're sort of acting like the stupid airhead blonde?' And I totally surprised myself. I said, 'Liberation can also come from the inside.'","I can't imagine, as a human being, not being able to grow.","I don't like facial hair, and I don't like kissing facial hair, as you cant find the lips.","When you get to a certain age, you have to make a decision for yourself: if you want to get old in the industry, and you want to play maybe a few parts that come along now and then - or what else in life interests you?","The big money goes to kids and young men - big tent-pole movies, which are expensive but have a great return.","My father was Presbyterian.","My mother was the kind of person who was very much part of her tribe and very much a satellite of her tribe. She was the girl who left her family at the age of 17 and went to Washington. My mother was orphaned at three and then was brought up by my aunt Goldie. So, yes she belonged, but there was a part of her that didn't.","The truth is that no matter how old we are, as long as our mothers are alive, we want our mother. And it's a very powerful relationship if it's healthy.","I always wanted to be a mother first.","Sadly, so many arts programs have been eliminated from schools due to budget constraints. These creative outlets are so very important, not only for a child's well-being, but also for self-expression and fun.","I always wanted to understand the causes of happiness. I'm a bit of a scientist, I guess you could say.","What we want to help children with is, just because you feel sad or happy or depressed doesn't mean that is who you are. We want them to know, 'I am really sad right now, but I am not a sad person.'","It's important, at least for me, that while we're entertaining, there's also something substantive to talk about.","When you're female working in a male-dominated industry, there are unfortunately extra things you need to do - for example, couch opinions in a way that sounds palatable and not threatening. That's a skill I developed.","I would have been long divorced if I got married.","If you need to be bound to someone, then it's important to be married. If you are independent, then it's important to not be married.","In relationships, particularly love relationships, people are impatient.","A woman opening a movie with no other star is like a miracle.","Directors didn't want to work with me because I was 'too controlling.' If it had been a man, it wouldn't have meant a damn thing.","I don't eat a lot. I think we overeat.","I do a lot of juicing. I don't put a lot of food in my stomach, and I don't mix my foods too much. So if I want to have, like, protein, I'll just eat a bowl of lentils; I won't mix it with a bunch of stuff.","I try to stay positive and be very, very active.","I walk every day, and I run and do all kinds of that.","I feel there are injustices in the world that I'll stand up for, and I think that it's important to realize that the world is filled with these kinds of issues.","I had a tremendous amount of gay friends, so my whole life was basically like that... I never noticed who was gay or who was straight.","A marriage ends up being a business deal: no matter how long or short it is, somebody owes somebody money.","It's ridiculous to have to base your relationship on money.","Money can destroy people. It really can.","It's nice for a woman to go out and have her own money and her own ability to do what she wants.","It's wonderful to know you're aging, because that means you're still on the planet, right?","You don't meditate once and suddenly your life turns around. What it does is it lets you train your brain to be able to become more stable in an action-oriented way.","Meditation helps people balance and calibrate their left-right brain.","If you're going to train your body, it would be a really good thing to also train your brain.","I was always a performer, always on stage, but I also always believed I was going to go home, open a dance school, get married, and have what you would call a 'normal' life."],"Goldwin Smith":["Personality is lower than partiality.","Never had there been such an attempt to make conquest the servant of civilization. About keeping India there is no question. England has a real duty there.","Above all nations is humanity.","Rome was great in arms, in government, in law.","The Romans, we are told, were by nature a peculiarly warlike race.","Who can doubt that between the English and the French, between the Scotch and the Irish, there are differences of character which have profoundly affected and still affect the course of history?","It is evident that in the period designated as that of the kings, when Rome commenced her career of conquest, she was, for that time and country, a great and wealthy city.","That Rome was comparatively great and wealthy is certain.","The Roman legions were formed in the first instance of citizen soldiers, who yet had been made to submit to a rigid discipline, and to feel that in that submission lay their strength.","The insular arrogance of the English character is a commonplace joke.","The natural barriers between England and Scotland were not sufficient to prevent the extension of the Saxon settlements and kingdoms across the border.","The novelist must ground his work in faithful study of human nature.","The materials of the novelist must be real; they must be gathered from the field of humanity by his actual observation.","The novelist must look on humanity without partiality or prejudice. His sympathy, like that of the historian, must be unbounded, and untainted by sect or party.","Dante himself is open to the suspicion of partiality: it is said, not without apparent ground, that he puts into hell all the enemies of the political cause, which, in his eyes, was that of Italy and God.","I heard Thackeray thank Heaven for the purity of Dickens. I thanked Heaven for the purity of a greater than Dickens - Thackeray himself.","There are the manufacturing multitudes of England; they must have work, and find markets for their work; if machines and the Black Country are ugly, famine would be uglier still.","Art is expression, and to have high expression you must have something high to express.","As to London we must console ourselves with the thought that if life outside is less poetic than it was in the days of old, inwardly its poetry is much deeper.","America is supposed to be given over to ugliness. There are a good many ugly things there and the ugliest are the most pretentious.","Every one who has a heart, however ignorant of architecture he may be, feels the transcendent beauty and poetry of the mediaeval churches.","Yet for my part, deeply as I am moved by the religious architecture of the Middle Ages, I cannot honestly say that I ever felt the slightest emotion in any modern Gothic church.","There is a spell in mediaeval Art which has had power to bewitch some people into trying, or wishing to try, or fancying that they wish to try or making believe to fancy that they wish to try, to bring back the Middle Ages.","If it were a real effort to live in the Middle Ages, your life would be one perpetual prevarication.","No student of history can fail to see the moral interest of the Middle Ages, any more than an artist can fail to see their aesthetic interest.","But if anyone supposes that there was no commercial fraud in the Middle Ages, let him study the commercial legislation of England for that period, and his mind will be satisfied, if he has a mind to be satisfied and not only a fancy to run away with him.","It is needless to say how great has been the influence of the doctrine of Evolution, or rather perhaps of the method of investigation to which it has given birth, upon the study of history, especially the history of institutions.","We must also be permitted to bear in mind that evolution, though it may explain everything else, cannot explain itself.","Whatever things may have been in their origin, they are what they are, both in themselves and in regard to their indications respecting other beings or influences the existence of which may be implied in theirs."],"Golshifteh Farahani":["I have scars from every film I have made. There is nothing to protect actors. They treat you worse than a dog. You work like a slave, and you know, I like it. That is the way it should be. Every film should be like your last.","There's an expression in Persian, 'to play with the lion's tail.' I wasn't what Iranian society wanted me to be - a good girl. I played with the lion's tail.","Iranian parents can't stop their children. They're just wild - they want to party, they want their rights, they want to paint, they want to dance. No one can stop these new generations coming. That's why Iran has to open up: it's like a pot full of hot water, vapour and steam.","Exile is my power.","I don't regret anything and what I have done in my period of my life. Everything happens for a reason, and that's why I am here.","Exile is like death. You cannot understand it until it happens to you.","Paris is a city that liberates you as a woman from all your sins that you think you are guilty of; it washes away all of that, and you are free.","The Iran I'm dreaming of maybe doesn't exist anymore.","If you want to do what you want to do, you cannot work. So art is going to be finished, and this is the will of the Islamic republic: to not have any artists or art and close the doors of all the cinemas and music and everything.","I think there is a problem in France that anyone who is not European, you want to know where they come from and why do they come from somewhere or why they speak English or why they are human. That's the big barrier for all of us that are coming from some far, far away countries. But at the end of the day, we are all artists.","I had to tell people I was not born with a scarf because I came out Iran. People think you came out of your mother with a scarf; they can't imagine that the scarf is not stuck to your head.","Independent cinema is more thoughtful, delicate. While Western blockbusters can have their own kind of delicateness, it's not delicate enough. You have to be ready to compromise to enter that field. I will do so only if it's worth it.","The subjects that I am working are movies that say something. They are shouting or criticising something. I would hate to play a princess waiting for the prince to come and give her a kiss.","In my life, my parents wanted me to be a musician, I was supposed to go to Vienna to study piano. But this train wanted to go in another direction.","For me, Iran was paradise, and I believe it's a paradise still, but only if you don't have political problems. If you have a political problem, paradise turns into hell.","I was born into an artistic family, and they understood me. But they were really worried, because some of the stuff I did was dangerous. If I'd been caught without the veil with a shaved head, I don't know what would have happened.","I'm coming out of the belly of Iran. It was the only place I was free. It's funny - when I say that, everyone is like, 'What? Freedom?' But the freedom I felt in Iran I've never felt anywhere else. Freedom of mind, freedom of time, of spirit. But after a while, you're so wounded that if you continue thinking about Iran, it will kill you.","I don't believe I could live in Iran again. A tree, once uprooted from the earth, is very difficult to plant again."],"Gong Li":["Chinese people become jealous about status more easily. Foreigners are more inclined to look up to successful people. I don't understand why there is a difference. If two people start at the same point and then one person gets ahead, the other should work hard to catch up. But instead, they just curse. They are jealous.","For me, the beauty of a person is a matter of the whole package. You have to look at the whole thing, not just a matter of outward appearance or whatever. It has to do with one's character, personality, upbringing and so on.","Securing food is the basic task for all humans.","Fans in China are very different from those overseas. In China, many people really love me and care about my life. But there is always some jealousy mixed up in this feeling of love. I think that is the big difference. Overseas, there is none of that.","People keep pushing me to be the center of attention... I would prefer to be on the sidelines, because that's where you see more.","The important thing for me when I look at characters is to consider the kind of constraints placed upon them. Now, me personally, I don't like to have a lot of constraints placed upon me.","When I speak in English, my expressions become different. My attitude, too. I'm not sure why, but there really is a difference. My hands move differently when I speak English.","I have been waiting around to get the right script and the right director. For example, in the past, if a Hollywood director came to me with a script and wanted me to play a character, and she was a stereotypical Asian woman who gets into a fight and gets killed off quickly, that didn't seem to have much interest for me.","I am Chinese - it doesn't matter what other people say.","My life has been that of someone who has moved from the countryside to the society. To make that transition, I have had to learn a lot.","I guess my personality is that of a modern, strong Chinese woman. I don't believe in destiny. There are many things that can be changed. I don't like to be defeated by difficulties. I love freedom, so when I am shaping a character, I usually do it the way I want. I always find some part of my own character in a role.","A lot of people ask me to produce or direct, but I don't think I'm qualified. It's hard enough for a person to do just one thing well in their life. I don't want to do too much.","The world looks at China as a big place with a lot of people, a good place to make money. And because so many Chinese families send their kids abroad to study, they are familiar with foreign cultures, so Hollywood films are very successful in China.","I've been to Cannes 15 or 16 times, and every time I go, there's a kind of soul-stirring feeling."],"Goodluck Jonathan":["We want to lead a country where people will be less greedy. Where people will know that the commonwealth of Nigeria belongs to all Nigerians, where people's wealth depends on the people around you. If you become a rich person and everyone around you is poor you are very poor.","My brothers and sisters, we are all winners. In this context there is no victor and no vanquished. We have demonstrated, even in our diversity, the progress of Nigeria remains paramount for all.","In my early days in school, I had no shoes, no school bags. There were days I had only one meal... I walked miles and crossed rivers to school every day. Didn't have power, didn't have generators, studied with lanterns, but I never despaired.","Well-trained medical doctors and engineers leave Nigeria to the developed countries. We want to reverse that.","We want to refocus Nigeria to make sure that basic infrastructure is provided. The environment is created for private investment, both within and direct foreign investment. So jobs will be created. That is my dream for Nigeria.","We will bring justice to the savage terrorists known as Boko Haram. They will be defeated.","One thing that I know and I feel Nigerians will celebrate is continuity and peace.","When you talk about the oil wealth you compare nations. There are some nations with less than five million people. Nigeria has 150 million people. I cannot say that all the money earned from oil since 1958, when the first drop of oil was exported from this country to date, that the money has been effectively used.","The argument about zoning and the presidency of Nigeria is like the philosophical argument of the egg or the hen. Who is older through the evolutionary process, who came first?","I've always affirmed, nobody's ambition is worth the blood of any Nigerian.","I reassure all Nigerians and the international community of our firm commitment to free, fair and credible elections. My commitment to free elections and one man, one vote remains unwavering.","All Nigerians of voting age are free to vote based on their convictions. It is our duty to defend and protect that basic right, and - let no one be in doubt - we will."],"Goodman Ace":["TV - a clever contraction derived from the words Terrible Vaudeville. However, it is our latest medium - we call it a medium because nothing's well done.","I keep reading between the lies.","I would have answered your letter sooner, but you didn't send one.","Moon rocks are OK when everyone is eating.","Politics makes estranged bedfellows.","The best cure for hypochondria is to forget about your body and get interested in someone else's."],"Goose Gossage":["Hitters never showed me up, as hard as I threw. And I was pretty mean out on the mound.","I'd like to be remembered for the way I went about doing my job.","I don't ever remember seeing a base runner who was all the way to third base run back across the mound. It was kind of a respectful thing.","In my opinion, the best setup guys now have a tougher job than the closers. They pitch more innings, inherit more runners.","When I played, Old-Timers' Day was my favorite day of the whole season, because I got to share a locker with one of the great Yankees... It was an out-of-body experience."],"Goran Ivanisevic":["As soon as I step on the court I just try to play tennis and don't find excuses. You know, I just lost because I lost, not because my arm was sore.","It's fun to be there with the guys, to practice with them, arrange the balls, do this, do that, but when you play you can get some of this nervousness out of your system.","Winning Wimbledon was a great feeling and it is still a great feeling. It has given me so much confidence.","It's easier when you play. You get your emotion out. You scream. You yell. You do whatever you want. You play. But it's tough to sit.","I think I owe it to myself and my fans in Britain to play one more Wimbledon.","You can't slow the game here. It's grass, it's always going to be fast.","Although we didn't have much when I was growing up in Split, Croatia, my parents always tried to ensure that my sister and I had the things we needed, and it was enough for us.","While I didn't have everything that I wanted, I was still a happy kid.","At her birthday, my seven-year-old daughter will say that she wants these big cakes and certain expensive toys as presents, and I can't say no to her. It would just break my heart. But when I was little, for birthdays we just played outside and we were happy if we got any cake.","If you are given a lot of money without having to work for it, you won't appreciate it as much as if you made it yourself.","There are not many Irish people playing tennis!","My sporting hero was Drazen Petrovic, the NBA basketball player, who was killed in a car accident in 1993. He was a good friend, an unbelievable player, and I dedicated my Wimbledon win to him.","I must be the only player in the world who ever injured himself for a tournament by stepping on a shell on the beach. I don't know what I'm going to do.","Since retiring I have spent a lot of time with my family, on my boat, and playing football.","The best book I read this year was 'The Da Vinci Code.'"],"Goran Persson":["We think that the Kyoto protocol is a necessary document, necessary process. I am convinced that we will agree to disagree about substance.","Let our New Year's resolution be this: we will be there for one another as fellow members of humanity, in the finest sense of the word.","A human being is so irreplaceable. So valuable and so unique.","Remember one thing - that Sweden is performing better than the rest of Europe.","Do not be afraid that joy will make the pain worse; it is needed like the air we breathe.","Humanity is not a church made of stone, in which vault after vault lies open.","Remember, the burden of sorrow is doubled when it is borne alone.","We must make working life more human.","It is the hope of the European Union that Ariel Sharon will keep the peace process alive and continue the dialogue according to the wishes of all the parties involved."],"Goran Visnjic":["I don't understand the word 'hunk.'","I'm always trying to be a good ambassador for my country.","Easy was, like, spending time with Jennifer on set. Difficult stuff about character is, it was a little bit like just being the only one with no superhuman powers.","I don't want to lose my accent, I just want it to become smaller.","All I ever wanted to do was act.","Acting is my job.","If a great part comes up and the guy's meant to have an Eastern European accent, great; but if it's a bad part I won't take it."],"Gordie Gronkowski, Jr.":["Surround yourself with good people.","Our parents gave us an opportunity to play sports but never really forced us to play. I actually - when I turned 11, decided, you know, I just didn't like playing baseball the year before and, you know, I didn't want to play. And they actually said, hey, if you didn't want to play, take the year off, you know, go enjoy time with your friends.","I played hockey, basketball, and baseball.","My heart has just always been with baseball.","I couldn't tell you why I never played. I played basketball, hockey. I just never got into football."],"Gordie Howe":["You find that you have peace of mind and can enjoy yourself, get more sleep, and rest when you know that it was a one hundred percent effort that you gave - win or lose.","All hockey players are bilingual. They know English and profanity.","You've got to love what you're doing. If you love it, you can overcome any handicap or the soreness or all the aches and pains, and continue to play for a long, long time.","There's always something in the game you wish you would have done different. That's why players improve, because they learn from what they did before. They might have been guessing before, but now they know.","My philosophy is never start talking about 'if,' 'and,' 'but' or the past, because 90 percent of what follows will be negative.","American professional athletes are bilingual; they speak English and profanity.","People say I'm henpecked. Well, let them say it.","If Colleen Howe had been a hockey player, she would have been a centremen. I can see her as a centreman because you can do what you want and go wherever you want to go.","I helped put in a rink in Cadillac, Michigan, when my wife was very healthy. She helped them put it in and the rink is going full-bore the last time I was there.","My mother and dad played the fiddle and the guitar.","The first time I met Wayne Gretzky... he never said anything back."],"Gordon B. Hinckley":["Without hard work, nothing grows but weeds.","You can't build a great building on a weak foundation. You must have a solid foundation if you're going to have a strong superstructure.","Every good citizen adds to the strength of a nation.","Marriage, in its truest sense, is a partnership of equals, with neither exercising dominion over the other, but, rather, with each encouraging and assisting the other in whatever responsibilities and aspirations he or she might have.","I am suggesting that as we go through life, we 'accentuate the positive.' I am asking that we look a little deeper for the good, that we still our voices of insult and sarcasm, that we more generously compliment and endorse virtue and effort.","Life is meant to be enjoyed, not just endured.","I promise you that the time will come, if you have tattoos, that you will regret your actions. They cannot be washed off. They are permanent. Only by an expensive and painful process can they be removed. If you are tattooed, then probably for the remainder of your life you will carry it with you.","Meekness implies a spirit of gratitude as opposed to an attitude of self-sufficiency, an acknowledgement of a greater power beyond oneself, a recognition of God, and an acceptance of his commandments.","A tattoo is graffiti on the temple of the body.","Some of our finest work comes through service to others.","Do you feel gloomy? Lift your eyes. Stand on your feet. Say a few words of appreciation and love to the Lord. Be positive.","I am satisfied that every man or woman who goes to the temple in a spirit of sincerity and faith leaves the house of the Lord a better man or woman.","Jesus said, 'Except a man be born of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.' There are no exceptions. Baptism is a necessary ordinance.","To you wives who are constantly complaining and see only the dark side of life, and feel that you are unloved and unwanted, look into your own hearts and minds. If there is something wrong, turn about. Put a smile on your faces. Make yourselves more attractive. Brighten your outlook.","Parents have no greater responsibility in this world than the bringing up of their children in the right way, and they will have no greater satisfaction as the years pass than to see those children grow in integrity and honesty and make something of their lives.","Life is precious. Life is sacred. And it ought so to be observed.","Dishonesty of any kind will create a blemish.","It has been my privilege on various occasions to converse with presidents of the United States and important men in other governments. At the close of each such occasion, I have reflected on the rewarding experience of standing with confidence in the presence of an acknowledged leader.","Some of you, unfortunately, will never marry in this life. That turns out to be the case sometimes. If that happens, do not spend your life grieving over it. The world still needs your talents. It needs your contribution.","There would be no Christmas if there was no Easter.","The smallest gesture can mean to much to those who may need a little lift in their lives.","Study a foreign language if you have opportunity to do so. You may never be called to a land where that language is spoken, but the study will have given you a better understanding of your own tongue or of another tongue you may be asked to acquire.","You have to establish in your life some sense of prioritizing things, of giving emphasis to the important things and of laying aside the unimportant things that will lead to nothing.","Every sacrament meeting ought to be a spiritual feast.","People are looking for stability in a shaky world. They want something they can get hold of that's firm and sure and an anchor in the midst of all of this instability in which they're living.","Conflict grows out of ignorance and suspicion.","We magnify our priesthood and enlarge our calling when we serve with diligence and enthusiasm in those responsibilities to which we are called by proper authority.","Missionary work has never been easy, and yet the joyful rewards cannot be equaled by any other experience.","We all know that education unlocks the door of opportunity for the young.","Eternal vigilance is the price of eternal development.","Any investigator worthy of baptism becomes a convert worthy of saving.","You dear women, I say thanks to you. Thank you for being the kind of people you are and doing the things you do.","The whole essence of the Christian religion is based on the atonement of Christ, his death and his resurrection.","Knowledge, learning, is an eternal thing.","Through reading the scriptures, we can gain the assurance of the Spirit that that which we read has come of God for the enlightenment, blessing, and joy of his children.","There is no substitute under the heavens for productive labor. It is the process by which dreams become realities. It is the process by which idle visions become dynamic achievements.","I do not fear truth. I welcome it. But I wish all of my facts to be in their proper context.","Choose your friends carefully. It is they who will lead you in one direction or the other.","Our bodies... are the tabernacles of our spirits.","Opportunities for sharing the gospel are everywhere.","Every righteous man or woman is entitled to revelation concerning his own affairs.","We live in a world that is filled with filth and sleaze, a world that reeks of evil. You cannot afford that filthy poison to touch you. Stay away from it. Avoid it.","There are widows who long for friendly voices and that spirit of anxious concern which speaks of love.","With all my heart, I plead with the Latter-day Saints to live honestly with the Lord in the payment of tithes and offerings. I plead with youth to establish this habit while you are still young and to resolve to continue with it all the days of your lives.","The work of the Lord is done by ordinary people who work in an extraordinary way.","I do not concern myself much with reading long commentary volumes designed to enlarge at length upon that which is found in the scriptures. Rather, I prefer to dwell with the source, tasting of the unadulterated waters of the fountain of truth - the word of God as he gave it and as it has been recorded in the books we accept as scripture.","There is need occasionally to leave the noise and the tumult of the world and step within the walls of a sacred house of God, there to feel His Spirit in an environment of holiness and peace.","The problem is, I think, that so many of us pray as if we are ordering groceries. We pick up the telephone and say, 'Is this the right place to place my order?' and we proceed right to dictating our order. When we have then ended that list, we hang up.","Unfortunately, some women want to remake their husbands after their own design.","Respect for self is the beginning of cultivating virtue in men and women.","If you have a temper, now is the time to learn to control it. The more you do so while you are young, the more easily it will happen.","Our lives are the only meaningful expression of what we believe and in Whom we believe. And the only real wealth, for any of us, lies in our faith.","Criticism and pessimism destroy families, undermine institutions of all kinds, defeat nearly everyone, and spread a shroud of gloom over entire nations.","I don't think that the Internet has contributed greatly to immorality.","If you are too busy in your church activities to take care of your family, then perhaps we had better find something else for you to do.","I think the world would be much poorer without religion, speaking generally.","If every man would make his prime concern the comfort and well-being of his wife and every wife make her chief concern the comfort and well-being of her husband, we would have very little divorce in the land.","God gave us our agency. He taught us a way. He showed us what to do. But he gave us our agency and left us free to act as we choose to do.","I think that the churches do a better job in many respects than the government does in various kinds of things. Extending aid, the helpfulness, and so on, yes.","When all is said and done, the greatest satisfaction you'll have in this life as you grow old will be seeing your children grow in righteousness and faith and goodness as citizens of the society of which they are a part.","I spent one night in the hospital in my life. I was past 75 when that occurred.","I almost stand in awe when I think of Joseph Smith. The angel appeared to him in 1823 - he said to this simple little boy, 'Your name should be known for good and evil throughout the entire world.'","We're all sons and daughters of God, and therefore in a very literal sense, brothers and sisters. And we ought to treat each other that way.","We live in a world of shifting values. The family is falling apart. Parents failing in what they ought to do.","If there were no immortality there would be no need for temples. There would be no need for eternal marriage if there were no eternity.","You don't need coffee. Nobody needs coffee. You can get along without it.","At the end of our lives, we step across the threshold or death and enter into a new and better world. I believe that. It's just that simple.","Every individual in the church is free to think as he pleases.","People seem to be looking for discipline in a topsy-turvy world.","It is not a mark of manhood to carelessly use the name of the Almighty or of His Beloved Son in a vain and flippant way, as many are prone to do.","Did you ever think that your body is holy? You are a child of God. Your body is His creation.","Let the Latter-day Saints be in their homes, teaching their families, reading the scriptures, doing things that are wholesome and beautiful and communing with the Lord on the Sabbath day.","There is a tendency in all of us to ask for better statistical performance. There is a tendency to impose quotas behind which usually lies imposition of pressure to achieve improved statistics.","I have yet to find a faithful tithe payer who cannot testify that in a very literal and wonderful way the windows of Heaven have been opened and blessings have been poured out upon him or her.","How grateful I am for the law of tithing. It is the Lord's law of finance.","If there were more temple work done in the Church, there would be less of selfishness, less of contention, less of demeaning others.","Eligibility for a temple recommend is not based on financial worth. That has nothing whatever to do with it. It is based on consistent personal behavior, on the goodness of one's life. It is not concerned with money matters, but rather with things of eternity.","I feel to invite women everywhere to rise to the great potential within you. I do not ask that you reach beyond your capacity. I hope you will not nag yourselves with thoughts of failure. I hope you will not try to set goals far beyond your capacity to achieve. I hope you will simply do what you can do in the best way you know.","The Almighty, if necessary, may have to shake the nations to humble them and cause them to listen to the servants of the living God. Whatever is needed will come to pass.","With small means the Lord accomplishes His marvelous work.","We cannot be unclean and expect the help of the Almighty.","Every convert is a son or daughter of God.","There is no substitute for marrying in the temple.","There is nothing we could do of greater importance than to have fortified in our individual lives an unshakable conviction that Jesus is the Christ, the living Son of the living God.","Pray in faith.","I submit that in the few minutes that Joseph Smith was with the Father and the Son, he learned more of the nature of God the Eternal Father and the risen Lord than all the learned minds in all their discussions through all centuries of time.","My heart reaches out to you missionaries. You simply cannot do it alone and do it well. You must have the help of others. That power to help lies within each of us.","The gospel is not a philosophy of repression, as so many regard it. It is a plan of freedom that gives discipline to appetite and direction to behavior.","My heart goes out to a missionary who does not receive regular mail from home. Generally, a letter once a week is a good rule. But on the other hand, too much mail can be damaging to a missionary's morale.","Anything so precious as the gospel of Jesus Christ is worthy of all the effort and sacrifice of time and means employed to teach it.","Be virtuous in thought and in deed. God has planted in you, for a purpose, a divine urge which may be easily subverted to evil and destructive ends.","When you are young, do not get involved in steady dating. When you reach an age where you think of marriage, then is the time to become so involved.","The world is starved for spiritual food.","Small aberrations in doctrinal teaching can lead to large and evil falsehoods.","Let every mother realize that she has no greater blessing than the children who have come to her as a gift from the Almighty; that she has no greater mission than to rear them in light and truth, in understanding and love.","Sister Hinckley and I are learning that the so-called golden years are laced with lead.","I would enjoy sitting in a rocker... listening to soft music and contemplating the things of the universe. But such activity offers no challenge and makes no contribution.","We have come to Earth in this great season in the long history of mankind. It is a marvelous age - the best of all.","Determine that there will never be anything that will come between you that will disrupt your marriage. Make it work. Resolve to make it work.","There is far too much of divorce, wherein hearts are broken, and sometimes lives are destroyed.","In missionary work, as in all else, preparation precedes power. Encouragement to prepare while still very young can make a tremendous difference.","The most persuasive gospel tract is the exemplary life of a faithful Latter-day Saint.","We do not wonder that there is conflict in the world. There is now, and has been from the time that Cain slew Abel, so much of hatred.","Where ever the spirit of Christ is known, there is much of good will, of mutual respect, of love and appreciation and kindness.","As we give presents at Christmas, we need to recognize that sharing our time and ourselves is such an important part of giving.","The major work of the world is not done by geniuses. It is done by ordinary people, with balance in their lives, who have learned to work in an extraordinary manner.","Truth will prevail.","You will find peace and happiness if you will live the gospel.","Fear comes not from God but from the evil one.","I cannot understand why any young man - or young woman, for that matter - would wish to undergo the painful process of disfiguring the skin with various multicolored representations of people, animals, and various symbols.","I hope that if you are employed full-time, you are doing it to ensure that basic needs are met and not simply to indulge a taste for an elaborate home, fancy cars, and other luxuries.","The Savior of all mankind left the ninety and nine to find the one lost. That one who was lost need not have become lost.","When the 'Book of Mormon' was first published, some of those who believed in it taught it to others and testified of it.","There is dissatisfaction among a great many Christian people. They are not happy with what they have and, therefore, respond readily to the message of the restored gospel.","The biggest challenge facing a missionary today is to forget himself and lose himself in the work.","We are all prone to be a little selfish, a little lazy.","I have many friends of other religions, and I am satisfied that they are very conscientious, good people who are trying to do good. I appreciate that.","Teach your daughters to walk in virtue.","Encourage your children to read more and watch television less.","Seek to establish an environment conducive to study in the home.","Nothing's too good for the Lord.","Oh, I don't think religion has failed. It's man who has failed. Christ hasn't failed. The Gospel hasn't failed. The teachings of God have not failed.","I've been blessed so abundantly that I can never get over it. I just feel so richly blessed that I want to extend that to others wherever I can.","I have two sons. Good sons. They're both businessmen.","In the underdeveloped countries, we have young men and women, many of them of capacity but without opportunity to improve themselves. They cannot do so without help.","When you touch the life of a man of this generation, that influence is felt through generations yet to come.","Today is a part of eternity.","I thank the Lord for the great principle of repentance and forgiveness.","The Lord is forgiving, but sometimes life is not forgiving.","It is difficult for me to understand the tragic accounts of troubled marriages that come to me.","Some husbands regard it as their prerogative to compel their wives to fit their standards of what they think to be the ideal.","Until I got older, I never dreamed of what a demanding responsibility it is to keep food in the pantry, to keep clothing neat and presentable, to buy all that is needed to keep a home running.","My children are now all grown. Some are in their 60s. But when they call and I answer the phone, they say, 'How are you?' And before I can answer, they ask, 'Is Mother there?'","If you are a good missionary, you will return home with the desire to continue to serve the Lord, to keep His commandments, and to do His will.","A nation will rise no higher than the strength of its homes.","We all exercise agency in the choices we make.","Brigham Young had a prophetic vision.","I've tried to recognize my wife's individuality, her personality, her desires, her background, her ambitions.","My wife once said that one of her great ambitions was to walk down the streets of Hong Kong with her children. So we all went to Asia on one occasion. Then she said she'd like to walk down the streets of Jerusalem with her children. So we arranged our family finances and all went to Jerusalem.","Children can be disciplined with love.","I've never been a believer in the physical punishment of children. I don't think it is necessary.","Keep your families close together, and love and honor your children."],"Gordon Banks":["At that level, every goal is like a knife in the ribs.","That save from Pele's header was the best I ever made. I didn't have any idea how famous it would become - to start with, I didn't even realise I'd made it at all."],"Gordon Bell":["People have no memory of phone numbers now because of the cell phone - their address book is in a cell phone.","Well, I got to have a project. I'm not a blue-sky guy at all. I'd never let anybody like me loose in a company.","My mother had been a grade-school teacher, and my father had an eighth-grade education.","I started working occasionally for my father when I was around six. The first skill I learned was how to join a plug to a wire.","I tend to always carry a camera with me. I live next to a fire station, and I've got lots of photos of the hook and ladder coming out of the house. And I like food, so I tend to photograph wonderfully presented food all the time. To me those are very pleasant memories.","I'm on Facebook and Twitter, and occasionally I will tweet something. Somehow my problem is that I don't think I have anything interesting to tweet about.","I don't think forgetting is an important feature of human memory. I think it's important to be able to remember things accurately."],"Gordon Bethune":["Watches are the only jewelry men can wear, unless you're Mr. T.","It really helps to know what success is before you get there, and if you know, then you can head right for it. For some people, it's the most money. For some, it's the most power. For some, it's the most girlfriends. Everybody's got a measure. For me, I guess it's having the respect and admiration of your peers.","When you actually take the time to go over to somebody's office and personally thank them - whether their office is in a cockpit of an airplane, or in a break room - that's an actual manifestation of interest in them. You need to take the time to show the people around you who work for you that you're interested in them.","Every pilot thinks they're the best pilot in the world. I think I'm the best pilot.","No one is going to stick their head out of the trenches for someone they don't respect or trust. You can get shot doing that.","It's the old adage: You can make a pizza so cheap, nobody will eat it. You can make an airline so cheap, nobody will fly it.","I was a mechanic in the Navy. And mechanics in the Navy are like mechanics in airlines. You may have more stripes than I do, but you don't know how to fix the airplane.","I've spent my life as an airplane mechanic, pilot, aircraft manufacturer and airline CEO who never lost a life or an airplane. I am considerate of the risk we take every time we fly. I also know we need to fly and always to improve safety.","I learned that you can be successful if you get people to help you become successful.","The airline business is the biggest team sport in the world. When you're all consumed with fighting among yourselves, your opponents can run over you every day.","The substitute for knowledge is money.","It's not about market share. If you have a successful company, you will get your market share. But to get a successful company, what do you have to have? The same metrics of success that your customer does.","What you measure and reward is what you're going to get.","Most businesses fail because they want the right things but measure the wrong things, and they get the wrong results.","Somebody who knows what they're doing, who has a good track record, they come across as very articulate, bright and looking for a challenge - that's absolutely my kind of hire.","You don't lie to your own doctor. You don't lie to your own attorney, and you don't lie to your employees.","You're only as good as your dumbest competitor.","The guy in the airplane goes with you. So he has self-interest to do the good things, too, and I don't know of any pilots that don't have a self-interest in staying alive.","We tax air passengers like cigarettes and alcohol - we impose sin taxes on travellers.","I just want to be able to get on an airplane and enjoy myself in Disneyland, not sit there worrying about all these assassins.","There is no economy without airlines. Airfreight runs the world. There is no Honolulu without an airplane. This is a very complex system. If you take it down, you can't build it back up overnight.","It's difficult to have everybody like everything you do. I don't know anybody that's perfect and doesn't have a zit somewhere.","Grounding airplanes to cover your butt would never have let Orville or Wilbur change the world. We would still be spending weeks to cross the Atlantic to do business in London.","Whether I'm at the hangar or at the airport or on an airplane, I get respect. And that's the best part of my day.","A bankruptcy judge can fix your balance sheet, but he cannot fix your company.","It all sounds almost silly, but the fact is that the only way to change a corporate culture is to just change it.","If you say three things in a row that make sense, people will vote for you."],"Gordon Brown":["I'm a father; that's what matters most. Nothing matters more.","I hate prejudice, discrimination, and snobbishness of any kind - it always reflects on the person judging and not the person being judged. Everyone should be treated equally.","The motto of the old order in the City of London was, 'My word is my bond,' but the financial crisis revealed a culture quite alien to that heritage. The stewards of people's money were revealed to have been speculators with it.","When something really matters, you should never give up or give in.","Globalisation feels like a runaway train, out of control.","In a global marketplace with its increased insecurities and - indeed often - volatility and instability, national economic stability is at a premium, the precondition for all we can achieve, and no nation can secure the high levels of sustainable investment it needs without both monetary and fiscal stability together.","Climate change is a consequence of the build up of greenhouse gases over the past 200 years in the atmosphere, and virtually all these emissions came from the rich countries.","You need in the long run for stability, for economic growth, for jobs, as well as for financial stability, global economic institutions that make sure that growth to be sustained has to be shared, and are built on the principle that the prosperity of this world is indivisible.","Take, therefore, what modern technology is capable of: the power of our moral sense allied to the power of communications and our ability to organize internationally. That, in my view, gives us the first opportunity as a community to fundamentally change the world.","We need quantitative assessments of the success of education. We need certification and qualifications both for teachers and for pupils. It is not a choice between quantity and quality, between access and excellence. Both of these will happen together if people really do believe in the importance of education to change lives.","Turing was a quite brilliant mathematician, most famous for his work on breaking the German Enigma codes. It is no exaggeration to say that, without his outstanding contribution, the history of the Second World War could have been very different.","I'm a great supporter of the European Union. I didn't support entry to the Euro, not because I'm against it in principle but because I didn't think it was economically right for Britain. But that doesn't make me any less pro-European.","I am not going to the House of Lords. Never. That's not who I am. That's not where I am.","If our economies are to flourish, if global poverty is to be banished, and if the wellbeing of the world's people enhanced - not just in this generation but in succeeding generations - we must make sure we take care of the natural environment and resources on which our economic activity depends.","Higher energy prices are requiring industry and commerce to examine the costs and efficiency of energy use.","The growing evidence of climate change is forcing attention on carbon emissions and their reduction.","When I lost the sight of my eye and faced the prospect of going blind, my sight was saved by the NHS.","Collective European Union action could mean no hiding places for evaders, no safe haven for tax avoiders, and no treasure islands for money launderers.","People believe in the power of education to change lives.","Our ability to connect as a nation with other nations around the world is enhanced dramatically by the Internet.","It will not be a surprise to you to learn I'm more interested in the future of the Arctic Circle than the future of the Arctic Monkeys.","In 2005 we have a once in a generation opportunity to deliver a modern Marshall plan for the developing world.","We spend more on cows than the poor.","Britain can be proud of its response to the tsunami appeal.","Each year India and China produce four million graduates compared with just over 250,000 in Britain.","America knows it has got to deal with its deficit problems so that it, too, can promise it is making its proper and best contributions to the world economy.","Britain should be the world's number one center for genetic and stem cell research, building on our world leading regulatory regime in the area.","There is nothing that you could say to me now that I could ever believe.","I believe there is a moral sense and a global ethic that commands attention from people of every religion and every faith, and people of no faith. But I think what's new is that we now have the capacity to communicate instantaneously across frontiers right across the world.","So another challenge for our generation is to create global institutions that reflect our ideas of fairness and responsibility, not the ideas that were the basis of the last stage of financial development over these recent years.","We must then build a proper relationship between the richest and the poorest countries based on our desire that they are able to fend for themselves with the investment that is necessary in their agriculture, so that Africa is not a net importer of food, but an exporter of food.","We are being tough in saying it is a duty on the unemployed in future not only to be available for work - and not to shirk work - but also to get the skills for work. That is a new duty we are introducing.","I don't see politics as one or two people just making or delivering announcements - it's also about winning public support and the public enthusiasm. You've got to win public support.","In Britain, we are not a secular state as France is, or some other countries.","When you've got a society that is diverse, what happens is for a time, the issue is integrating your minorities into that society.","Stability is necessary for our future economic success.","The British economy of the future must be built not on the shifting sands of boom and bust, but on the bedrock of prudent and wise economic management for the long term. It is only these firm foundations that we can raise Britain's underlying economic performance.","The way forward is for governments to consciously pursue monetary and fiscal stability through setting clear objectives, establishing proper rules, and requiring openness and transparency - the new rules of the game.","I want to do something for Kirkcaldy and Fife. I am a full-time MP, not a businessman.","Other prime ministers leave office and stay in London. I have come back with my whole family to Fife. This is where they are being brought up. It is better for them and better for me. It's great to see more of the kids.","You have to live in the future, not the past.","In every era, there are only one or two moments when nations come together and reach agreements that make history, because they change the course of history.","The extraordinary summer heatwave of 2003 in Europe resulted in over 35,000 extra deaths.","We cannot compromise with the earth; we cannot compromise with the catastrophe of unchecked climate change, so we must compromise with one another.","The Britain I know is the Britain of Jo Cox. The Britain where people are tolerant and not prejudiced, and where people hate hate.","I never subscribed to what you might call the neo-Conservative position that somehow, at the barrel of a gun, overnight, liberty and democracy could be conjured up.","I love Scotland; I love the NHS. I was born into the NHS; I grew up in the NHS. My family grew up in the NHS.","Do you think that I or anybody else who cares about the NHS would stand by and do nothing if we thought the NHS was going to be privatised in Scotland and its funds were going to be cut? Would we stand back and do nothing without a fight? Of course not.","The NHS cannot be privatised if that's not the will of the Scottish people, and the Scottish health service will have the funding that's necessary if that's also the will of the Scottish people.","Markets need morals.","Christians do not say that people should be reduced merely to what they can produce or what they can buy - that we should let the weak go under and only the strong survive. No, we say, 'Do to others what you would have them do unto you.'","Getting married has certainly made a massive difference to my own life. So I am committed to giving support for family finances and having the right policies for work-life balance that make it easier for couples to have a rich family life.","Our common realm is not and cannot be stripped of values - I absolutely reject the idea that religion should somehow be tolerated but not encouraged in public life.","I welcome the role that people of faith play in building Britain's future - and the Catholic communion in particular is to be congratulated for so often being the conscience of our country, for helping 'the least of these' even when bearing witness to the truth is hard or unpopular.","Our equality bill is specifically designed to protect religion and belief on exactly the same terms as race or gender or sexuality.","Why is playing football in Europe considered the pinnacle of our game, yet in other spheres of life, that same phrase - 'being in Europe' - is dismissed with suspicion?","We must understand that the British public's relationship with Europe is - and always has been, the sporting arena aside - about the benefits we can achieve in jobs, security, and quality of life from membership and how these benefits outweigh any disadvantages.","We should demonstrate that in war, under Churchill and Lloyd George, and in peace, Britain always was, already is, and can continue to be a leader.","Britain must lead in Europe to intensify the fight against global terrorism and make our country safer.","I am a father with young kids, and you want to know the jobs in the future are going to be there.","I think fathers, mothers, grandfathers, grandmothers - we should look at what young people are saying to us.","Nigel Farage wanted to privatise the health service. Nigel Farage does not believe in the values we believe in for our public services.","The patriotism in Britain comes from us being a leader. On jobs, on tax havens, on workers' rights, on the environment. We can be leading Europe... and it will be to the benefit of every British citizen.","I have to say that if our global alliances are going to be alliances with Hezbollah and Hamas and Hugo Chavez's Venezuela and Vladimir Putin's Russia, there is absolutely no chance of building a world-wide alliance that can deal with poverty and inequality and climate change and financial instability, and we've got to face up to that fact.","The best way of realising our high ideals is to show that we have an alternative in government that is credible, that is radical, and is electable - is neither a pale imitation of what the Tories offer nor is it the route to being a party of permanent protest rather than a party of government.","It is not a mistake to want power.","I believe that our vote is both a public duty and a sacred trust.","Let us think of ourselves not as 'yes' and 'no' Scots but simply as Scots, and let us be a nation, united again.","What is happened in the years since the Second World War is not a temporary truce. It is not simply a ceasefire. Instead of battling with weapons and armaments, people battle only with arguments and ideas.","We've managed to find a way of making decisions that prevents conflict arising - there has been no war between European members at any point in the last 70 years.","You can't just vote for yourself. All the time, you're thinking what sort of country, what world, what future?","A woman said to me, 'You're better than your successor.' She then said she's lived under 10 prime ministers, and each was worse than the last. That put me in my place.","Every country is going to have to face up to globalisation, but Scotland has got a unique capacity because of its history as part of a multinational state to help us deal with that problem.","I've got a job to do.","When things are difficult, you have to be sure of who you are and what you want to achieve.","When people criticise you, you've got to listen to that criticism, and to learn from it, which I've tried to do.","You can drink too much tea.","I once wrote a book on courage and what made people courageous. I found it was a strength of belief matched by a strength of willpower."],"Gordon Cooper":["Father, we thank you, especially for letting me fly this flight - for the privilege of being able to be in this position, to be in this wondrous place, seeing all these many startling, wonderful things that you have created.","I believe that these extra-terrestrial vehicles and their crews are visiting this planet from other planets. Most astronauts were reluctant to discuss UFOs."],"Gordon England":["The president said that this is not removing a mole. You know, removing a mole, that's an outpatient sort of an operation. This was removing a cancer, removing a cancer takes more time.","This is a war against terrorists. Not a war against a religion, but a war against terrorists."],"Gordon Gee":["The arts, quite simply, nourish the soul. They sustain, comfort, inspire. There is nothing like that exquisite moment when you first discover the beauty of connecting with others in celebration of larger ideals and shared wisdom.","So if a college education is indispensable, the challenge as I see it is how to make it more accessible.","When the fabric of the universe becomes unknown, it is the duty of the university to produce weavers.","Poland not only has a capable military but also is strong economically and does not need money being raised for it.","I believe that it is higher education's purpose and calling to keep open the door to the American dream.","I believe we have the best football coach in the country in Urban Meyer. I had the privilege of hiring him, as you know, and I think he is doing fabulous work.","If we make a difference in Ohio, we can make a difference on a national scale.","Jewish students, by culture and by ability and by the very nature of their liveliness, make a university a much more habitable place in terms of intellectual life.","The universities of the 21st century are going to be the smokestacks of the century.","Intellectual curiosity drove Einstein to some of the world's most important discoveries.","Continue to surprise those who would put you in a neat demographic. Be insistently curious.","Being president of a major public university is the most political nonpolitical office around.","People look at me like I'm crazy when I say that our greatest partnership here at Ohio State should be with the community colleges.","I am a bit odd. I am somewhat evangelical. But I am not crazy.","I believe everything learned in college is an answer to a question that someone has posed. Questions get posed differently and the answers that come back transport us to places we never knew existed.","I am not a scientist. I have never analyzed the far reaches of the solar system through the lens of a telescope nor scrutinized cancer cells under a microscope.","I often have said that to be a college president, you need a thick skin, a good sense of humor, and nerves like sewer pipes.","As one of the country's largest land-grant universities, Ohio State must play a critical role in moving our country forward.","Founded when Abraham Lincoln believed education could lead the nation out of its darkest days, Ohio State now provides a powerful platform of interdisciplinary academic programs, world-class scholars, outstanding students, and extensive research capabilities.","I spent the first 18 years of my life in the pastoral town of Vernal, Utah, in the shadows of the Book Cliffs and the Uinta Mountains.","A truly great university is a nucleus of artistic expression. It fosters creative, critical thought, and serves as a platform for civil discourse.","The Ohio State University has a rich - if quiet - heritage of the arts.","College graduates work in every sector of the American economy, and the research engines incubated within our universities generate a wealth of ideas and innovations that have an enormous impact on our lives.","To be sure, American higher education is a diverse ecosystem, comprising institutions of all sizes, price tags, and mission statements.","Everyone wrote our obituary but us and the coaches and the kids who stayed with us. The obit was, 'Vanderbilt will have to leave the Southeastern Conference. All the coaches are leaving, and all the students are transferring.'","I think we can be competitive on and off the field and create a model where our athletes are scholars and learners, too.","I'm the seventh chancellor at Vanderbilt; Bobby Johnson is the 25th head football coach. That shows a lack of commitment to attract and retain.","I joke that being a university president is akin to being a pinata. But there are also notions of redemption.","At least for me, I believe that one learns from one's mistakes. And I made significant mistakes, and I learned from them.","You have great athletic directors, you let them run it; you keep yourself informed, but I'm not the athletic director. I'm the president of the university.","I think what any student adds is the ideas they bring.","We're going to make certain that we set a very high standard for ourselves.","In tumultuous times, it's important to have a very mature leader.","Every time I get a lot of money, I cry, and I got a lot of tears left.","Sitting on a corporate board is a hobby for me.","Let me just be very clear: I'm just hopeful the coach doesn't dismiss me.","I have a passion for academic life, a passion for students and for the ability and the narrative of a university to make a difference in the world in which they reside.","I did not want to go anywhere where I would be interim.","I am trying to prioritize and keep everything in balance, which for me is not easy.","I've been president of Brown and chancellor of Vanderbilt, where they have very high completion rates.","The strength of the American higher education system is that it is a multifaceted, multi-layered system, and that is what makes us very strong.","I think everyone needs to focus on the quality of the undergraduate experience.","We play very fine schools on any given day.","I got all sorts of great Nebraska jokes.","I'm probably one of most quotable guys in America.","My mouth is sore from continually extracting my foot from it.","In a very complex world, you can no longer expect everyone to be great at everything.","The notion of the large, massive public university that can exist in isolated splendor is dead.","I tend to deal with most issues with humor... always have and always will.","I simply take serious issues seriously, but I do not take myself seriously.","I love this university, and although I might be retiring from the presidency, my work with Ohio State will continue.","I believe being president of a private institution is a remarkable experience, but at Ohio State, it's a calling.","I believe that the future is determined by the great public universities. They educate 80 percent of the students and make the American Dream available.","What I should do is go over to the surgical suites and get my foot extricated from my mouth.","What do I know about college football? I look like Orville Redenbacher. I have no business talking about college football.","Online is ridiculous. Places like Ohio State bring people here together, and students teach each other."],"Gordon Getty":["I'm a terrible singer, but it helps when I have to call a taxi.","Both parents were very encouraging - especially my father. My father thought the sun rose and set with me. Neither one had a musical background or any musical talent. They liked classical music, but neither could carry a tune.","I want to make the world better.","I do not think that music keeps evolving. It evolved through Bach; since then, in my humble opinion, all the innovations added nothing.","Nicolette, Kendalle, and Alexandra are my children. Their mother, Cynthia Beck, and I, love them very much.","The Getty family has been fully supportive throughout this situation, and for that, I am very grateful.","When my opera Plump Jack was performed in 1989, my first piano teacher sent me something that I'd composed when I was four. I remember I played it, and it still sounded like me. I'm the same composer I was then.","I feel that I belong to the 19th century. Some composers' music is very topical. It almost says, 'This is about what I read in newspapers yesterday.' Not mine.","My music is all about an idealistic human personality. I have 19th-century ideals.","I don't think events in your life affect your music.","Either your understanding of the meaning of music is there from the beginning or it is not.","There is no change - I'm as deep or as shallow as I ever was. What's new is on-the-job experience. This is what you gain with years.","My father was so much more than an accomplished businessman.","I was in Paris at an English-language bookstore. I picked up a volume of Dickinson's poetry. I came back to my hotel, read 2,000 of her poems and immediately began composing in my head. I wrote down the melodies even before I got to a piano.","I see only adaptations - not revolutions.","I personally do not write highbrow music. If I do, it's by accident.","If you have more money than you need, you have to give it away. It's a duty. I get to choose whom to sponsor, and I like to give to the areas that I know something about.","It's true that I tend to daydream. I'm the same person in business as I am in music: I can be distracted and absentminded. It's my style.","I've managed to dodge the curse. Not all my family have. Of course, music helped me - music is all about civilization, about something worthwhile. It's all about ideas.","I just have to take my chances like any other composer.","I've had every advantage in the world, despite the 18 years of silence which were nobody's fault but mine."],"Gordon Gould":["But certainly the laser proved to be what I realized it was going to be. At that moment in my life I was too ignorant in business law to be able to do it right, and if I did it over again probably the same damn thing would happen.","I would have had my patent long, long ago, and it would have run out long, long ago. I would have made, maybe, $100.000, much less that the patent has brought me now.","Just think, if I had understood my lawyer and if he and I had communicated properly in January 1958, this whole history would have been entirely different .","That attitude does not exist so much today, but in those days there was a very sharp distinction between basic physics and applied physics. Columbia did not deal with applied physics.","The real technical problems came because people working on the project didn't really follow my proposal at all, but set out to do other things instead of making a laser.","There was a second problem that was still not a technical problem... the project became classified. I couldn't work on it after having gone to all that trouble. I was considered a security risk, so I could not get a clearance."],"Gordon Lightfoot":["You just get the vibes of your surroundings and it rubs off on you.","I don't think they should regulate the music field. I don't see how they can regulate the arts.","Turning back the pages of my sweet shattered dream, I wonder if she'll ever do the same; And the thing that I call living is just being satisfied With knowing I've got no one left to blame.","All that remains is the faces and the names of the wives and the sons and the daughters.","I'm not really a bird person or an Audubon guy who studies them, but as I was around them, they interested me.","I try to keep it light and positive most of the time, whereas earlier on I didn't always do that.","I know that we're being inexorably taken over by the Americans. Without a doubt. I don't mean invaded or anything like that, just taken over. By degrees."],"Gordon Moore":["With engineering, I view this year's failure as next year's opportunity to try it again. Failures are not something to be avoided. You want to have them happen as quickly as you can so you can make progress rapidly.","The technology at the leading edge changes so rapidly that you have to keep current after you get out of school. I think probably the most important thing is having good fundamentals.","I remember the difficulty we had in the beginning replacing magnetic cores in memories and eventually we had both cost and performance advantages. But it wasn't at all clear in the beginning.","It is extremely unlikely that anyone coming out of school with a technical degree will go into one area and stay there. Today's students have to look forward to the excitement of probably having three or four careers."],"Gordon Neufeld":["Many people think that discipline is the essence of parenting. But that isn't parenting. Parenting is not telling your child what to do when he or she misbehaves. Parenting is providing the conditions in which a child can realize his or her full human potential.","We have lost sight of nature's role in the whole process of maturation and growing up. Parents and nature are a team. And nature can't go on without the parental role of being able to foster individuality and viability unless the attachment needs are fully met.","Peer attachments are not the problem themselves. It's when they compete with adult attachments that the problems emerge. It's just like when siblings get attached to each other. If they start revolving around each other, then the parents can't do anything with them because it's a competing attachment.","It is a parent's responsibility to preserve the connection with their children, to preserve the relationship, so that the children can let go and become their own selves.","Digital intimacy ruins the appetite for the real thing. So, when kids are gaming or even when spouses are gaming, they lose their appetite for genuine intimacy. Kids lose their appetite for getting their intimacy needs, their hunger for significance and attachment, with the family, and it erodes the relationship between them and their parents.","I started my career in parent education with the idea that we needed to let our kids go. I believed that parents were suffocating for their children. There was no room for individuality and personhood.","Children need to trust and depend upon those who are responsible for them.","Parents are the designated caregivers and are best suited for being able to raise children."],"Gordon Parks":["You know, the camera is not meant just to show misery.","There's another horizon out there, one more horizon that you have to make for yourself and let other people discover it, and someone else will take it further on, you know.","The subject matter is so much more important than the photographer.","I suffered evils, but without allowing them to rob me of the freedom to expand.","I bought my first camera in Seattle, Washington. Only paid about seven dollars and fifty cents for it.","At first I wasn't sure that I had the talent, but I did know I had a fear of failure, and that fear compelled me to fight off anything that might abet it.","People in millenniums ahead will know what we were like in the 1930's and the thing that, the important major things that shaped our history at that time. This is as important for historic reasons as any other.","I've been with Life now for seventeen years and I have written several articles for them and will be doing more writing and do at least two assignments a year besides my writing.","But I do feel a little teeny right now that I'm just about ready to start, and winter is entering. Half past autumn has arrived.","And now, I feel at 85, I really feel that I'm just ready to start.","The photographer begins to feel big and bloated and so big he can't walk through one of these doors because he gets a good byline; he gets notices all over the world and so forth; but they're really - the important people are the people he photographs.","Washington, D.C. in 1942 was not the easiest place in the world for a Negro to get along.","And I think that after nearly 85 years upon this planet that I have a right after working so hard at showing the desolation and the poverty, to show something beautiful for somebody as well.","But I was very disappointed that I didn't get a chance to go overseas with that group, might not have gotten back but I wanted very much to go because there's not much of a record of the exploits of the first Negro fighter group.","I think maybe the rural influence in my life helped me in a sense, of knowing how to get close to people and talk to them and get my work done.","I was there less than a year before I was assigned to the Paris bureau. I spent two years there and, in fact, before I even went on the staff I was sent to Europe to do assignments which they wouldn't normally do for a young photographer just starting out.","I'd become sort of involved in things that were happening to people. No matter what color they be, whether they be Indians, or Negroes, the poor white person or anyone who was I thought more or less getting a bad shake.","So I went to Chicago in 1940, I think, '41, and the photographs that I made there, aside from fashion, were things that I was trying to express in a social conscious way.","The man at Kodak told me the shots were very good and if I kept it up, they would give me an exhibition. Later, Kodak gave me my first exhibition."],"Gordon Ramsay":["I don't like looking back. I'm always constantly looking forward. I'm not the one to sort of sit and cry over spilt milk. I'm too busy looking for the next cow.","If you want to become a great chef, you have to work with great chefs. And that's exactly what I did.","Cooking is about passion, so it may look slightly temperamental in a way that it's too assertive to the naked eye.","If I can give you one strong piece of advice, when you go away for that romantic weekend, whatever you do, do not accept or take the upgrade to the honeymoon suite.","I am what I am. A fighter.","The minute you start compromising for the sake of massaging somebody's ego, that's it, game over.","Swearing is industry language. For as long as we're alive it's not going to change. You've got to be boisterous to get results.","I'm Gordon Ramsay, for goodness sake: people know I'm volatile.","I cook, I create, I'm incredibly excited by what I do, I've still got a lot to achieve.","There's a bond among a kitchen staff, I think. You spend more time with your chef in the kitchen than you do with your own family.","The pressure on young chefs today is far greater than ever before in terms of social skills, marketing skills, cooking skills, personality and, more importantly, delivering on the plate. So you need to be strong. Physically fit. So my chefs get weighed every time they come into the kitchen.","Chefs are nutters. They're all self-obsessed, delicate, dainty, insecure little souls and absolute psychopaths. Every last one of them.","I've had a lot of success; I've had failures, so I learn from the failure.","Kitchens are hard environments and they form incredibly strong characters.","When you find a guy who is powerful, a big father figure, you latch onto him immediately.","I act on impulse and I go with my instincts.","I swim like a fish and I have an amazing kick.","As a soccer player, I wanted an FA Cup winner's medal. As an actor you want an Oscar. As a chef it's three-Michelin's stars, there's no greater than that. So pushing yourself to the extreme creates a lot of pressure and a lot of excitement, and more importantly, it shows on the plate.","I want my kids to see me as Dad, for God's sake, not a television personality.","I mean, families are weird.","No one saw the recession coming.","I train my chefs completely different to anyone else. My young girls and guys, when they come to the kitchen, the first thing they get is a blindfold. They get blindfolded and they get sat down at the chef's table... Unless they can identify what they're tasting, they don't get to cook it.","You don't come into cooking to get rich.","I suppose your security is your success and your key to success is your fine palate.","I've never been a hands-on dad. I'm not ashamed to admit it, but you can't run a restaurant and be home for tea at 4:30 and bath and change nappies.","When you cook under pressure you trade perfection.","I'm quite a chauvinistic person.","When you're a chef, you graze. You never get a chance to sit down and eat. They don't actually sit down and eat before you cook. So when I finish work, the first thing I'll do, and especially when I'm in New York, I'll go for a run. And I'll run 10 or 15k on my - and I run to gain my appetite.","I am the most unselfish chef in Britain today.","It's very hard when you eat out every day for a living, and a new restaurant comes along and you haven't got that same vigour that you had 10 years ago.","You know how arrogant the French are - extraordinary.","They say cats have nine lives. I've had 12 already and I don't know how many more I'll have.","Find what's hot, find what's just opened and then look for the worst review of the week. There is so much to learn from watching a restaurant getting absolutely panned and having a bad experience. Go and see it for yourself.","I don't run restaurants that are out of control. We are about establishing phenomenal footholdings with talent.","We are about creating a new wave of talent. We are the Manchester United of kitchens now. Am I playing full-time in the kitchen? I am a player-coach.","My wife, a schoolteacher, very disciplined. If you think I'm tough, trust me, and wait till you see when the children are on the naughty step. It's hilarious. So we decided that I'm going to work like a donkey and provide amazing support for the family.","I am a chef who happens to appear on the telly, that's it.","Cooking today is a young man's game, I don't give a bollocks what anyone says.","I am a grafter.","I think every chef, not just in America, but across the world, has a double-edged sword - two jackets, one that's driven, a self-confessed perfectionist, thoroughbred, hate incompetence and switch off the stove, take off the jacket and become a family man.","It's vulgar, coming from where I do, to talk about money.","I didn't get depressed, I don't get depressed.","I'm not trying to take New York by storm. I just want to sneak in there, keep my head down, batten down the hatches and cook.","I don't think it's a good advert for any restaurant, a fat chef, and secondly, who wants to eat a dessert when the chef's a fat pig.","I came up from a difficult background.","Running started as a way of relaxing. It's the only time I have to myself. No phones or e-mails or faxes.","I'd like to think I'm a great teacher.","The problem with Yanks is they are wimps.","I hid myself in food.","If I relaxed, if I took my foot off the gas, I would probably die.","I was a naturally aggressive left-back, a cut-throat tackler.","I still love football, though, and I think cooking is like football. It's not a job, it's a passion. When you become good at it, it's a dream job and financially you need never to worry. Ever.","Would I swap what I have achieved as a cook if I could have been as successful as a footballer? Definitely.","There is a level of snobbery and fickleness in L.A.","I won't let people write anything they want to about me.","I grew up in a funny way.","My father was a swim teacher. We used to swim before school, swim after school.","I shoot from the hip.","I'm not critic-proof, and I still take it personally, but I take it less personally now.","I've got nothing to hide."],"Gordon Richards":["I can't remember ever being told how to ride.","I just got on a pony's back and away I went."],"Gordon Sinclair":["As long as sixty years ago, when I first started to read newspapers, I read of floods on the Yellow River and the Yangtze. Who rushed in with men and money to help? The Americans did.","Can you name me even one time when someone else raced to the Americans in trouble? I don't think there was outside help even during the San Francisco earthquake.","Even the draft dodgers are not pursued and hounded. They are here on our streets, most of them... unless they are breaking Canadian laws .. are getting American dollars from Ma and Pa at home to spend here.","Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and Italy, were lifted out of the debris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of dollars and forgave other billions in debts.","I can name to you 5,000 times when the Americans raced to the help of other people in trouble.","So far this spring, 59 American communities have been flattened by tornadoes. Nobody has helped.","The United States dollar took another pounding on German, French and British exchanges this morning, hitting the lowest point ever known in West Germany.","Today, the rich bottom land of the Misssissippi is under water and no foreign land has sent a dollar to help.","When the franc was in danger of collapsing in 1956, it was the Americans who propped it up and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the streets of Paris. I was there. I saw it.","When the railways of France, Germany and India were breaking down through age, it was the Americans who rebuilt them.","You talk about American technocracy and you find men on the moon, not once, but several times... and safely home again.","You talk about German technocracy and you get automobiles.","You talk about Japanese technocracy and you get radios.","You talk about scandals and the Americans put theirs right in the store window for everyone to look at."],"Gordon Smith":["I think I have over 60 apps on my iPhone. I use six.","We take our kids for physical vaccinations, dental exams, eye checkups. When do we think to take our - our son or daughter for a mental health checkup?","We have some control over when we retire. However, we have very little control over how long we will live.","A lot of things people see as innovative are faddish and fleeting, and I'm simply telling you, staying power like broadcasting has is more important in the end than the latest app you can download.","Newspapers across the country and the world have published cartoons that have gone beyond reasonable differences of opinion and expanded into the realm of antisemitism.","The only way to ensure that our promise to provide every opportunity for students with disabilities, and help them achieve their full potential, is to give our schools the dollars they need.","As a Republican, I voted with President Clinton consistently in our efforts to bail out our European friends in Kosovo to stop genocide. I am proud of those votes. I am proud of President Clinton for that.","I have concluded that the U.N. can do a few things well.","We have a rare and perhaps small window of opportunity to set partisan differences aside, and attempt to achieve what many in recent years have felt was unreachable - greater retirement security for ourselves and our children.","In my day, the players used to work their socks off. It's all changed now, obviously.","My neighbor is now an 18-wheeler who comes by here 1,000 times a day.","The American people are being victimized more than any free market would warrant.","On issues carrying as much emotional freight as race - and there aren't many - a U.S. senator needs to speak with care and consistency. Otherwise, he could find people speaking at his own retirement tribute.","My mother always said, 'The best way to ruin a story is to tell the other side.'","The people who depend on an antenna are often those who are underprivileged - the elderly and the disadvantaged who can't afford a $200-a-month cable bill.","Radio continues to be the very best advertising music performers have. No one who ever grabbed a Grammy got there without radio.","I wish there were a healthier Republican Party in the state of Oregon.","I never thought Oregon would elect to the U.S. Senate a Mormon, but it did.","For years, broadcasters didn't get a nickel out of retransmission consent. But broadcast content is what the cable industry was selling to customers.","Business deals are successfully negotiated every day throughout America. The common thread is a mutual desire to reach an accord. And the media business is no different.","History shows that pay-TV subscribers flee in droves to alternative providers when there is even a rare service disruption - demonstrating a quantifiable value for 'must-have' broadcast programming.","If policymakers are serious about avoiding a society of TV 'haves and have-nots,' they should refrain from policies that favor pay-TV operators over the providers of our nation's only free and local communications system: over-the-air broadcasting.","Pay-TV companies that built their businesses on the backs of local and network broadcast signals should pay a fair price for access to that high-value programming.","Mitt Romney has a proven job creation record as governor and in the private sector.","Lawmakers have good reason to want a healthy broadcast industry. Broadcast TV stations provide more than 186,000 jobs on an annual basis, which directly generate more than $30 billion in economic activity.","When there's an emergency weather situation, the local broadcaster is the source of information that often makes the difference between life and death.","Broadcasting's best days lie ahead as both an engine of local economies and as an integral part of tomorrow's technological world.","Local television is still the No. 1 source for news and part of the family."],"Gordon Strachan":["I've got more important things to think about. I've got a yogurt to finish by today, the expiry date is today.","I'm just going to crumble like a wreck. I'll go home, become an alcoholic and maybe! jump of a bridge.","I've been in football a long time and people have problems through debt, drugs, drink and family.","People think I've got a problem with the press. Actually I have no problem with the press, but just like in football there are a handful who cause problems because they're disrespectful, they're lazy, and above all - and this is what really gets to me - they haven't worked hard to get there.","It took me 35 years of being involved at a decent level of football to become manager at a great club like Celtic.","I like to be able to control which players I'm working with. Because it doesn't matter how good a coach you are if the guys you're working with think they already know it all. You need a response, you need to feel they're trying. I want players who are always striving to improve.","I get the feeling a lot of politicians are there to help themselves financially, first and foremost. I don't really need to do that, and I thought if I could do something for sport in Scotland, that would be really fulfilling.","Do I miss football in Scotland? It keeps you really alive, that's for sure. Your heartbeat fluctuates. I'm flatlining at the moment which is actually quite nice but you need to go up and down to stay alive.","I did think there were one or two referees who had a personal thing against me. It wasn't them versus Celtic - it was them against me! I just think they wanted to take me on.","I've had to take a lot of stick down the years but the one thing that really got to me was when someone questioned my integrity. It's the one thing that really grates with you.","Sometimes to go forward you've got to go to the depths of your own personal despair and claw yourself back. From that point, no matter what happens, you know you can do it.","I've seen teams spend £150 million and get nowhere near the Champions League. It has taken Manchester City a billion to get there. There are no guarantees.","I'm a better coach now than when I joined Celtic. The longer you stay in any job, the better you become. If you lose your drive, your enthusiasm, your imagination, that experience is no good.","The reason I became a manager was to have full control over training. If you are a coach, you are bound by what the manager wants you to coach. The other reason is that I just like the company of football people.","Fitness is a curve. You can be Lance Armstrong, or you can be really out of shape at the opposite end. People enter the curve wherever they are and then they can move up the curve, by better nutrition and better exercise.","I think what I've actually achieved as a manager does sometimes get a bit overlooked, because all people think about is the media side of things. They tend to forget I've not done so bad.","I want players who are always striving to improve.","I get the feeling a lot of politicians are there to help themselves financially, first and foremost.","Believe me, you need good people if you want to make good players.","I'm afraid that this is me getting on my high horse now but we have yob television, yob newspapers, and funny enough whereas it was my mum and dad, school, police, church who used to set the standards, now it's tabloids and yob television who set the standards by which people live.","All the really good players I know, they all knew right from wrong. So many of them don't learn that at home nowadays.","People talk about footballers and they get a bad press when not all of them deserve it.","You need responsibility in life."],"Gordon Taylor":["The Football Association have always acted more as a referee than a governor. And the FA, aware the Premier League provide players for the England team, have always had too gentle a hand on the tiller. The result is that the Premier League are the tigers in the English football jungle everybody's scared of.","Footballers are an easy target. They are offered big lines of credit. Every sport is vulnerable; it's such a big gambling industry, and there are problems with syndicates in other countries.","We are trying to educate players to use their spare time to train for a life after football, which comes to everybody. You can lead a lot of horses to water, but you can't make them all drink.","You don't hear a film director saying 'Money mustn't go out of the industry' to actors. You don't hear a concert promoter saying 'We must make sure that money doesn't go out of our industry' to Elton John. Some people in football seem to think, 'Never mind the players, let's get on with the game.'","There are people who enjoy the life in England but don't pay a penny in tax, whereas my footballers pay more than half their income in tax.","Manchester United and Liverpool have been bought with huge leverage, and we've got Roman Abramovich at Chelsea who can turn his loans into shares. It is really important for the Premier League to ask itself: if a club is being bought on such a mountain of debt, isn't that a possible recipe for disaster for the future?","Footballers are the most vulnerable people. They exude confidence, but inside, they're so lacking in confidence. They know they can lose form or be injured. This profession is so insecure, you wouldn't believe it.","David Beckham is a patriot, and I am sure he will help in any way he can. Beckham needs to be part of any future plans to remould the England set-up. Beckham and players like him need to be integrated into the set-up in the same way that the Germans take on board former players from Beckenbauer to Rummenigge.","I know so many players who say they wouldn't entertain coaching, until they retire that is, and then they want to take their coaching badges. I suspect this might happen with David Beckham.","In politics, they found there were not enough females in the House of Commons, so they came up with the idea of shortlists having to have women on them.","The whole object of the players' association is to try and make sure that any individual is able to capitalise on his ability, particularly in football, which is a very short career.","Every person has got the right to speak in public so long as it is their own point of view and it does not reflect badly on their employers, the game or other personalities in the game.","Football has to work really hard to put a smile on people's face and not to be so focused on the question of money. Everything is in danger of losing its soul if you're always going to sell out to the highest bidder.","Footballers are kept in such a bubble that horse racing is a release."],"Gordon W. Allport":["We cannot know the young child's personality by studying his systems of interest, for his attention is as yet too labile, his reactions impulsive, and interests unformed. From adolescence onward, however, the surest clue to personality is the hierarchy of interests, including the loves and loyalties of adult life.","The outlines of the needed psychology of becoming can be discovered by looking within ourselves; for it is knowledge of our own uniqueness that supplies the first, and probably the best, hints for acquiring orderly knowledge of others.","Self-love, it is obvious, remains always positive and active in our natures.","A prejudice, unlike a simple misconception, is actively resistant to all evidence that would unseat it.","Personality is less a finished product than a transitive process. While it has some stable features, it is at the same time continually undergoing change.","To a considerable degree, all minority groups suffer from the same state of marginality with its haunting consequences of insecurity, conflict, and irritation.","The surest way to lose truth is to pretend that one already wholly possesses it.","No corner of the world is free from group scorn.","It takes a major unhappiness, a prolonged and bitter experience, to drive us away from loyalties once formed. And sometimes no amount of punishment can make us repudiate our loyalty.","Scarcely anyone ever wants to be anybody else. However handicapped or unhappy he feels himself, he would not change places with other more fortunate mortals.","So many tangles in life are ultimately hopeless that we have no appropriate sword other than laughter.","It is not that we have class prejudice, but only that we find comfort and ease in our own class. And normally there are plenty of people of our own class, or race, or religion to play, live, and eat with, and to marry.","Open-mindedness is considered to be a virtue. But, strictly speaking, it cannot occur. A new experience must be redacted into old categories. We cannot handle each event freshly in its own right. If we did so, of what use would past experience be?","As partisans of our own way of life, we cannot help thinking in a partisan manner.","What is familiar tends to become a value.","Dogmatism makes for scientific anemia.","Each person is an idiom unto himself, an apparent violation of the syntax of the species.","Mature striving is linked to long-range goals. Thus, the process of becoming is largely a matter of organizing transitory impulses into a pattern of striving and interest in which the element of self-awareness plays a large part.","The primary problem in the psychology of becoming is to account for the transformation by which the unsocialized infant becomes an adult with structured loves, hates, loyalties, and interests, capable of taking his place in a complexly ordered society."],"Gordon Waller":["It was a great time to be making music because everything else was changing.","Elvis Presley, The Everly Brothers, and a lot of American artists were my greatest influences.","A good idea for lyrics and a melody to expand on.","I didn't want to be anyone else."],"Gore Verbinski":["My respect for animation has gone way up. It's a truckload of work. I have to sit with my animators the same way I'd sit with my actors and cast them.","Animation is a technique, not a genre.","I just watched so many Westerns as a kid that you end up using archetypes and sort of tropes of that genre, because there's a language there and you can twist it and turn it on its head or play to it or go sideways at any time.","I just think it's growth when you pursue something you're not sure you can do.","Drama is drama, and it's really... if it's something small, you put a magnifying glass up to it; if it's something big, you use a wide lens.","I think audiences ultimately want something new. I think the business model for a franchise is such that it's very low risk because you have data and studios love data.","Honestly, every person, every individual has a process, and my philosophy, whether it's an actor or an animator, is you try to understand the process that person has so you can get the most out of them, but I think you have to sort of manipulate that process with honesty.","I think you can never ever lie, ever. If you don't know, say, 'I don't know'.","My respect for animators and animation directors has gone way, way up and it is just not something you can phone in.","I think when you get people who are really talented and you take them out of their comfort zone, you get a lot more out of them.","Reading in a sound booth seems very strange. Everyone has a process they are comfortable with; this was uncomfortable for me.","Raising kids these days is hard. I'm the second to last child in my family. I think it's tough; I have two kids, I see them and I feel like I see things in them; they awaken the inner child in you.","I think my parents gave me a love of learning; from there you set out on your own path.","I'm a fan of the western genre. When I see a character actor, I see a whole movie behind a scene before and after. There's a whole other movie behind it.","Everyone always wants to find the answer, to feel that things are resolved. But in dreams, maybe there isn't an answer so much.","I like horror movies, and in fact I like them even more now after making one. I just think they're much more liberating because you don't really have to apply a very strict logic.","I try to push and find something awkward. The gems to me are truly awkward situations, and you have to have somebody who's willing to fail because those can't be conceived. They never play if they're thought about and discussed too much. You have to create them right at the moment and look for something honest.","This is the story, this is your character, I have the sense of the landscape, I have the sense of the scene, I have all that stuff. But I'm also looking for something else to happen, an accident or something. You're focused on the story you intend to tell and then you have to have a peripheral net out to catch these accidents.","Animated films are so precisely engineered - right down to forming lines of dialogue with words pulled from several different takes - how do you translate that spontaneity from the live-action to the digital realm?","I think comedy is drama, often. It's hard to have comedy over a period of time - commercials are one thing, but over a period of time - comedy and tragedy go hand in hand.","When I speak of drama, I'm really referring to just 'desperately trying not to be ordinary'. Trying to get something that has a little bit of friction, conflict, absurdity.","There is a sense that animated movies are suddenly a genre. I just don't believe they are; it's a technique to tell a story.","I'd love to do a PG-13 animated adventure. It would be great.","I always wanted to do an animated movie. I find it to be incredibly liberating as a way of telling a story.","If you imagine yourself as a craftsman at ILM, you spend your days tumbling buses and animating shards of glass. You're doing a lot of visual effects work.","Nothing's occurring in animation - you manufacture everything.","I think people imagine going back to a time when they knew who they were and they knew what the circumstances were - if you screwed up it was your fault.","It's a mistake for Hollywood to impose themselves on the gaming space. Not only is it arrogant, but it hasn't really worked.","My respect for artists is very high. I think to get the most out of them, you have to liberate them. I think part of liberating them is saying, 'Come up with something brilliant, new, and fresh. Stop thinking based on what has been beat into you by executives or publishers in terms of what's going to work and what's not. Don't react, just act.'","All the traditional westerns are about choice and the individual. When progress comes it's much more difficult to define the individual in that world.","My respect for Westerns have gone way, way up. It's hard and treacherous work. It's hard to find people these days who can ride horses like that and jump onto trains.","On a live-action movie, things happen that are unexpected. In animation, you have to fabricate the feeling. That takes a tremendous amount of nuance until the film becomes sentient and gives back.","For me, some of the happiest moments on a live-action film are the awkward moments. One actor says something to another actor. They didn't expect that performance from that actor; that affects their return performance.","I just don't know when we all decided that if it doesn't fit in a Happy Meal box, it's not for kids. I remember flying monkeys in the Wizard of Oz, and I grew up watching Monty Python. I think that kids can handle a lot more than we give them credit for, especially when it comes to the absurd.","Today we're just growing and consuming, and I think maybe there's a sadness in that. People are longing for a time when there was a black and white and good and bad."],"Gore Vidal":["Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn.","At any given moment, public opinion is a chaos of superstition, misinformation and prejudice.","A racial or religious or tribal identity is a kind of fact.","Write something, even if it's just a suicide note.","The four most beautiful words in our common language: I told you so.","By 1939, the Depression was back. Unemployment was huge. Roosevelt didn't have any quick fix. Remember, the New Deal, Works Progress Administration, and Civilian Conservation Corps - all that happened years before. Roosevelt was riding a storm.","Think of the earth as a living organism that is being attacked by billions of bacteria whose numbers double every forty years. Either the host dies, or the virus dies, or both die.","Because there is no cosmic point to the life that each of us perceives on this distant bit of dust at the galaxy's edge... there is all the more reason for us to maintain in proper balance what we have here. Because there is nothing else. No thing. This is it. And quite enough, all in all.","The genius of our ruling class is that it has kept a majority of the people from ever questioning the inequity of a system where most people drudge along, paying heavy taxes for which they get nothing in return.","Anybody who is stupid enough to want to be remembered deserves to be forgotten right now.","You cannot deprive somebody of life, liberty, pursuit of happiness, because that is a right - constitutional right.","World War II made prosperous the United States, which had been undergoing a depression for a dozen years, and made very rich those magnates and their managers who govern the republic - with many a wink - in the people's name.","Overcrowding in the cities is producing a collective madness in which irrational violence flourishes because man needs more space in which to be than the modern city allows.","There is no such thing as a homosexual or a heterosexual person. There are only homo- or heterosexual acts. Most people are a mixture of impulses if not practices.","Never have children, only grandchildren.","In August 1961, I visited President Kennedy at Hyannis Port. The Berlin Wall was going up, and he was about to begin a huge military buildup - reluctantly, or so he said, as he puffed on a cigar liberated by a friend from Castro's Cuba.","Having no contemporaries left means you cannot say, 'Well, so-and-so will like this,' which you do when you're younger. You realize there is no so-and-so anymore. You are your own so-and-so. There is a bleak side to it.","The American high school graduate is two years behind his English, French or German counterpart; in Alabama, God knows how far behind.","I am only at home in the present.","As societies grow decadent, the language grows decadent, too. Words are used to disguise, not to illuminate, action: you liberate a city by destroying it. Words are to confuse, so that at election time people will solemnly vote against their own interests.","After the French Revolution, the world money power shifted from Paris to London. For three generations, the British maintained an old-fashioned colonial empire, as well as a modern empire based on London's primacy in the money markets.","We must declare ourselves, become known; allow the world to discover this subterranean life of ours which connects kings and farm boys, artists and clerks. Let them see that the important thing is not the object of love, but the emotion itself.","We are the United States of Amnesia, which is encouraged by a media that has no desire to tell us the truth about anything, serving their corporate masters who have other plans to dominate us.","I'm not a conspiracy theorist - I'm a conspiracy analyst.","Half of the American people have never read a newspaper. Half never voted for President. One hopes it is the same half.","As for civil liberties, any one who is not vigilant may one day find himself living, if not in a police state, at least in a police city.","History is nothing but gossip about the past, with the hope that it might be true.","Our form of democracy is bribery, on the highest scale.","Any American who is prepared to run for president should automatically, by definition, be disqualified from ever doing so.","The unfed mind devours itself.","I didn't mean to spend my life writing American history, which should have been taught in the schools, but I saw no alternative but to taking it on myself. I could think of a lot of cheerier things I'd rather be doing than analyzing George Washington and Aaron Burr. But it came to pass, that was my job, so I did it.","Today's public figures can no longer write their own speeches or books, and there is some evidence that they can't read them either.","The corporate grip on opinion in the United States is one of the wonders of the Western world. No First World country has ever managed to eliminate so entirely from its media all objectivity - much less dissent.","I'm a fervent foe of water pollution, whether it is our own Hudson River or Philadelphia's tap water.","There is only one party in the United States: the Property party... and it has two right wings: Republican and Democrat.","I'm exactly as I appear. There is no warm, lovable person inside. Beneath my cold exterior, once you break the ice, you find cold water.","In the writing of novels, there is the problem of how to shape a narrative.","The United States was founded by the brightest people in the country - and we haven't seen them since.","In America, the race goes to the loud, the solemn, the hustler. If you think you're a great writer, you must say that you are.","On September 5, 1774, forty-five of the weightiest colonial men formed the First Continental Congress at Philadelphia.","It's odd to meet a rather elderly man who says, 'I've been reading you all my life.' It makes you feel a slight chill.","It is essential to naturalist doctrine that literature, to be good, must, finally, be the author's experience worked out literally.","Temperamentally, I am suspicious of belonging to anything. When I ran for office, I debated seriously whether or not to run as an independent because I was not eager to be saddled with the Democratic Party, because any party label is committing.","It is a paradox of the acquisitive society in which we now live that although private morals are regulated by law, the entrepreneur is allowed considerable freedom to use - and abuse - the public in order to make money.","The first grown-up book that I read on my own was a nineteenth-century edition of 'Tales from Livy' that I'd found in my grandfather's library.","From April 1775 to July 1776, the undeclared war between England and its American colonies smoldered, flared up, appeared to sputter out...

To be perfect for television is all a President has to be these days.","Writing fiction has become a priestly business in countries that have lost their faith.","Envy is the central fact of American life.","I am told the Cheney-Bush team dislikes their junta being compared to the Nazis. If they ceased behaving like Nazis, no comparison would come to mind.","I can't name three first-rate literary critics in the United States. I'm told there are a few hidden away at universities, but they don't print them in 'The New York Times.'","As a schoolboy, I read most of Carl Sandburg's six-volume biography of Abraham Lincoln.","What the Kinseyites and I had in common so long ago was the knowledge that homosexual and heterosexual behavior are natural to all mammals, and that what differs from individual to individual is the balance between these two complementary but not necessarily conflicted drives.","To prevent the theft of 'Ben-Hur's sets, guards were prowling the back lot long after production had been shut down.","Jack Kennedy very much enjoyed Fletcher Knebel's thriller 'Seven Days in May,' later a film.

Truths of reasoning are necessary and their opposite is impossible; those of fact are contingent and their opposite is possible.","When a truth is necessary, the reason for it can be found by analysis, that is, by resolving it into simpler ideas and truths until the primary ones are reached.","Whence it follows that God is absolutely perfect, since perfection is nothing but magnitude of positive reality, in the strict sense, setting aside the limits or bounds in things which are limited.","It can have its effect only through the intervention of God, inasmuch as in the ideas of God a monad rightly demands that God, in regulating the rest from the beginning of things, should have regard to itself.","The ultimate reason of things must lie in a necessary substance, in which the differentiation of the changes only exists eminently as in their source; and this is what we call God.","Music is the pleasure the human mind experiences from counting without being aware that it is counting.","I do not conceive of any reality at all as without genuine unity.","I hold that the mark of a genuine idea is that its possibility can be proved, either a priori by conceiving its cause or reason, or a posteriori when experience teaches us that it is in fact in nature.","Finally there are simple ideas of which no definition can be given; there are also axioms or postulates, or in a word primary principles, which cannot be proved and have no need of proof.","I also take it as granted that every created thing, and consequently the created monad also, is subject to change, and indeed that this change is continual in each one.","Now where there are no parts, there neither extension, nor shape, nor divisibility is possible. And these monads are the true atoms of nature and, in a word, the elements of things.","It follows from what we have just said, that the natural changes of monads come from an internal principle, since an external cause would be unable to influence their inner being.","This is why the ultimate reason of things must lie in a necessary substance, in which the differentiation of the changes only exists eminently as in their source; and this is what we call God.","But in simple substances the influence of one monad over another is ideal only.","For since it is impossible for a created monad to have a physical influence on the inner nature of another, this is the only way in which one can be dependent on another.","I maintain also that substances, whether material or immaterial, cannot be conceived in their bare essence without any activity, activity being of the essence of substance in general.","Indeed every monad must be different from every other. For there are never in nature two beings, which are precisely alike, and in which it is not possible to find some difference which is internal, or based on some intrinsic quality.","Men act like brutes in so far as the sequences of their perceptions arise through the principle of memory only, like those empirical physicians who have mere practice without theory."],"Gotthold Ephraim Lessing":["For me the greatest beauty always lies in the greatest clarity.","They make glorious shipwreck who are lost in seeking worlds.","A single grateful thought toward heaven is the most perfect prayer.","A heretic is a man who sees with his own eyes.","Let us be lazy in everything, except in loving and drinking, except in being lazy.","The most deadly fruit is borne by the hatred which one grafts on an extinguished friendship.","Would that we could at once paint with the eyes! In the long way from the eye through the arm to the pencil, how much is lost!","Think wrongly, if you please, but in all cases think for yourself.","Absolute truth belongs to Thee alone.","It is not the truth that a man possesses, or believes that he possesses, but the earnest effort which he puts forward to reach the truth, which constitutes the worth of a man.","For the will and not the gift makes the giver.","He who doesn't lose his wits over certain things has no wits to lose.","If some things don't make you lose your sense of reason, then you have none to lose.","Let the devil catch you but by a single hair, and you are his forever.","One can drink too much, but one never drinks enough."],"Gotye":["A big part of making music is the discovery aspect, is the surprise aspect. That's why I think I'll always love sampling. Because it involves combining the music fandom: collecting, searching, discovering music history, and artifacts of recording that you may not have known existed and you just kind of unlock parts of your brain, you know?","I guess Surrealism has a draw for me because it's an unknown world. It's a world of subconscious. Some things you can't really get your hands on very easily. Things that are kind of nebulous and they feel like they're not completely formed. You have to feel your way through that.","I quite clearly remember driving home at 9 a.m., after shooting all day, in a bathrobe, with bodypaint all over my face, and going through McDonald's drive-thru. I ordered a coffee to make sure I didn't crash on the way home. And the girl working there, she didn't even bat an eyelid. I guess it's a regular thing down in Hastings McDonald's.","All the records I've put out have had either artwork that I did while I was young or something that my Dad painted.","Through the music I hope to give it an arc that gives it a greater sense of a journey through the set rather than a bunch of songs.","I do get a bit of a sense, just from e-mails some people send me, just a little sense of how people in different countries seem to respond differently to certain lines in a song.","'Somebody That I Used to Know,' like a lot of the record, was a bit of a struggle to finish. It was written fairly quickly - I wrote it in November 2010 - but it took six months to find Kimbra and really realize she was the right vocalist to make the female part come to life. There were constant hurdles.","Sometimes I'll have sections that I'm not quite sure how they fit in the puzzle of a tune, they'll get moved around; what I think was originally a verse ends up becoming the chorus, or what's an intro gets dropped as a hook, things get shifted around a lot.","This 'Making Mirrors' album is far more personal, even if there's a character element to the sounds I'm working with. Every song on this album I stand behind; I feel like I have a close relationship with them. There are older songs where I can feel myself writing a story, so this is the first album where I'm proud of every lyric.'","I tend to just do whatever I want on an album and try to make it work. I'm just adventurous. It's most exciting to be at the edge of your abilities. I want to see how far I can push things.","I have this desire to just while away weeks, months and years. It took me two years to make this record but that was with me trying to condense my process and not disappear down the rabbit hole with all the cool things I've collected. I could take 10 years and not explore everything I want to with these instruments."],"Gough Whitlam":["The punters know that the horse named Morality rarely gets past the post, whereas the nag named Self-interest always runs a good race.","An education system where student selection is based on credit capacity and not merit capacity and where graduating students are no longer indebted to the nation, but increasingly indebted to the Australian Taxation Office - that's no way to improve the quality of education.","I have more influence now than when I had the power.","I'm the only P.M. of which that can be said - 'His legislation was never declared invalid in the High Court.'","Men and women of western Sydney, it's appropriate, you apparently believe, that Australia's oldest surviving Prime Minister should make the concluding remarks in Australia's oldest surviving Government House. I hope the building's foundations are a bit more substantial than mine.","Dying will happen sometime. As you know, I plan for the ages, not just for this life.","The Caucus I joined in 1953 had as many Boer War veterans as men who had seen active service in World War II, three from each. The Ministry appointed on 5 December 1972 was composed entirely of ex-servicemen: Lance Barnard and me.","A conservative government survives essentially by dampening expectations and subduing hopes. Conservatism is basically pessimistic; reformism is basically optimistic."],"Gouverneur Morris":["Religion is the solid basis of good morals; therefore education should teach the precepts of religion, and the duties of man toward God.","This magistrate is not the king. The people are the king.","Americans need never fear their government because of the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation.","If the people should elect, they will never fail to prefer some man of distinguished character, or services; some man, if he might so speak of continental reputation."],"Grace Abbott":["Child labor and poverty are inevitably bound together and if you continue to use the labor of children as the treatment for the social disease of poverty, you will have both poverty and child labor to the end of time.","Sometimes when I get home at night in Washington I feel as though I had been in a great traffic jam.","I stand on the sidewalk watching it because the responsibility is mine and I must, I take a very firm hold on the handles of the baby carriage and I wheel it into the traffic.","The first and continuing argument for the curtailment of working hours and the raising of the minimum age was that education was necessary in a democracy and working children could not attend school.","The jam is moving toward the Capitol where Congress sits in judgment on all the administrative agencies of Government."],"Grace Baruch":["The more a woman likes her job, the better her self-image and the more she enjoys her life.","The things women find rewarding about work are, by and large, the same things that men find rewarding and include both the inherent nature of the work and the social relationships."],"Grace Darling":["Inflated descriptions by the pen or exaggerated illustrations by the pencil.","The cries of the sufferers on the remaining part of the wreck were heard during the night.","I have seven apartments in the house to keep in a state fit to be inspected everyday by Gentlemen."],"Grace Gealey":["We may not know what each day has in store for us. We could be gone tomorrow. Any minute could truly be our goodbye. But we do have this moment. This time. Today. Right now. It takes way more effort to shell out hate then it does to allow love to flow freely in our lives. After all, it's what we were born to do.","Disrespect is tired. Shade is old. Sipping 'tea' isn't cute. But loving, supporting, giving, being grateful and perpetuating light, is.","Lift others and yourself as you rise above this mess of comparison. Thank God for those who embraced their true selves and gave us gifts that only they could give: from Steve Jobs to Michael Jackson to Ray Charles to Mark Twain. There are so many more, and the list goes on.","Everybody has a different journey. Everybody has a different path, and you don't really know what to expect. All you know is to just keep plugging away, and you hope something will come through and something will happen.","I used to have really long hair. It was a big fro with mad curls.","I'm a night owl.","I'm really easy to please and not high-maintenance at all. I like that chill, not stressed-out kind of lifestyle.","It's so easy to get whisked away in the hubbub of friends, work and busy-ness, but we need to take the time to be still and become aware of ourselves. The small things. The fact that we're still breathing. Our ability to move. The presence of love around and in us. Our strengths. Our opportunities. Our journeys.","Let us swell with gratitude and allow it to overwhelm us. It isn't as cliche as we make it; life truly is short. Let's spend it all lavishly wallowing in gratitude.","I don't have time to beat myself up over my fallible nature. Instead I use my energy to learn from my past and let it inform my future. It's time to own all of our glory, mistakes, mess and light and be gentle to ourselves. Let's be kind to our spirits and celebrate the truth of our hearts.","We need you. The best version of you. You're here for a reason, and we can't wait to see what that is. Stay in your lane. Run that race.","When I look around at this world, we women need each other so badly, it breaks my heart. Sisterhood is dissipating, and we aren't doing nearly enough to salvage it. Eliminate the crazies in your life, yes. But also look again at those around you.","I find that when I put too much makeup on, or I use a certain brand, my skin will break out. I tend to gravitate towards water-based foundations because my skin absorbs them a little better and it doesn't break out as much. I use Hourglass Mineral Veil. It's so amazing.","The best work we can ever do in this world is work on being the greatest version of ourselves so we can continue to give the highest version of this to others.","Even though there will be times when I'll need to protect myself - there will definitely be times when I'll have to put up my guard just to monitor what comes in and out of my life - there's a grace there... no pun intended!","Honestly, I'm very much a tomboy.","I was raised by a single black deaf woman, so I am as independent as they come.","I'm a very spiritual person, and I believe in God and all that kind of stuff. So my perfect type of guy would be spiritually grounded, extremely respectful and funny because I love to laugh.","There were times when I was working three jobs at one time, and I was still auditioning just to make ends meet, and I was hoping that something was going to come through. Especially after you have two degrees, standing solid through the process is sometimes the hardest part because there is no guarantee.","I would love to share the screen with Meryl Streep, wouldn't we all? I would love to work with Spielberg and Scorsese; that would be lovely. I'm also a huge fan of Johnny Depp and the way he creates his characters, so that would be fun. I mean, any of the greats, really.","My mother is Afro-Caribbean and my father is Caucasian-American, and I was born in Pennsylvania and moved to the Cayman Islands when I was about 2. So I grew up there with my mother, and it's really all I know. I grew up there until it was time to go to college, and that's when I moved back to America.","I used to run around barefoot and climb trees and pick fruit and sell it on the side of the road like a real island girl.","Because of the fact that being a professional actor is not a career that is widely pursued back home in the Cayman Islands, I never thought it was a viable profession. It didn't even cross my mind. So when I knew I wanted to do theater, I didn't think 'actress,' even though I loved to perform.","There a lot of other things I love to do. I consider myself as an artist, so I dance, I paint, I sing, so as long as I'm creating, I'm happy.","Back home, we watch a lot of movies, and that was never available to us. When I came to America, I was like, 'No, it's really coming out this Friday? Not three months from now?'","There's something scary, knowing that in Florida, someone can pick you up in a car and drive you to 50 states. Back home, it's like, 'Girl, you're 15 minutes away.'","I understand that there are a few roles out there and tons of actors. Just because you don't get the big break doesn't mean you're not worthy or that what you have to offer isn't valid.","Living the life I have lived - being raised by deaf parents, assimilating to a different culture, and the challenges I have faced over time - has given me insight to the fact that each person has their own complex, intricate story, and it's rarely what I suspect it is. We must have compassion and grace for each other. We must.","As a kid, I was obsessed with Meryl Streep, and I still am.","Bruno Mars, I'm kind of obsessed with him.","Do you, and the rest is background noise.","When I came to America, that's when I started to feel that there was a lot of push-back from women. I was definitely made aware that I am light-skinned. I realized that was a thing here.","There's competition among women everywhere you go. But back home, we understand that you can look like a variety of things and still be from the same culture. What I'm saying is that I've never felt like I was a light-skinned black woman. Never felt that way because we shared the same culture back home.","There's a love that I want to continue to offer people. And, I hope I can offer people that love through the art.","Instead of wanting to be better than other people, let's channel that energy to be better than we were yesterday and then again to be the best we can be tomorrow.","I do miss my hair because I used to do so much stuff with it, but I do like different levels of short. I had a super short pixie before, and I loved it.","I am very disciplined with my skin - I tone and I moisturize my skin twice a day. I also exfoliate, and I try to get a facial, like, once every two months.","I honestly believe in a force that's larger than our own.","'Empire' deals with the black experience, the human experience, sibling rivalry, what it feels like to be ignored or doted upon by a parent, illness, death. There are so many things that I think the audience can identify with.","In society, we have to earn other things of import like trust, respect, money, education, careers, status and etc., so naturally, we find ourselves attempting to earn love, acceptance and validation along with that. Here's the trip: we do it at the cost of other people and, more importantly, ourselves.","The greatest lesson I have learned in life is that I am enough simply because I have been given life. Growing up, I constantly found myself trying to please others because I wanted to be included and validated. I expended myself completely.","Once I started to get aligned with the God in me, something hit me hard: I learned that our worth, our validation, our purpose and our acceptance don't stem from what we should do. They don't stem from what we have. They don't stem from what we've done or who we were. They stem simply from the fact that we are.","Are we truly being our sisters' keepers? Initially, that dog-eat-dog mentality within us may bark and say that we aren't responsible for other people, but if that was truly the case, then why are we even here? We have so much to offer and give to this world.","As a child, I was always interested in drama and performance.","Having racially diverse casts on television is a more accurate depiction of the demographic of the world we live in.","Connecting with people in person is so important. To look in the eyes of our girls and let them know that you really do support them transcends the impersonal connection of technology.","The Saving Our Cinderellas program is a facet of Saving Our Daughters which is more specifically geared towards using music, theatre, film and television as a means to help build self-esteem in our girls by developing programs that allow them to discover, explore and express their individuality using the arts."],"Grace Gummer":["I'm just lucky to have great parents. My sister's an actress. My brother's a musician. I found it hard growing up in such a... creatively driven family. I wanted to have this thing to create, myself.","I played lacrosse for a hot second, but I was mainly a swimmer - captain of my swim team.","My dad's great. He's an amazing artist. A sculptor. He's wonderful and supportive. I love going to museums with him - we talk about... everything.","I wanted to be an Olympic swimmer when I was growing up.","The arts have always been in and around my life.","I spent my summers in Connecticut scooping ice cream and babysitting.","I'm 23, so I'm not done with my life. But acting, definitely, out of what I've done so far, makes me feel the most alive and is very invigorating and thrilling. So I figured I might as well try it for a while.","There's something magical about theater. You can live the character every single day to the point where you become that person.","I love shawls!","I'm never not nervous before going onstage. Like... what if I fall on my face?","I've been told that I'm good at impersonating people."],"Grace Helbig":["I think if you ask people why they watch me, there would be some common thread among all of them that I'm somewhat of an awkward older sister. I have a teen, mostly female demographic. How that happened, I don't know. But I think they see me as some sort of bizarre role model, and I'll keep trying to do that for them.","A lot of YouTubers, because they have such pride in what they do, have a negative connotation towards television. I don't feel that way. I feel like it's another medium to reach a broader audience.","Be the weirdest little weird in all Weird Town.","When I started 'DailyGrace,' I was dating a 26-year-old guy I thought was the funniest person in the world. My creation process every day was imagining him watching my videos and wondering, 'Will he laugh at this?' But somehow that's turned into an audience that's mostly 15-year-old girls.","I hate auditioning; it makes me more nervous than anything ever, and I always feel like I wasted my time and I could have been creating my own thing. With the Internet, you have so much freedom that 'gatekeepers' make me terrified.","I imagine 'Daily Grace' as, like, your awkward older sister who tries to give you advice.","I have terrible taste in things: music, movies, TV shows. I love all the guilty pleasures: Bravo, 'Real Housewives.'","I did six internships, even though I was only allowed to do one. I had a paper with my advisor's signature on it that I would just forward for every new internship. I didn't get school credit, but I got away with giving free labor to everyone.","It's insanely difficult to ask an audience to go somewhere other than YouTube to watch videos.","I want to make videos that, if I didn't know myself, I'd want to watch. As long as I'm making myself laugh, I'm usually having a good time. That's how I know I've made a video that I'm proud of: I've made myself laugh.","I hope what's different for not only the channel 'It's Grace' 2014, but for the brand overall, is I hope to continue to expand into other areas of creative content and original content. We have 'Camp Takota' coming out on Valentine's Day - we're all so pumped for it! It's so exciting!","After doing a total of five years of 'Daily Grace,' you kind of get burned out on doing the same thing over and over again, so I am allowing myself to not have totally any specific structure.","The Internet is a very intimate entertainment experience. I'm in my own apartment talking to people, and I want them to feel like they're with me in my apartment. So if I'm listening to them and taking ideas from them and being honest with how I'm feeling, it resonates even more that we're having a real, actual conversation.","When I've done somewhat scripted stuff, it feels a little flat. It feels like there's not much life behind it.","Winning 'Best Vlogger of 2013' from MTV is a really wonderful honor, and I wanted to thank all of you out there that used your fingers and clicked a button and made this happen, and to all of you that accidentally clicked my name and you were trying to click Jack and Finn, I'm sorry.","TV has been my goal since before I started YouTube."],"Grace Hightower":["Everyone has something to contribute to this world. It's just a matter of being given that opportunity to do so.","I don't encourage kids to eat sugar, but I do it.","I did everything. I worked at S.S. Kresge, the five-and-dime. I worked in a mailroom. I worked processing insurance claims.","I grew up in Kilmichael, Mississippi. It's a dot on the map 100 miles north of Jackson.","I'm not the type of person that could take someone else's funds and take a chance with them.","If I go anywhere, and I don't have my coffee, I don't drink coffee. When I travel, I carry it with me - and I ask hotels to grind it and brew it for me if I can't have it in my room myself. I'm dedicated that way.","I'll give you my routine, my morning ritual: I get up, I do a bit of stretching, and then after showering and everything, I have a half cup of warm lemon water. I've been doing that forever. I love it. It just brightens everything for me.","Before I started Coffee of Grace, I assumed all coffee came from Latin America or Indonesia. I wasn't familiar with African coffee.","My vision is to hire qualified employees that may have not yet had the opportunity to create a better life for themselves, or did have one but might have came down on hard times and need a hand."],"Grace Hopper":["A ship in port is safe, but that's not what ships are built for.","It is often easier to ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission.","If it's a good idea, go ahead and do it. It's much easier to apologize than it is to get permission.","I handed my passport to the immigration officer, and he looked at it and looked at me and said, 'What are you?'","No computer is ever going to ask a new, reasonable question. It takes trained people to do that."],"Grace Jones":["Hiding, secrets, and not being able to be yourself is one of the worst things ever for a person. It gives you low self-esteem. You never get to reach that peak in your life. You should always be able to be yourself and be proud of yourself.","I just go with the flow, I follow the yellow brick road. I don't know where it's going to lead me, but I follow it.","I don't like people who hide things. We're not perfect, we all have things that people might not like to see, and I like to show my faults.","When I was modelling, I spent half my life staring at thousands of perfect reflections. It got to a stage where I was losing all sense of reality - so after I quit modelling, I took all the mirrors out of my house.","I only move forwards, never backwards, darling.","We're not perfect; we all have things that people might not like to see, and I like to show my faults.","I see myself as no color. I can play the role of a man. I can paint my face white if I want to and play the role of white. I can play a green, I can be a purple. I think I have that kind of frame and that kind of attitude where I can play an animal.","I believe in individuality, that everybody is special, and it's up to them to find that quality and let it live.","I'm always rebelling. I don't think I'll ever stop.","I like dressing like a guy. I love it. When I was modeling I used to do pictures where I would dress up like my little brother. No makeup, and I looked like a boy.","One creates oneself.","My husband used to shout at my mother, 'What is wrong with your daughter? I'm married to a man.'","I've changed. I'm not worried about what people think, because I think people think what they want to think anyway.","Most performers take themselves too seriously. They forget there is a difference between the characters they play on the screen or stage and themselves, but the public doesn't forget there is a difference. They see how silly it is if you try to be the same person all the time.","I never do what anyone else is doing. I could walk away from music and become a farmer or do some crochet. The worst thing in life for me is to do something I'm not happy doing.","I don't like people who hide things.","I'm not a rock star; I'm a soft person.","I feel feminine when I feel feminine. I feel masculine when I feel masculine. I am a role switcher.","I am not a diva: I am a Jones. 'Diva' is so overused. Diva, icons, the whole thing, legends... To be a diva, what is that?","I like conflicts. I love competition. I like discovering things for myself. It's a childlike characteristic, actually. But that gives you a certain amount of power, and people are intimidated by that.","Gaga came to me, and I just could not find a soul. I come from church; maybe that has something to do with it. I like to get to the soul of a person. I just didn't feel a soul.","I go feminine, I go masculine. I am both, actually. I think the male side is a bit stronger in me, and I have to tone it down sometimes. I'm not like a normal woman, that's for sure.","If people think I'm angry, I don't want to burst anybody's bubble. I like sometimes for people to be afraid of me. But it's not really anger; it's discipline.","Everyone has to make their own decisions. I still believe in that. You just have to be able to accept the consequences without complaining.","My dad's family were political and he was always a theatrical creature, whereas my mum is really musical and her father was the touring pianist with Nat King Cole. My family was an explosive mixture of politics, religion and music - no wonder I turned out how I did.","Growing up in Jamaica, the Pentecostal church wasn't that fiery thing you might think. It was very British, very proper. Hymns. No dancing. Very quiet. Very fundamental.","My mum was very glamorous, an incredible seamstress. She made up those Vogue, Givenchy and Yves St. Laurent patterns they used to sell. It was church couture, darling! Because my dad was a pastor, she could get away with more than other women. Her skirts were that bit tighter.","Shock always sells. You know? But you could shock in good taste.","You had to wear a hat to go to church. We weren't allowed to straighten our hair. We couldn't wear jewellery, nail polish, open backed shoes, skirts above the knee... trousers were forbidden because male apparel on a female was not godly.","Be like Sasha Fierce. Be like Miley Cyrus. Be like Rihanna. Be like Lady Gaga. Be like Rita Ora and Sia. Be like Madonna. I cannot be like them, except to the extent that they are already being like me.","There is some Eighties music that is just timeless. The melodies, the lyrics... I called it church. Church in club. You can shout and dance. The best of the Eighties was club church.","I always had to mask my emotions. I could never show that I missed my mom or my dad, especially when they moved to America. My grandparents were tough. I was not allowed to receive letters that had not been read before. Everything was controlled - everything!","I was born into a very religious family where everything was about setting the right example for the community and having to obey orders blindly. I felt that everyone was growing up in the world, except me. This is probably one of the reasons why I had such a rebellious attitude towards any form of authority.","For me, a diva is like the great opera singer, the great film star - out of reach, in their own world, with a real gift for invention: attention-demanding performance artists with a flamboyant, compelling sense of their own importance so special and inimitable it verges on the alien.","I like to think of myself as a positive person. Otherwise I wouldn't have had a child.","I came from a very strict background, and didn't hear any Jamaican music when I was growing up.","When I started modelling, I'd raise my arms and it was all muscle and all the other models had nothing. Really, everybody thought I was a man. I don't have to do much to have muscles. It's just genetic.","It was very painful combing my hair. My grand-uncle was a Pentecostal bishop, and he was very strict: our hair couldn't be permed or straightened. So I just cut it all off.","I wanted to be a 'jungle mom', where you're giving birth and getting up and doing things straightaway.","They used to call me Firefly when I was a little girl, and I always tried to figure out why I was being called a firefly. I was really black, black, black from the sun. After being in Jamaica for 13 years, my eyes were really beady and white, and my skin was really black. I must have really looked like a fly. My eyes looked like lights, like stars.","My brother used to get beaten up all the time because he was very effeminate.","More having to do whatever anybody said you had to do. I couldn't really do anything on my own. But as I got older and then came to America and then Grace became my name, it somehow freed me. All of a sudden, I can be this other person.","Music has its own depths, and I let it take me where it takes me, even if it means stripping all my clothes off.","Human beings should stick together. Honestly, if I see a red-haired person with blue eyes now, I say, 'Is your granny black?'","Now when I enter a carriage, it almost empties. But there's always one brave enough to stay.","Use, don't abuse.","Models are there to look like mannequins, not like real people. Art and illusion are supposed to be fantasy.","I like to isolate myself when I work because I end up losing my voice by doing interviews all day.","My mother was a champion high-jumper. My three brothers are basketball players. We've all been very athletic.","I would have rebelled against parental authority, no matter what. When I was 15, I started painting my face and making my own clothes.","Women and men grow up with both sexes. Our mothers and fathers mean a lot to us, so it's just a question of finding a balance between their influences. I've found mine. And it tends to be more on the male side. I mean male side the way we understand it in the West.","I never thought I was going to be a singer. That was an accident.","I don't think 'pop' should mean that you had no talent.","I loved all those classic figures from the '30s and '40s... Bette Davis, Joan Crawford, Humphrey Bogart, Rita Hayworth. They had such glamour and style. I loved the movies of those times too - so much attention paid to details, lights, clothing, the way the studios would develop talent.","When you become such a strong personality in music, it's hard for people to accept you as a different character.","I've turned down millions of dollars to go on reality TV. It's an absolute no-go.","I always thought that feminine, softer side was just too vulnerable to put out there, because then it's like you're opening up a door for everybody to come in, and you don't know who's going to come in that door.","When I perform on stage I become those male bullies, those dominators from my childhood. That's probably why it's so scary, because they scared me.","I love women, but I've never had a relationship with a woman.","I'm not as impatient as I used to be. I used to hit people if I didn't like what they were saying. Just lash out. 'Bam - shut up! Hahahah!' I was terrible.","I've had more misrepresentations than I can handle, and people have told the wickedest lies about me. A lot of them have taken their frustrations out on me, and I don't like that because it can wound. Not necessarily me, but those around me. Journalists can be so bad.","I don't take the English press seriously at all because all they want is dirt... I hate them.","In the Seventies and Eighties we all had our fun, and now and then we went really too far. But, ultimately, it required a certain amount of clear thinking, a lot of hard work and good make-up to be accepted as a freak.","My father would have been made a bishop much earlier than he was had it not been for me and my image.","You can't expect your children to be perfect.","Rock n' roll can get quite overwhelming. You can get caught up in the cycle.","I'm too vain, one of my biggest sins, but it saved me; I can see what excess does.","I don't collaborate. You're born alone, you die alone, you get on stage alone.","I was the only black girl at my junior high school. I had an afro, a Jamaican accent, I looked really old.","To be honest, my life is not really as way-out and myth-loaded as people like to portray it.","I am an actress first, a singer second.","I didn't think I had a voice at all, and I still think of myself as an interpreter of songs more than a singer. I thought it was too deep; people thought I was a man. I had a very strong Jamaican accent, too; the accent really messed me up for auditions.","I was skinny as a rail and had high cheekbones and a very interesting face - or so I was told.","If you want me to work with you, then come with an idea. Come with music.","I have been so copied by those people who have made fortunes that people assume I am that rich. But I did things for the excitement, the dare, the fact that it was new, not for the money. And too many times I was the first, not the beneficiary.","Normally, I stay away from politics - unless I'm going to run for president.","I don't wear jewelry, so I wear furs. I don't have diamonds.","Mum was a high-jumper and qualified to go to the Olympics, but it got into the newspapers that she was married to my father, and the church put pressure on her to pull out of the Olympic team, saying, 'You can't be exposing all your legs.' That's how strong the influence of the church was on us all.","I was a go-go dancer, too. I called myself 'Grace Mendoza' to fool my parents.","Sometimes we'd have to climb a tree and pick our own whips to be disciplined with. When you had to pick your own whip, you knew you were in for it.","I like to experiment, and as an actress, I always thought it's good to be open about a lot of things.","You don't do oysters and red wine together. That's a no-no; you just don't do that. I love a nice white wine with oysters.","There will always be a replacement coming along very soon - a newer version, a crazier version, a louder version. So if you haven't got a long-term plan, then you are merely a passing phase, the latest trend, yesterday's event.","The problem with the Dorises and the Nicki Minajes and Mileys is that they reach their goal very quickly. There is no long-term vision, and they forget that once you get into that whirlpool, then you have to fight the system that solidifies around you in order to keep being the outsider you claim you represent.","This is what I would say to my pupil: 'You have become only your fame and left behind most of who you were. How are you going to deal with that? Will you lose that person forever? Have you become someone else without really knowing it? Do you always have to stay in character for people to like you? Do you know that you are in character?'.","Listen to my advice; I have some experience. In a way, it is me being a teacher, which is what I wanted to be. I still feel I could go into teaching. What is teaching but passing on your knowledge to those who are at the beginning? Some people are born with that gift.","People always like to make me seem taller than I am.","Some people are both genders. I think you just come out the way you come out, and you have to embrace it honestly.","I don't party now, and nobody really knows how to party with me anymore. So I stay in a lot. I really am a home person.","Religion has stayed with me even though I rebelled.","I had no childhood, really, so I imagined more than played, and that definitely led to my showbusiness image, the theatrics and the drama of my life.","I'm a man-eating machine.","It's important that the sexes understand each other.","Fear is fear of fear, I think.","Even though the agency kept me pretty busy, I auditioned for every play and film I could find. But they all wanted a black American sound, and I just didn't have it. Finally, I got tired of trotting around and took myself to Paris.","Yelling between people in love is normal.","It's the nature of man to give and receive - to be man and woman, all in one."],"Grace Kelly":["Getting angry doesn't solve anything.","I don't want to dress up a picture with just my face.","I don't want to be married to someone who feels inferior to my success or because I make more money than he does.","Women's natural role is to be a pillar of the family.","If anybody starts using me as scenery, I'll return to New York.","Other women looked on me as a rival. And it pained me a great deal.","Emancipation of women has made them lose their mystery.","The freedom of the press works in such a way that there is not much freedom from it.","For a woman, forty is torture, the end.","As an unmarried woman, I was thought to be a danger.","I don't like yelling and fighting, and I can't quarrel."],"Grace Lee Boggs":["I don't know what the next American revolution is going to be like, but we might be able to imagine it if your imagination were rich enough.","When I was growing up, Asians were so few and far between as to be almost invisible. And so the idea of an Asian American movement or an Asian American thrust in this country was unthinkable.","When I came to Detroit, if you threw a stone up in the air and it came down, it would hit an autoworker because the Chrysler Jefferson plant where my husband worked was very close also to where we lived.","I warn you, I'm a terrible housekeeper.","I had no idea what I was gonna do after I got my degree in philosophy in 1940. But what I did know was at that time, if you were a Chinese-American, even department stores wouldn't hire you. They'd come right out and say, 'We don't hire Orientals.'","I think that's a very important part of what we need in this country, is that sense that we have lived through so many stages and that we are entering into a new stage where we could create something completely different.","I think Detroit is already providing a model for change in the world. I think that Detroit - I mean, people come from all over the world come to see what we're doing. People are looking for a new way of living.","I was working with C. L. R. James; I believed in Marxist ideas about the labor and movement and the workers being the secret to the future. And I learned differently just by being in Detroit and being married to Jimmy Boggs.","Jimmy Boggs was born in a little town called Marion Junction, Alabama, where there were as many pigs, or more pigs, than even the people. But you know what? People in the South had an understanding that you could make a way out of no way, and that's how they survived."],"Grace Lee Whitney":["I'm in a great place because I've gone full circle.","My life is happy, joyous, free, sober and saved, and a lot of fun, too. I have a lot of fun.","When I told the fans I was an alcoholic, they all applauded. When I told them I had given myself to a higher power, they cheered again."],"Grace Lin":["I've always wanted to write an early reader. When I wrote my first novel, my goal was to make it an early reader, but it grew beyond the category.","When I meet children at book signings, they'll bring me photos of when I first met them many years ago when they were reading my picture books, and now they're telling me how much they enjoy my novels.","The early readers are in-between books for the kids who aren't ready for novels yet but are done with my picture books. It's really rewarding to think that they can grow up reading my books at all the different levels.","When I was younger, I was very princessy. I always wanted to be blond-haired and blue-eyed. This was before Mulan, so I was very upset about all the Cinderellas. I always tried to imagine that maybe Snow White was Chinese since she had black hair."],"Grace Meng":["I take the definition and title of my job - Representative - seriously. That's what I will be above and beyond everything else.","I've loved being in legislative office on a state level, and I think on a federal level there are so many more opportunities. I'm so excited to accomplish more.","That's the one thing I probably don't like about politics - the focus on the individual. To me, it's more important to get it done, whether I get the credit for it or not.","Being the only Asian-American in the State Legislature, I've had no choice but to reach across the aisle.","Queens is so often treated as a stepchild and labeled as an outer borough. At the very least, if I could help bring more attention to what we need, and what the federal government needs to do to improve the quality of life of people right here in Queens - any way that I can do that, I'm very happy to do that.","I'm just going to let my record in Congress speak for itself.","As the daughter of immigrants, growing up in New York City, you are either at the table or on the menu.","There are many Asian-Americans who are living in poverty, especially our senior citizens.","When people see Barack Obama, they don't necessarily see an African-American president. They see someone who is a child of immigrants. They see someone whose family has worked hard and struggled. And they see many similarities between themselves and Barack Obama.","I want to see America thrive. I want to see all different families here succeed.","Queens is famous throughout the world for diversity and tolerance. But really it's what we have in common that makes our neighborhoods work, our students succeed, and our families able to care for children and grandparents as they can.","It's nice to be a woman, and it's nice to be an Asian. But what's more important is what I can bring back to my district.","Oftentimes, the only evidence left behind at the scene of a shooting are bullet shell casings.","I was raised as a Christian, where all you're taught is to be humble, even if you did something right. Politics is the complete opposite of: you do something a little nice, and you tell everyone."],"Grace Metalious":["I looked into that empty bottle and I saw myself.","Even Tom Sawyer had a girlfriend and to talk about adults without talking about their sex drives is like talking about a window without glass.","To talk about adults without talking about their sex drives is like talking about a window without glass."],"Grace Napolitano":["We must take the time to do what needs to be done now, what is right, instead of passing a bad bill.","We must explain the truth: There is no free lunch.","Our political leaders must be honest and forthcoming with data that will allow citizens to use facts and figures to judge for themselves what state Social Security is in.","We must work to stabilize Social Security. We must not gamble with our nation's social insurance program, one of our most popular and effective federal programs that has remained dependable and stable for the past 70 years.","We must level with the people and explain to them that Social Security will first face funding problems in 2042 that can be fixed now with changes that do not undermine and ultimately drain from the entire program.","We are still waiting for the president to introduce a concrete plan. He has just hinted at what he is thinking about doing, but no one has seen a proposal.","To allow all U.S. workers to put part of their earnings into private investment accounts would definitely erode the Social Security system and cause uncertainty for new investors.","There is a need for Social Security reform to ensure its stability, and Congress must act.","The president's claim that Social Security is going broke is misleading at best. The sky is not falling, although there is no doubt that the system needs to be strengthened.","Social Security has been effective for 70 years; prior predictions of its demise have been totally overstated.","President Bush has consistently used rhetoric, and that is not convincing given his past record.","Our Hispanic community needs to understand how important the Social Security system is for not only its retired citizens, but also its disabled workers.","Latinos are disproportionately more likely to be injured on the job than other ethnic groups.","Latinas' life expectancies are relatively long. When a current retiree hits 65 and begins receiving her benefit check, she can expect to live another 22 years. That life expectancy is higher than white women or men.","If Congress doesn't raise taxes, you cannot get a private investment account without forgoing a portion, possibly all, of your guaranteed benefit check.","I am not criticizing investing in the stock market; I am an investor.","For people who have for been putting their hard-earned money into the system for years, the president's idea would replace their safety net with a risky gamble with no assurance of a stable return of investment.","Even without reforms, the Social Security fund will be able to meet 100 percent of its obligations until 2042.","Because Social Security is specifically designed to boost the retirement income of low earners with a progressive benefit formula, the program has played an enormous and necessary role in keeping Latinas out of poverty.","Because of their low earnings and family obligations, Latinas would not be putting much money into private investment accounts. An average Latina could wind up losing thousands of dollars under this proposal.","Because of my own experience with market fluctuation, I recognize the great risks one takes on investments. This converts the Social Security safety net into a risky proposition many cannot afford to take.","Almost half of all Latinas currently on Social Security rely exclusively on their benefit check in retirement.","A Congressional Budget Office report released as recent as June 2004 says the system will be able to pay full benefits until 2052, and 80 percent after that."],"Grace Paley":["Sometimes, walking with a friend, I forget the world.","Let us go forth with fear and courage and rage to save the world.","In the end, long life is the reward, strength, and beauty.","Most of the Women's Libbers I knew really didn't want to have a piece of the men's pie. They thought that pie was kind of poisonous, toxic, really full of weapons, poison gases, all kinds of mean junk we didn't even want a slice of.","Whatever you do, life don't stop. It only sits a minute and dreams a dream.","What I generally tell a class is that if you're not interested in anybody else's work but your own, take another class.","You become a writer because you need to become a writer - nothing else.","In prose, I think you sometimes have to write in very plain language, where every line may not seem to be so important, though in all writing every line is important.","Everyone, real or invented, deserves the open destiny of life.","I was a woman writing at the early moment when small drops of worried resentment and noble rage were secretly, slowly building into the second wave of the women's movement. I didn't know my small-drop presence or usefulness in this accumulation.","If you want to do things, do things.","The word career is a divisive word. It's a word that divides the normal life from business or professional life.","Rosiness is not a worse windowpane than gloomy gray when viewing the world.","All that is really necessary for survival of the fittest, it seems, is an interest in life, good, bad or peculiar.","I often see through things right to the apparition itself.","I don't believe civilization can do a lot more than educate a person's senses.","I believe in a kind of fidelity to your own early ideas; it's a kind of antagonism in me to prevailing fads.","I was a fantastic student until ten, and then my mind began to wander.","A relationship with young people is very important to me. It's important to have a sense of what's going on in their world and not just in my own. So the opportunity teaching provides is a gift.","I see women as oppressed, but I don't see them as victims; I see them rising all the time. I see them as very strong.","Poets take themselves very seriously.","What I'm interested in doing in a story is bringing certain different languages, people, events together and then letting the reader make what he wants of it.","'The Immigrant Story,' which took me about twenty-five years to write, was a very simple story, but I couldn't think of how to tell it. Then twenty years after I started it, I found this one page and realized it was going to be the story. That's the only way you get it sometimes.","I didn't write any fiction until I was past thirty.","Writing poetry, which for me was then saying how I felt about this and that, didn't help me to understand the world I lived in.","I developed a definition - which I think becomes less and less accurate as poetry moves into the world - that poetry was a way of speaking to the world, but fiction was a way to get the world to speak to me.","You have to really understand how people speak, and you have to reconstruct it... Most pleasure in writing, you know, is in inventing.","That's the trouble with stories. People start out fantastic. You think they're extraordinary, but it turns out as the work goes along, they're just average with a good education."],"Grace Park":["I don't know what it is about me that gets cast in specific roles. Some people would say, 'You're just a pretty face,' but on 'Battlestar,' I'm not looking pretty every day. I'm pretty banged up.","I'm not a big gamer, really. I used to play back in the day - 'Mario Brothers,' 'Mario Kart' and 'Mortal Kombat.'","I never wanted fame, of all things, and I'm not just being cheeky. There are benefits that come with being famous, but there's also confusion. It's important to make sure your feet stay on the ground.","I don't feel typecast almost at all, and it could just be because I'm insensitive, but I doubt it. I think most of my roles I've gotten have very little to do with my ethnicity. I don't feel that's a limiting factor for my career.","There's an inordinate amount of attention put on actors. Some people want to make their lives public, but that doesn't mean everybody does.","It is very sad about Michael Jackson, much as in the tragic cases of Heath Ledger, Anna Nicole and other celebrities who have died are a result of drugs. It is always sad when such a bright light goes out.","Acting in 'Command & Conquer 3' called for me to interact with the player and to look directly into the camera, which is a big no no when filming for TV or film.","I'm totally not a blogger. Sometimes I don't even check my email. I know I should.","When I started, I was told that, for all intents and purposes, I was playing a human, which made it easier. Until they told me, 'Grace, you're a Cylon, she wouldn't do that.' And later, I learned that Cylons are actually more human than humans. This has been an ongoing exploration.","When people in Vancouver do recognize me, they hide it. I went to a store near my home and I know they're 'Battlestar' fans - they have pictures on the wall! - and I know they know me, but everyone was so smooth and pretended I wasn't there. Most people don't realize how good they are at acting in everyday life.","I've certainly been very blessed. I can only say that I worked very hard in class and on set doing the best that I can at the moment. I was incredibly blessed with 'Battlestar'... I tried to work my little butt off just to keep up with everybody else and not too many people kicked me."],"Grace Phipps":["Yes, obviously, I would love to play a vampire! I mean, I went to Hot Topic and got the fake vampire teeth for Halloween in middle school. Obviously, I want fangs sometime!","Oh my God. Am I a 'Buffy' fan? 'Buffy' on DVD got me through middle school.","Since 'Buffy,' vampires have become kind of softer and gushier instead of, you know, man-eating monsters.","I like my monsters to be monsters.","I used to eat lunch with the teachers at school. I just remember that kids would put their legs on the seats next to them so that I wouldn't have a place to sit."],"Grace Poe":["It's always best to ask for forgiveness if you feel that you made a mistake. And again, asking for forgiveness is not just saying the words 'I'm sorry'; it is also offering what you need to do.","Your aspiration is really for the country to be better. I think that's exactly what I've gone through - a Filipino who may live elsewhere but who cares just as much for the country.","My dad was such a great story-teller, a good teacher.","Even if we do not walk together on the straight path, as long as we have the same destination, that is what's important.","Like every parent, I cannot rest easy until my children are home safe at night.","If, through death penalty, we can create fears, though it's against my will, we have to do it.","As a public figure, you have to maintain a certain demeanor. We also have responsibility to the public, but of course, I'm not perfect. I have a lot of flaws; my husband can tell you that, my friends, even. They know who I am.","I believe that transparency is the solution to our problem on corruption.","Integrity is a very important and an almost indispensable virtue that all leaders must possess. This is especially true in the Philippine context because we Filipinos really respond to leadership by example.","I'm not for censorship without reason.","I see the Philippines one day as a developed country, one of the major economies of Asia - perhaps not in six years, but definitely in our lifetime.","If you don't expose something to sunlight, microbes and germs will thrive.","What is important is a leader who can be trusted.","You need a president whom you can trust, someone who will not steal your money, a president who is sincere, brave and just.","Nothing will deter crime but the certainty of punishment.","The people who have been helping me in the past continue to support me. Many of them supported my father, and the support isn't just financial.","Whenever I come here to Ilocos, I get sentimental because I always remember that as a child, I would ride a bike with my father in Paoay near where they were shooting 'Panday.'","Definitely, I am not advocating an arms race.","The straight path is not one that is reserved for a few. This should be taken by more of us.","My resume is lean enough that I don't have the added baggage that is not necessary to be able to be successful in government.","The string of disqualification cases were filed against me when I was still contemplating a run for the presidency by people whose motives were suspect at best. Powerful groups with personal agenda are behind these cases. But I am not afraid. Not when the people are behind me.","Underlings look up to the boss for behavioral cues, subtle signs, hints and gestures.","I am deeply concerned about the impact of poverty on children because poverty can destroy their future and bind them to a life of misery.","I am grateful for my father's legacy. I am grateful to have found out who my real friends are. I am grateful for God's guidance.","I learned a lot about filmmaking from my dad. Starting when I was a child, I would listen to my dad as an actor, writer, director and producer talking about films - you know what the treatment would be in the opening, in the middle, and in the ending.","My favorite author is David Baldacci; I've read all his books. I even have a picture with Baldacci taken during his book-signing in the States.","If I think of all the family members, I was probably the only one who was excited with the possibility of my dad's entering public office.","Every worker needs a decent and legal source of income.","In many parts of Mindanao, brownouts are a frequent occurrence.","Filipinos should need no longer kill fellow Filipinos. With peace, real progress can touch all corners of the country.","Most movies now are drama, and the commercially successful ones are, sadly, about adulterous relationships.","I'm biased for movies that have triumphant endings.","I appreciate artistically made movies, but as an audience member, I want to be entertained, too.","Even if I aspired to be in showbiz, I felt physically inadequate being compared to my parents.","I am quite uncomfortable using legislation to peg the minimum wage.","Loyalty to the country does not end with territory. Sometimes you are elsewhere, but your heart is really for the country.","I will continue to help run my father's company.","It's important to have IT knowledge; it's important to increase every government agency's IT capability."],"Grace Slick":["I like being in a recording studio. I like watching a song go from the simplicity of the original music.","If you were to say to me that I couldn't paint, I would write. If I couldn't write, I would be a set designer. As long as I'm creating something, I'm happy.","In school, I learned about artists and how they were free to express themselves. I was allergic to conformity, and the lifestyle attracted me. I wanted to express myself in a way that slammed people up against the wall.","I think of myself as a positive agnostic. I don't know, therefore I'm open. I don't know, therefore I'm interested.","I don't miss anything about the 1960s, not really. I did it. It's like asking, 'Do you miss the fourth grade?' I loved the fourth grade when I was in it, but I don't want to do it again.","You either evolve or you don't. I don't like old people on a rock n' roll stage. I think they look pathetic, me included. And the fact that I represent an era means I can't just go out there and do all new stuff. They would all say, 'Sing 'White Rabbit,' and I'd say no? That's rude.","Through literacy you can begin to see the universe. Through music you can reach anybody. Between the two there is you, unstoppable.","I collect stuffed animals, and toy stores make me happy.","People say Altamont was the 'end of the '60s.' It was unfortunate, but at the time we didn't think of it as signaling anything. The fact that nobody got killed at Woodstock is amazing because that was half a million people. We only had 300,000 at Altamont.","I'm very fond of drugs.","When you get older, it's not about what you did that you regret, it's what you didn't do.","I find it amusing on one level, poignant on another, when people try to get recognition from an outside source. It's sad.","I am not strict vegan, because I'm a hedonist pig. If I see a big chocolate cake that is made with eggs, I'll have it.","'Feminist comedy,' practically an oxymoron, had a couple of good years after WWII. Chalk it up to the forced female autonomy that occurred during wartime, when Rosie the Riveter went to work in the factories, constructing the Allies' war machines while taking charge of the finances, the home, and the children.","Anyone who's 71 years old would look ridiculous singing rock.","No matter how big or soft or warm your bed is, you still have to get out of it.","When you learn that a truth is a lie, anger follows.","Through your life, most people peel away the junk that's not useful, that's superfluous. You are determined to peel that away. I do one thing at a time. One man at a time. One car. One house. One child. One job.","Woodstock - I didn't see anybody play, except when I was standing backstage waiting to go on, because it was so muddy. And the weather was so horrible, you literally couldn't get there except by helicopter.","The way I paint is similar to rock in that you don't stand around and say, 'Gee, what are they talking about?' Rock is simple, blunt, colorful. Same with my paintings. You don't stand back and wonder what it is. That's Jim Morrison, that's a panda, that's a scene on the West Coast. It's not abstract.","Being in a rock n' roll band was like being in a Sherman tank. Nothing got to you. You were surrounded and protected by men.","Applause is interesting, but I'm a monster with or without it. Something is either well written or it isn't. 'White Rabbit' is not well written, and no amount of applause or royalties can convince me it is. I could have done a better job with those lyrics. They didn't say what I wanted.","Old people should be heard but not seen. Young people should be seen, not heard.","The main point for me is moral; animals are sentient beings. I know for some this is a hard argument to accept, but we're not built to eat a lot of meat.","It takes a little work to be a vegan, but now it's really possible to have tasty stuff and it's better for you. I say the best test is go as far as you can and see how you feel. Personally, I feel great.","I didn't want to write a book. They made me do it.","If I were gay, life would be a lot simpler. I'm kind of annoyed that I'm not.","I don't imagine my parents are too excited about my kind of life. The surrounding weirdness bothers them. Still, I think they're pretty good. Their lives are based on what their friends think, just like ours are.","Things change so fast, you can't use 1971 ethics on someone born in 1971.","Prancing around on stage is not the entire purpose of my life.","I like Daughtry, I like Nickelback, I like Dave Matthews. I like Beyonce - she's a really good entertainer.","I don't want to see old people doing rap or rock and roll. It makes me cringe.","Rock & roll is not obscure, it's really easy to understand. So is my painting.","I do what I love to do, what I choose to do.","Death is like taking an intermission when you can't come back. I like living and being around.","I left rock and roll professionally at about 49. That's too long as far as I'm concerned. Some people can do it; it depends on what you were.","Jerry Garcia used to take his paints on the road. I don't do that. Either I'm a singer or a painter. I'm not good at multi-tasking.","You can do any number of things in the music business aside from trying to look like you're 25. To me it's embarrassing.","It's really a drag to sit around when you're old, and think, 'Ah, gee, I never went to France.' Go to France. Life is very short; you've got to pack it all in there.","One good thing about television is that you have a lot of people with money who have real good cameras going around to all these countries. You haven't been there? Great. Turn on The History Channel or The Discovery Channel. So, we're lucky in that way.","People ask me why I don't paint oils. It takes too long. Cleaning brushes in linseed oil, and it takes six months to really dry, and all this. I don't have that kind of time. I work with acrylic. It's water based. You can clean it under water. If you spill it on yourself, you just throw it in the washing machine.","I'm not very good at multi-tasking. Most people aren't, but they think they are. The mind is really better when you're really focused on one thing.","Woodstock is well known because this country is so hyped on amount. It was big. Half a million people doesn't necessarily mean something is good. It just means it's big.","My deal is that I pay more attention to whatever job I have than the relationships I have. Now, if I had considered my job to be a wife and mother, then I would have been pretty good at it. But I didn't consider it a job. I thought it was like brushing your teeth - it's not fun, it's just something you do to keep your teeth from falling out.","Jon Stewart, Bill Maher, Stephen Colbert. Those are the guys I look at who are telling me pretty much the truth. And they throw humor into it which makes it much more interesting to listen to.","My parents were very open about what kind of talent I had. They never pushed me to become an accountant because they knew that would be just absolutely ridiculous. So they were encouraging in what I am able to do with some success.","Some of us don't want to be a housewife. When you live alone, you can do anything you want to do anytime you want. I really like it.","You don't have to wear fur. They make such great fakes. There's no reason to kill an animal.","I'm a commercial artist, both in music and art.","There is an attitude that we should be able to have everything. No, you shouldn't be able to have anything. I'd like a helicopter, but I can't afford a helicopter, so I don't buy one. People are buying stuff they can't afford on credit. I bought my Ford hybrid with cash.","'Vegetarian' is a slippery word. I don't eat cheese, I don't eat duck - the point is I'm vegan.","You can't make people change, but the organizers of WorldFest hope that people consider being vegetarian for both moral and health reasons.","I fall down all the time because I'm such a klutz, but I have never broken a bone, and I don't eat milk or cheese ever. I like tofu cheese and soymilk in my coffee and cereal.","God is all over the place. And even if He isn't, if it makes me feel good, why not?","I think old people are scary. They remind you of your own death. People don't like to tell you that.","The word 'success' - who's defining it? It's about whether or not it makes me feel good. Four billion people don't have to see or hear it. If I've enjoyed the process of creation and I'm at peace, then what happens next is just entertainment. If mass appeal were actually something, Marilyn Monroe wouldn't be dead.","The problem with hanging on to the '60s is that everyone thought they would go on forever.","Mainly I make music, and you can do that until you drop dead.","I was a floor model at I. Magnin. I'm 5 feet 7, but my legs weren't long enough to be a big-time model. From the knees up, everything is long, but from ankle to knee, if I was in proportion, I'd be 5 feet 9.","'White Rabbit' was mostly done in about two days, the music in about half an hour. The music is a 'Bolero' rip-off and the lyrics a rearrangement of 'Alice in Wonderland.' You take two spectacular hits and throw them together, and it's hard to miss.","Starship was a whole different thing. It was pop rock. It made more money and had more hit songs than Airplane. There was no cultural or social ethic behind it. For me, it was like selling out. I was the only one selling out. The rest enjoyed doing what they were doing.","Too many people try to please their parents. My parents were Republicans, which is too bad, but they allowed me to be who I wanted to be.","If you don't own the stage, you shouldn't be in rock n' roll.","When I was between the ages of five and nine, the soldiers of the Second World War wanted to have Betty Grable, but I wanted to be Betty Grable. She was the epitome of an alluring woman; she had it all as far as I was concerned."],"Grace Zabriskie":["I do less waiting by the phone than anyone I know in the business. I don't wait for a job. I just go on to my own work.","Some people are suspicious of others who have more than one talent. I've had poets tell me to my face that an actress can't be a poet.","The fact is, as actors, everything we do, bad or good, is a contribution. To me, it is a positive thing to give people as wide a range of human behavior with some sense of understanding of that behavior or some clue to it."],"Gracia Martore":["Women need to be in key operational roles where they run businesses in the organization. Sometimes when organizations focus on leadership diversity, they're mostly in areas like HR or non-operating line functions.","It doesn't matter what your pedigree is, who your family is or what degrees you have. What really matters is how you perform your job and how you produce results. Whoever could do the best job, that's who the focus is on - and it definitely doesn't matter if I am a woman or a man.","Back when I was looking for my next step and was researching Gannett, I was interested in who was leading the various businesses within the organization: Are there a lot of women and minorities in important, operational roles, senior management and the board of directors?","If you're going to succeed, then you just have to be thick-skinned. It's something I developed early in my career, and it just goes with the territory.","News in printed form is in secular decline. However, news delivered the way consumers want it is growing and thriving.","Every day, all of us at Gannett are given the rare and sacred opportunity to affect change for the good in the communities we serve, to make life better for the people who trust us to know them and do right by them."],"Gracie Allen":["When my mother had to get dinner for 8 she'd just make enough for 16 and only serve half.","I really don't act. I just live what George and I are doing. It has to make some sort of sense to me, or it won't ring true. No matter what the script says, there's no audience and no footlights and no camera for me. There's no make-believe. It's for real.","When I was born I was so surprised I didn't talk for a year and a half.","This used to be a government of checks and balances. Now it's all checks and no balances.","Brains, integrity, and force may be all very well, but what you need today is Charm. Go ahead and work on your economic programs if you want to, I'll develop my radio personality.","Smartness runs in my family. When I went to school I was so smart my teacher was in my class for five years.","The President of today is just the postage stamp of tomorrow.","The on-stage Gracie may look poised, but the real Gracie is shy, a little self-conscious, and, before every performance of my life, panicky."],"Gracie Gold":["Always wear a smile because you never know who is watching.","I always wear my evil eye necklace to ward off bad karma. I always wear one to protect me.","If I were packing for a deserted island, I would bring sunscreen, a water purifier, something to start a fire with, my sister, and something for protection.","I always start my breakfast out with oatmeal, because it's full of vitamin D, it's a great carb, and you can get, like, some fun flavors in there.","Skating can make you feel athletic, graceful, beautiful.","I can't live without mascara and lipstick - every day.","Everyone has their dreams. I don't write my dreams down; they just live inside of me.","There are tons of great names who have gotten fourth at their first Olympics, and they just kept with it for the next quad. I'm among good company.","When it comes down to competition, it's not always about the best skater, it's about who skates the best in that competition.","The first thing I do when I get up in the morning is wash my face with Olay Regenerist Thermal Mini-Peel Face Wash. My skin is super-dry, and this one is great for basically any skin type. As you cleanse your face, the face wash gets warmer, so it's soothing and also has some exfoliation to it.","My favorite shampoos and conditioners are from Pantene's Damage Repair line, but I also love the Color Preserve Shine collection. I get highlights here and there to brighten my look, so the Color Preserve shampoo and conditioner is great for protection.","Someone named Gold has never won gold, I'm told.","I pretty much knew that I was going to come in fourth, but then I said, 'I'm fourth at the Olympic Games. What are you talking about? Why is that disappointing?'","I've been competitive since day one. Even in little things as a child, like having a twin and a direct competitor for who makes better cookies.","There is always the next big thing, the next big skater.","Everyone saying, 'She'll bring back women's skating. This will be the one to watch at the Olympics.' And they say things that are so far away, but really, you have to bring it back in and look at the next competition, the next day, what you want to accomplish because if you get too far ahead of yourself, you can trip yourself up.","I think that's something to look forward to: The new Gracie Gold at the Olympics. In 2014, you'll see a lot of the warm Gracie, and not just the athletic Gracie.","I definitely have two Olympics in me; I don't know about three Olympics.","While I circled around and around in my brown rental skates, I studied a group of skaters spinning in the center. I was fascinated! When my mom picked me up, I began a campaign for skating lessons.","It's just skating, and you're going to have a couple of mistakes. Even in practice, you're not hitting 100%.","Now that I have an Olympic medal in my room, it makes me hungry for another and a different color one.","My mom was born in San Diego, around Vista. So we've always been California people.","I always put a layer of lip balm first, and then I layer the lipstick on by using a lip brush to help get it into the whole lip and make a really even line.","Grace Kelly is my main inspiration, for her timeless beauty. I like Jennifer Lawrence for her fun, down-to-earth style, and Taylor Swift is always elegant.","Red certainly is the family color. From my mother and my grandmother, I've learned a lot of little tricks - the significance of color and lipstick being one of them. I started skating when I was eight years old, and my mom did my makeup for me back then.","Classic music will always come across better on the ice because skating has such a rich history, rooted in tradition.","My go-to is a red lip. It's a timeless fashion statement, and I've loved doing it ever since I was little. My favorite classic red is CoverGirl Lip Perfection in #305 Hot.","I always try to have a fun nail. It's something whimsical that you can pull off anytime.","A lip brush is really helpful when applying a red lip because it makes the lines smoother. You can see a bumpy line from really far away.","I love pop music... some hip hop... not super big into rap, but I love Rihanna. I love Alicia Keys. Rihanna was my first concert I went to. I love her.","It's kind of low brow, but the show 'Bob's Burgers' is hilarious, and being from the Midwest, I can kind of relate to a lot of the jokes. 'Orange is The New Black' is a Netflix Exclusive, I think - that's really funny.","'Pretty Little Liars' - my sister and I read the books, so we stuck to it for the first season, but it started to kind of drift off; so did we.","A lot of the off-ice is actually spent sort of as a recovery process. Because the closer we get to a competition, the more and more you do on-ice. So if you're already on the ice three to four hours, you get enough cardio doing your run-throughs. But I sometimes do the elliptical or bike.","I'm really all about clean eating, lots of fruits and vegetables. It's great, because in California, there are so many farmers' markets, so I always have plenty of fresh produce.","I'm an elite, recreational juggler.","In skating there's always another jump or another spin variation or another thing to learn, and that's what I liked about it.","I think if I just do what I do every day, on the extraordinary Olympic stage, I could be a podium contender.","I always wear a pair of colored jeans and fun boots. I have a really cute pair of stars-and-stripes Converse, and I love wearing all my bright Nike shoes."],"Graeme Base":["I have pets, but they're the really ordinary sort - yellow Labrador, tabby cat, white rabbit, a few goldfish - that kind of stuff. Nothing very... extravagant or unusual or exotic, but I find, in terms of inspiration, Mother Nature is just it.","I hope that there's a difference between being childish and childlike and that I'm the latter, if you take my meaning. I often sort of wonder. I don't think I'm a terribly good grown-up; I don't take responsibility easily or well in many areas of life. Finance and stuff like that, I'm absolutely appalling.","There's a book called 'Where The Wild Things Are,' by American writer Maurice Sendak... it really is the most sublime book. It's a picture book, but it works at so many levels, and it's fantastic.","Being an artist, it's all a journey, and you learn where the subtle patterns lie.","Ever since I was a kid, I might have been eleven or twelve. I'd be telling anyone who would listen that when I grew up, I wanted to be an artist.","You know I'm a bit of a dag because I listen to classical music. I recently bought myself an iPod and downloaded every piece of classical music that I had access to onto that.","I was born in Amersham, England on 6/4/58. My family moved to Australia when I was eight, and I went to Box Hill High School and then Melbourne High School. I liked to draw and write at school, and I liked books by J.R.R. Tolkien, A.A. Milne and Kenneth Grahame.","I was always interested in art at school, and after year twelve, senior year, I spent three years studying graphic design at college. I worked in advertising for two years but didn't like it much, then began doing a bit of illustration work for various publishers.","I began illustrating children's books because of a growing disillusionment with the sort of work I was doing in the advertising industry. Book publishing offered me the chance to be far more creative.","My only real hobby is playing music. I write a lot of music on guitar and keyboards and hope one day to make a record or maybe even write the score for a film.","I guess I don't come to the work without baggage. I have an idea of what I want my pictures to look like in my head, and if they don't match up, I find it frustrating.","I'm a relentlessly optimistic person, and I think 'The Waterhole' is a story of hope and that even though nature goes through cycles, we prevail in the end.","It's not even my job to educate, but what I do is try to facilitate by creating a book that works on different levels. I do want to entertain and bring some joy to the reading experience. If it holds a little kernel of knowledge that readers choose to explore, well, that's great.","It was always that detail that drove me. Ever since I was a little kid, I used to get into the nitty gritty... when I was drawing army tanks or monsters, I'd do every nut and rivet, and I'd do every scale on the dragon's back. It was just the way I was built.","People kept asking, 'What's your market?' I've got no idea at all other than me, an eleven year old kid in a 56-year-old body. But there are a lot of us out there.","Whilst I love still hiding... games and puzzles to play, I'm not as imprisoned by that need to fill every corner with detail.","Some people can sit and enjoy the view... some people like to take photos to feel complete. I need to somehow possess it in some other way. I just have to somehow grasp it and take it home in a more fulsome way. It's where ideas come from.","I've had an absolutely charmed life in every aspect of it. I do for my job what I would do for a hobby if it wasn't my job. Half the secret of happiness, I'm ecstatically happily married with three great kids, you know. It's been a blessed life.","I was eight when we came to Australia. It was five amazing weeks onboard this ship - it was the Northern Star.","The English probably do that wordplay kind of humour and whimsy better than anyone, and I've always felt that my writing goes more to that than what I did when I came to Australia.","I decided to take my foot off the pedal with all the detail. I'm sure after 'Animalia' and 'The Eleventh Hour,' readers thought that's what to expect from Graeme Base. With 'The Sign of the Seahorse,' I took a step away from the puzzle-book genre - that was more of an adventure story.","Whether one likes it or not, the screen is a profoundly important source of imagery and storytelling for this generation. For me, books remain a stunning place to tell stories, but the screen has a place."],"Graeme Le Saux":["I'd very much like to create my own style as a photographer, even if it's just for myself.","Training is such a vital part of preparation for a game, you really do train to play. It tops up your ability, like sharpening a carving knife. You can get away with not doing it for a while, as long as you have reached a certain standard of fitness.","We spent a lot of time on the beach when I was young so I'd also take pictures of seaweed and crabs.","When you live by the sea, there are definite seasons when you can see the weather coming and going, which lends itself to photography.","I've never put myself in the mindset that I'm actually any good at taking pictures, I just love to shoot things that catch my eye, whether it's landscapes or just my kids.","My wife Mariana is a good photographer too and, like me, she just picks up a camera and takes a picture when she sees something, rather than looking too deeply into it.","The problem for me is that I've never actually studied photography, so it's quite a steep learning curve. Cameras these days do so much for you automatically but I still think there's a point where you should actually know the technical side.","Digital has obviously changed things a lot, but not all for the better as far as I'm concerned. Of course it's much more convenient and you're getting instant results, but to me it just lacks the finesse of a roll of film and it has a slightly superimposed feel.","The first year I sold a photo to was a lady who thought I was a chef, for some reason. I've no idea why.","I was pleased that two very disparate photographs, two images that each worked in their own way had appealed enough to other people for them to buy them. I was also relieved they weren't the last ones purchased, and that they sold for a pound more than the frame was worth.","Sometimes I'll go by and there are a couple of swans, the next day it's a few ducks. I'd like to stop there every day for a year and capture how it changes, then put it all together to create an incredible image of a traditional English scene.","What it all boils down to for me is having the enthusiasm to do something for enjoyment and being stimulated by what's around you. That's what photography does for me.","You need to be an adrenalin junkie when you travel with kids.","Why go now? That is the question people asked when I announced I was retiring. A combination of things made me feel it was all drawing to a natural end.","In the last year my wife has noticed me struggling to get downstairs on a Sunday morning. I've two young children and football has been so good to me over the years I don't want to spoil it.","I've had one very bad ankle injury but otherwise I've been incredibly lucky with my fitness. I've worked hard at it and I've always been fit even compared to other players. That sustains you through various parts of your career, but I am 36.","So it was a hard decision but I know it is the right one.","From my point of view what I have to do now is appreciate and enjoy what football gave me, but now do something else with the same energy and enthusiasm I gave to football without expecting the same results."],"Graeme Murphy":["I think it requires a bit of honesty, Swan Lake.","And dance is wonderful because dance is so immediate.","But I also wanted to give them an intelligent emotional journey, without having to suspend reality - to be able to look at those characters and see reasons for the relationships and why what happens happens.","Yes, Carl Vine stuck around. He's now number one composer for choreography.","I mean, I think in the early days we were pretty... pretty British in our entertainment leads.","We moved, and there was a golden era in the '40s when we were so conscious of who we were as Australians.","I'm thrilled at the moment because our audiences, you know, they... the demographic is 50% male.","Dance is so joyous.","I actually build my dreams around the dancers I've got in my company.","And currently, there are four to five new works in the pipeline for upcoming celebrations such as the Sydney 2000 Olympics, Australian Federation, my 50th Birthday, and Sydney Dance Company's 25th Anniversary.","Sydney is a very good market for us - we have a very strong following here.","Normally our season is seven weeks in the Drama Theatre and four weeks in the Opera Theater.","We also tour nationally and internationally.","Mostly, I'm in the very enviable position that no one dictates what I do.","I look at the dancers and I get the inspiration for the work from them.","I always figure I have this tree and there's always some green fruit that's not ready to pick or blossoms that are ready to flower; there are always some ready to drop off too.","I'm in the position to pick the cream of the crop.","There's a line of dancers waiting to get into Sydney Dance Company.","I'm interested in people who can take the movement somewhere.","It's not a company of exponents of my style.","No one was creating and I always wanted to be created on.","SDC has a great reputation for putting live music on stage.","We can't afford big symphonies but we commission works that sound rich and symphonic because of the nature of the instrumentation and the people we work with.","I think the Olympics could help us reach more people.","I don't think people we'll miss the fact that SDC is way up there and that our profile is high.","If the year 2000 can help us move into the future, that's fine, but I am afraid that people see it as a full stop and that one can take a big breath afterwards - you can't.","It's the emotional trigger points that are important to me because I know if I could believe in the characters and try and imagine how they felt then I'd be able to do something quite honest.","I wanted to give people - which is fairly bizarre considering my whole life is contemporary dance really - I wanted to give people a really fulfilling sense that they had seen a white classical ballet - in a very pure form.","For me it was really important to get the essence out of the music for the story and not, sort of, press the music into the service of the whimsical telling of it."],"Graeme Simsion":["I worked in information technology and academia for a long time and met many people who were better with things and ideas than with people.","I set out to write a screenplay but, since my early 20s, had dreamed of writing a novel.","All of us have to make some accommodations and allowances if we are to live with another person.","Fortunately, I am accustomed to creating amusement inadvertently.","I feel I've done the 10,000 hours you have to do to get good at something.","A lot of romantic comedies are just light romantic dramas, or the comedy comes off second-best.","I am happy that I'm a better novelist than a screenwriter.","Interestingly for me, modern rom coms have not always been funny - many of the iconic rom coms are more like light dramas with occasional comedic moments, often coming from secondary character.","I am a big advocate of the role of the bookstore in the community.","There's definitely a role for online booksellers, but they can't host events, bring people together, and form a personal relationship in the way a bricks-and-mortar store and its staff can."],"Graham Brown":["Life is about choices. Some we regret, some were proud of. Some will haunt us forever. 'Black Rain' was very much about choices. The message - we are what we chose to be.","And almost always there has to be change, change in the characters is the journey - it's the story.","I wanted to be a pilot. I loved flying and I loved all the technology and the equipment and the sense of adventure that came with it. I think that feeling still bleeds over into everything I do today.","Writing itself is a dream. There are days of self doubt and deadlines and wondering how you're going to pay the bills until you write that bestseller. But it's still the best job I've ever had. I've also been able to help a lot of people and even inspire a few and that feels great."],"Graham Chapman":["There is no cannibalism in the British navy, absolutely none, and when I say none, I mean there is a certain amount.","All ideas come about through some sort of observation. It sparks an attitude; some object or emotion causes a reaction in the other person.","I can't talk to a man who bears an undeserved animosity towards ferrets.","We don't deliberately set out to offend. Unless we feel it's justified.","I hope I will have achieved something lasting.","World War II... did not happen to everyone, but it happened to most. There were people from Germany who were throwing bombs at us.","You know, Python should have won a Grammy for our musical work on the show.","It's nice to see that look of alarm on the faces of the others.","Dressing up as decrepit old ladies, and even decrepit young ladies, was one of our staples.","Death can really absorb a person. Lik most people, I would find it pleasant not to have to go, but you just accept that it's more or less inevitable.","Health care does not worry me a great deal. I've been impressed by some wonderful old people.","Stormy in love, stormy in interviews, breakfast in bed - that's me, love.","John Howard Davies was not a very human person... if you made a mistake of any kind, any sort of pause in speech, he would treat you rather as if he was a schoolmaster."],"Graham Coxon":["I've always looked at shoes as being immensely beautiful things.","I'm a bit of lunatic with shoes and jackets and jeans. It's just how I am.","Manchester has it's own pride and London has it's sort of pride and sometimes we can be a bit mean to each other, but I think if we dig the music we can get on really well.","A singer for me is more like someone who is standing alone with a microphone like Scott Walker, rather than someone who is bashing a plank and is spitting all over a microphone.","You know Manchester is always a bit of a hard place for people coming from London, just with all the history. Manchester has this immensely huge and healthy history musically.","With my daughter, who at the time was one, my domestic life needed to take more precedent and really with my own self I needed to develop quite a bit more. So that put Blur down the list of priorities quite a lot by the time I came to thinking about it.","When Blur first started and we were playing Manchester the Hacienda was the place to go. That was where a lot of exciting stuff was happening and London was pretty dead.","There's a focus that hasn't been there for ages and ages and some American bands are sounding quite English like they did in the late 70s and early 80s.","There were some extremely good teachers there that were great artists really in their own right. It was actually very hard to concentrate on getting down to going any work being an art student especially when it's a flighty thing at best.","There are a lot of people who can do it on the guitar and sing at the same time, but I think what is harder is bass players that can play the bass and sing.","Playing and singing at the same time is pretty cool, but sometimes it's difficult to know when you can just really let go a bit because you've got to get back to bloody microphone and sing some stuff.","Like, Mission Of Burma to me always sounded almost like they were part of the British Arty New Wave. I kind of like that. I like not being able to tell the difference.","It's the faster bands that made me want to play guitar, bands like The Jam.","It's the clothes that influence the music I'm going to play.","It's mostly Mars Bars and peanuts and cheese and you go to the fridge and there's Red Bull and Beer. It's not like people are holding me down and pouring beer in my face.","It's a bit loose and the people in my group have got other groups. They don't have to have a total allegiance to me. I think that's really a bit weird and showing some weird insecurity.","It was quite nice meeting up because we went through a lot together and we haven't really seen each much other to communicate one to one for quite a long time.","The other guys drink, but they don't drink anywhere near what I used to. And I think they're slightly respectful of the fact that I'm off it, so it's not a problem.","I'm still trying to discover my position on my own artwork and hopefully at this exhibition someone will come and tell me. I'm open to listening to criticism.","I'm still amazed by the process of recording.","I'm not going to pretend that I am the best thing in their life and they have to be totally loyal.","I think of someone like Mariah Carey as a singer.","I think now, more than anytime I can remember, bands are sounding pretty similar whether they're English or American, from Manchester or London... or Leeds or Welsh or Irish.","I think a lot of cynicism has dropped away from my shoulders since I stopped drinking.","I suppose my little Martin acoustic guitar is quickly becoming a prize possession. It's a lovely guitar. I bought it at the Cambridge Folk Festival in 2001 before I had cleaned up.","I sing, but I don't think of myself as a singer.","I love the magic of the studio.","I liked Germany; I'm not into Berlin, it's too huge and empty and imposing, but Munich was good.","I had a breakthrough, I think my life just became calmer, I gave up drinking. My priorities changed as I had a young daughter. The group didn't want me to record for the Think Tank album... so I took it as a sign to leave.","I don't think of myself as a singer really.","But live shows are cool. I just got back into the idea of enjoying it live.","Being a singer now I have to get all fussy... I must have my ginger and lemon and all that."],"Graham DeLaet":["Maybe playing in the NHL would be pretty nice, but that's more of a pipe dream for me.","It's important that I'm always playing fresh and that I'm ready to go rather than just playing because I feel like I have to.","It's hard not to chase the money. You sit at home when guys are out playing for a $6 million purse, and you know you're going to drop back on the money list, so you end up playing when you don't really want to.","I don't need to be too intense. I don't play my best golf when I'm super-intense.","I feel usually the strength of my game is my driving, and over the past - even since I was in college and everything, my short game has been the thing that's let me down.","Final pairing on Sunday in a PGA Tour event? If you can't get up for that, you better find something else to do.","My game is kind of built around hitting shots - that's what I take pride in, and it's what separates myself from other guys.","I was always a decent hockey player, but I'd have never made the NHL.","I never had the opportunity to pick up a golf club in school, and I think it is a cool thing for kids. Getting clubs in kids' hands is the only way to grow this game.","Golf is one of the greatest games in the world, not just on the course but what it can teach you off the course, the morals, stuff like that.","When I was growing up, golf was the geeky sport. No one really wanted to be associated with it.","I worked at the golf course, and I always had dreams and aspirations of being a professional golfer.","The most nerves I've ever felt on the first tee was at the President's Cup.","Everyone is going to make bogeys and doubles and get bad breaks in bunkers. It's just kind of licking your wounds and taking what it gives you and move on."],"Graham Elliot":["I only wear red socks in the kitchen. They bring me luck.","Barbecue is the good old technique of people making a fire and putting some stuff over the top - I mean, look at the S'more: it's just got a stick. A lot of those goofy toys, it's people who are looking at things to do. I think if you focus on the food, at the most you need tongs or a spoon to flip something; that's about it.","I really see food as subjective. It's a creative outlet. It's something that you do for fun. It's a gray area. It's not black and white or right and wrong.","I'm inspired by artists who use a limited palette, like painter Piet Mondrian, and the White Stripes, two musicians who create an incredible sound. Our food is starting to go back to a 'less is more' style.","You are defined by your ingredients, by the way you touch them, by the flavors you draw from them.","Kids see cooking as a creative outlet now, like soccer and ballet. It gives me hope that things like fast food, childhood obesity and the horrible state of school lunches can be addressed by kids and their parents.","I'm a traditionalist, so for me, black coffee is cool.","I think that expression is so great. So I'll look at someone like Prince, and one reason to lose weight is so I can rock that purple velvet outfit with the white frilly shirt.","Kosher salt, eggs and flour. These are the building blocks of everything. Kosher salt, above and beyond everything.","I have two bookcases that used to be filled with cookbooks, but now it's mostly books about politics and government. I might just give this all up and run for office.","I can't just sit all day on the couch and expect the weight to come off. My goals are my new focus instead of food.","I've traveled all over. I've been to all 50 states. With my dad in the Navy, I lived in the Philippines from nine to 12, and I had dog, monkey, lizard, everything. Then I was in Hawaii, and I'm spear-fishing, catching octopus with my hands.","I don't get to watch a lot of TV. I just do all my news and reading and 'Meet the Press,' all that fun, exciting stuff.","I'm in love with 'pure' flavors, things that are natural and delicious, minimally fussed with, that showcase the season.","I played the guitar and thought that was what I was going to do as a career. I still record music that is played in my restaurants.","Chicago's always been known as this meat and potatoes place, and a lot of restaurants play that up. They try to outdo each other by adding another 10 ounces, so their 80 ounce steak becomes a 90 ounce steak with 10 pounds of mashed potatoes on the side.","Even though I live in and love Chicago, I can't stand deep-dish pizza. I'm a New York-style pizza person.","Weight is something I've battled all my life.","I think that people are getting really excited about different ethnic food, and almost even micro-ethnic food. So it's not just, 'I love Asian,' it's Szechuan or Hunan, this one style from China.","I think the big things for me are trying to keep running and staying active, but not forcing to do one hour or five miles but really going out and doing it until you feel good.","I tried to start my own religion in high school. I was very eccentric. I've always loved attention.","Dining should be something that isn't always taken extremely seriously.","Food to me, in one word, is 'creativity' or 'expression.' It's simply, 'This is who I am at this point in time, and this is what I want to cook for you.'","I do take pity on some of the people that have to work with me.","Gray means being open-minded. I always look at the world that way; I'm able to hear both sides of an argument. I don't listen to opera, but I don't think it's good or bad; it's just its own thing. I can completely appreciate it.","I'd love to open a restaurant that changes every month. One month it would be a mom and bar spaghetti-and-meatball, Red Sox place, and the next it would be a British pub, and everyone gets in a fight.","I think that for me, growing up, my dad was in the Navy; we went all over the world. I love things the weirder the better. The idea I could eat things like snails or frogs legs or things like that was mind-blowingly cool.","I think what somebody orders and how they eat and cook really shows who they are.","I think that baseball as a whole, I am a huge romantic when it comes to the history and the stats and the numbers the stories behind it, so I would consider myself a pretty big fan.","Any time you can involve fake mustaches, things are just better."],"Graham Greene":["Human nature is not black and white but black and grey.","There is always one moment in childhood when the door opens and lets the future in.","In Italy, for 30 years under the Borgias, they had warfare, terror, murder and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love, they had 500 years of democracy and peace - and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.","They are always saying God loves us. If that's love I'd rather have a bit of kindness.","Success is more dangerous than failure, the ripples break over a wider coastline.","Heresy is another word for freedom of thought.","In human relationships, kindness and lies are worth a thousand truths.","Innocence is like a dumb leper who has lost his bell, wandering the world, meaning no harm.","God created a number of possibilities in case some of his prototypes failed - that is the meaning of evolution.","People talk about the courage of condemned men walking to the place of execution: sometimes it needs as much courage to walk with any kind of bearing towards another person's habitual misery.","My two fingers on a typewriter have never connected with my brain. My hand on a pen does. A fountain pen, of course. Ball-point pens are only good for filling out forms on a plane.","A murderer is regarded by the conventional world as something almost monstrous, but a murderer to himself is only an ordinary man. It is only if the murderer is a good man that he can be regarded as monstrous.","If you have abandoned one faith, do not abandon all faith. There is always an alternative to the faith we lose. Or is it the same faith under another mask?","The great advantage of being a writer is that you can spy on people. You're there, listening to every word, but part of you is observing. Everything is useful to a writer, you see - every scrap, even the longest and most boring of luncheon parties.","When we are not sure, we are alive.","Point me out the happy man and I will point you out either egotism, selfishness, evil - or else an absolute ignorance.","Morality comes with the sad wisdom of age, when the sense of curiosity has withered.","A solitary laugh is often a laugh of superiority.","In Switzerland they had brotherly love, five hundred years of democracy and peace, and what did they produce? The cuckoo clock!","No human being can really understand another, and no one can arrange another's happiness.","Against the beautiful and the clever and the successful, one can wage a pitiless war, but not against the unattractive: then the millstone weighs on the breast.","It is impossible to go through life without trust: that is to be imprisoned in the worst cell of all, oneself.","The world doesn't make any heroes anymore.","Writing is a form of therapy; sometimes I wonder how all those who do not write, compose or paint can manage to escape the madness, melancholia, the panic and fear which is inherent in a human situation.","Champagne, if you are seeking the truth, is better than a lie detector. It encourages a man to be expansive, even reckless, while lie detectors are only a challenge to tell lies successfully.","The economy of a novelist is a little like that of a careful housewife who is unwilling to throw away anything that might perhaps serve its turn.","The moment comes when a character does or says something you hadn't thought about. At that moment he's alive and you leave it to him.","Sentimentality - that's what we call the sentiment we don't share.","The truth has never been of any real value to any human being - it is a symbol for mathematicians and philosophers to pursue. In human relations kindness and lies are worth a thousand truths.","Unhappiness in a child accumulates because he sees no end to the dark tunnel. The thirteen weeks of a term might just as well be thirteen years.","I have often noticed that a bribe has that effect - it changes a relation. The man who offers a bribe gives away a little of his own importance; the bribe once accepted, he becomes the inferior, like a man who has paid for a woman.","Failure too is a form of death.","A petty reason perhaps why novelists more and more try to keep a distance from journalists is that novelists are trying to write the truth and journalists are trying to write fiction.","Innocence always calls mutely for protection when we would be so much wiser to guard ourselves against it: innocence is like a dumb leper who has lost his bell, wandering the world, meaning no harm.","Media is just a word that has come to mean bad journalism.","Reality in our century is not something to be faced.","He felt the loyalty we feel to unhappiness - the sense that is where we really belong.","We are all of us resigned to death: it's life we aren't resigned to.","A movie is not a book. If the source material is a book, you cannot be too respectful of the book. All you owe to the book is the spirit.","Thrillers are like life, more like life than you are.","Nobody thinks in terms of human beings. Governments don't, why should we? They talk about people and the proletariat; I talk about the suckers and the mugs. It's the same thing."],"Graham Hancock":["People think I'm a freemason, and I'm not. People think I believe the end of the world is coming on 21 December 2012, and I don't.","I see myself as a journalist reporting neglected stories about our past and trying to bring rigor, reason and intuition to the quest.","Many people say I believe aliens built the pyramids. I don't. In fact I'm not a supporter of the 'ancient alien' hypothesis at all. I think a lost human civilization is a much better explanation of the mysteries and paradoxes of ancient cultures.","I'm not an academic; I'm not an archaeologist. I'm a writer, communicating ideas to the public. There is a model of how the past is, and a lot of academic archaeology is about refining the model. It's not about changing the model radically. I'm not aware of any current which is about radically changing the model. It's just me, really.","It's odd that invoking the possibility of alien influences should itself be a sign of madness. I don't see the need for it to explain history on earth, but I can't see any reason why the universe shouldn't be full of life.","I'm somebody who explores extraordinary possibilities, not ordinary ones.","Whether Earth was deliberately terraformed, in other words, or whether it was seeded with the spores of life from crashed comets or whether, indeed, life arose here spontaneously and accidentally, it is reasonable to hope that we might find traces of the same kind of process on Mars."],"Graham Hawkes":["Everyone loves to fly, and flying underwater is even better than flying in air because there are things around you.","Space exploration promised us alien life, lucrative planetary mining, and fabulous lunar colonies. News flash, ladies and gents: Space is nearly empty. It's a sterile vacuum, filled mostly with the junk we put up there.","There's something just magical about flight. Period.","I don't have to be smarter than anybody else. I've just plain worked harder and longer than anybody else.","'Earth' is a silly name for this planet.","The Deep Flight Challenger technology is a game-changer for ocean exploration.","Scientists are always the ones who head into the ocean, but I want to take writers and politicians, people who can convey the beauty that is there and perhaps do something to take care of it.","One time on a dive, I wound up drifting up in darkness surrounded by billions of photoluminescent creatures. It was a religious experience, one only a poet could do justice to.","With the super-wealthy, I think what a lot of them want isn't things, it's experiences. Preferably ones that few people can have.","The ocean is this beautiful, unexplored place. Why on Earth everyone isn't down there, I don't know.","The crazy thing is we live on an ocean planet - nobody gets that yet.","Movies like 'The Abyss' and 'Jaws' make people think the ocean is threatening. It's not. It's very tranquil.","I grew up before computers. Computers are changing things, not all for the good.","Science is about filling in the details.","The bulk of life on Earth lives in a peaceful place where the temperature is stable. There's hunting going on, but it's very civilized, like a slow ballet.","Pressure hulls collapse at the speed of sound. Once that starts, you're inside your own little imploding atomic bomb, and you're gone.","If you go back to the early days of aviation, the guys designing it built it, and then they got in it and flew it. I mean, who does that anymore?","If you build a Model T and you can see the Camry, you don't spend time tinkering with the T; you go straight to the next thing. Once you build the Camry, you can see the Ferrari, so you go straight to that.","I think the future of this planet depends on humans, not technology, and we already have the knowledge - we're kind of at the endgame with knowledge. But we're nowhere near the endgame when it comes to our perception. We still have one foot in the dark ages."],"Graham Joyce":["Perhaps writers should never be allowed to get together in a workplace context. It's not like studying computer science, after all. The emotions are at large, and are shared and are questioned. There is a vulnerability.","The overintellectualization of surrealism can be a bromide. A dream interpreted is a deflated dream.","Fantasy gets a mixed reception - a lot of fantasy is formulaic but most of the award-winning fantasy on the contrary tends to be the stuff at the edges of the genre, rather than swimming in the middle.","George Orwell's '1984' frequently tops surveys of our greatest books: it's not a celebration of poetic language. It's decidedly anti-literary, a masterpiece of personal and political narrative sequence. And its subject matter is crucial, because what '1984' shows is that language can be a dirty trick.","Recasting fairy tales has become a publishing sub-genre in itself, and has been done both well and to the point of entropy. More interesting are those works where the structures of fairytales are abandoned but the world of 'fairy' is imported as a delicate spice.","I've been a professional writer for 20 years, and there are contours in that time, crescents and troughs.","It's just that to a lot of British people George Bush represents the worst of all things American. He's the right-wing Christian crusader, the toxic Texan who refused Kyoto, the poll-cheat eel who undermined democracy on the back of something called 'chads,' a notion we've never entirely grasped.","'Plutocracy.' It has a perfect nuance: chilly, inaccessible, icy-rich.","The poetry and transgression that was so much of surrealism's anarchic force has been recruited into mainstream culture. It has been made commonplace by television and magazine merchandising, by computer games and Internet visuals, by film and MTV, by the fashion shoot.","Every day the eye is subject to a thousand tiny shocks as a thousand industries compete for the eye-kick, the visual hook that will lock the consumer into product for that crucial second where the tiny - or not so tiny - leap of the imagination is made.","Repression in the human psyche is tightly bundled. When it has been pulled out of the sprung package so often it is perhaps difficult to push it back in the box.","It is, of course, the first recourse of every elitist to see social barbarism in others.","I'd defend the right for any novelist to experiment with form or language, but if people don't take to it, don't react by making out that they are thick.","If critics of 'readable fiction' want literature to change the ways people dream, they need first to come down from the mountain and speak to the people.","I've been playing 'Doom' for some years.","Since I've been hired to contribute to the storyline of 'Doom 4' I can say what was always true anyway. I'm working. You see, for a writer, lots of stuff that doesn't look like working is actually working. Looking out of the window, for example. Balancing a pencil on the edge of the desk in order to find its exact fulcrum. Playing 'Doom.'","My story reflexes come less from fantasy or horror than from the darker sort of psychological thriller - not as plot-driven as most, rather more mood-driven. My interest in the supernatural is a complication - though I am less interested in ghosts than in people who see ghosts.","Rome is a place almost worn out by being looked at, a city collapsing under the weight of reference.","If I couldn't get published tomorrow I'd still be writing. It's something to do with feeling so overwhelmed by this experience of life that you have to tell someone about it, and in a way that reorders the experience to make it manageable.","I have to get out once a week and speak with people or I start thinking I'm the emperor of Abyssinia.","Our literary culture is marinated in deep traditions of the fantastic and the supernatural, and we export those rich qualities in films and books on a spectacular industrial scale."],"Graham Kennedy":["I'd rather you didn't talk, but it's up to you.","There are no limits, love, there are no limits.","You know this old style of American family series? Well, I sit there and cry.","You didn't want to laugh, did you? It wasn't very funny, was it?","I never, absolutely never, keep people waiting.","I emphasise the following: don't, whatever happens, be anyone but yourself. Don't act anyone else-that would be fatal.","Many people think I'm a television personality. I never have been! Just someone who acts it.","When my mother died, I had to go on air that night and do jokes.","I terminated the interview when I didn't know what he was talking about and went upstairs to lunch.","Don't get too close, it hurts."],"Graham Kerr":["The internet has become such a great tool not just for chefs but for everyone. The net has given everyone the tools to see and almost experience new and different ideas.","All my jobs have been with food in one way or another since 1948. My parents were in the hotel business, and I just loved the warm hearted people who worked so hard with such good humor.","I do the cooking at home. Where we eat no more than 100 grams of meat a day and have 'tons' of fresh vegetables. I prepare the vegetables with a wide range of herbs, spices and such. We also keep on hand lots of fruit, yogurt and great breads."],"Graham McTavish":["I have done hard jobs in the past, and acting isn't one of them.","I came home for a week after I finished filming 'Rambo' because, after being in the jungle for three months, all I wanted to do was walk in the Highlands.","I am the complete and utter definition of a Luddite.","Technology is at the forefront of everything these days - communication, work. It's amazing and scary at the same time how robots have evolved, but I find it hard to believe that robots will completely rule the world. Not in my lifetime anyway.","Just the idea to have everything you need essentially stored in one piece of portable technology is very exciting."],"Graham Moore":["I believe in traditions; I believe in the idea of things being passed between generations and the slow transmission of cultural values through tradition.","Alan Turing is so important to me and to the world, and his story is so important to be told, so it was a big thing to take up, and I was a little petrified. Like, who am I to write the Alan Turing story? He's one of the great geniuses of the 20th century - who was horribly persecuted for being gay - and I'm a kid from Chicago.","When you use the language of 'fact checking' to talk about a film, I think you're sort of fundamentally misunderstanding how art works. You don't fact check Monet's 'Water Lilies.' That's not what water lilies look like; that's what the sensation of experiencing water lilies feel like. That's the goal of the piece.","I had been a lifelong Alan Turing obsessive. Among incredibly nerdy teenagers, without a lot of friends, Alan Turing was always this luminary figure we'd all look up to.","I think I always felt like an outsider, like a weirdo.","Depression is internal. The upswings and downswings have pretty much nothing to do with what's going on in the external world. It's not like something sad happens to you and then you feel sad. Good things happen, but you feel sad anyway.","The enduring appeal of mystery stories for all of us is that the world is a pretty confusing place. There's a lot of really unanswered things, and perhaps the scariest notion would be that there might not always be answers out there for us.","Telling Alan Turing's story in a two-hour film was a tremendous challenge. It felt in some small way like our filmmaking version of breaking the enigma code.","I feel very Midwestern at my core.","I liked Columbia, but it was like high school in that there was this big social world that I was not part of. I existed on the side, far away. That might be temperamental, my own fear of large groups, more than anything else. But I had a handful of professors who meant a lot to me.","Being bad at stuff is hard, and we all deal with it every day because we're all bad at stuff.","My mother, she worked in the mayor's office in Chicago when I was growing up and has been in democratic politics for a long time.","I was a sound engineer. That was my day job when I started writing.","I like historical things; I like researching things.","The representation of gay characters on screen is important for us all to think about because there are sadly too few representations of gay characters on screen in mainstream cinema. If Marvel starts making movies about gay superheroes, then we'll be in a really great place. We're not at that place.","I had first heard about Alan Turing when I was a teenager. I've known about him since I was a kid, and I always wanted to write about him.","When I was a teenager, I was a huge computer nerd. I went to computer programming camp. I went to space camp.","Space camp was actually, like, the best summer of my life. It was amazing. But I thought I wanted to be a computer programmer, and among computer science folks, Turing is this object of cult-like fascination.","Over the years, I would go to my agents, my manager, and I would say, 'Hey, there's this amazing true story about this gay English mathematician who committed suicide in the 1950s.' And they would be like, 'Please don't ever write that script. That is an unmakeable film.'","The only way for something human to feel human is to convince others that it is.","I did an adaptation for a movie called 'The Devil in the White City' by Erik Larson for Warner Brothers. I love that book.","I think we all feel like weirdos for different reasons.","Among tech-minded kids, I think Alan Turing was a tremendous inspiration. He was a guy that was so different than the people around him. He was an outsider in his own time, but because he was an outsider is precisely why he was able to accomplish things nobody thought was possible.","Britain in 1939 and 1940 really thought they were going to lose the war. It looked like they were going to lose. There was bombing every day, and people were literally starving.","I felt like Alan Turing's story was such an important story to tell, and it was so wonderful to write the script and other people find it and say, 'I never heard this story.' It's such an amazing story that people don't believe it.","If you know someone's secret, what power does that give you? How much power does that really give you? What can you do with secrets?","I was not a successful TV comedy writer.","Turing was always a legend among computer/geeky kids. He was such an outsider in his own time, and because of that, he was able to see things differently. It was a story that had been well told in books, onstage and on TV, but never on film.","I have writer friends who go to the premiere of a film with their name listed as the writer, but they are shocked: 'That's not what I wrote!'","I think everyone practices their Oscars acceptance speech with a shampoo bottle, and I've done my fair share of them. It's really surreal to be able to do it in real life.","When I first starting writing, and no one was paying me, in order to feel like I had a real job, I would get out of bed, put on a jacket and tie every morning, and sit down at my desk.","I'm just this committed dilettante. I think what I've found is that I've tried to do a lot of different things in my life and discovered I'm not as good at them as I'd want to be.","Everyone has strange teenage years. It's not like I can claim some particularly unique set of high school horrors. I think I was just an awkward kid who never felt comfortable in his own skin. I think I was alone a lot by circumstance and then by choice.","In my experience, depression was not something that has been cured so much as managed, like a lot of illnesses.","I'm not gay, but I don't think you have to be gay to have a gay hero. Growing up, Alan Turing was certainly mine. I'm also not the greatest mathematician of my generation. We have lots of biographical differences, but nonetheless, I always identified with him so much.","Depression is something I've dealt with every day of my life.","'The Imitation Game' is a celebration of Alan Turing's life and legacy, and Joan's final monologue is our eulogy. It's the thing we all wished we could have said to him.","We always knew that we didn't want to show Alan Turing in the act of suicide - it was our feeling that would tip over into melodrama too quickly and seem over-the-top.","Alan Turing, to me, always felt like an outsider's outsider.","If you're going to make a film, and you're going to have dialogue, and you want to take the characters seriously, let's understand what they're saying. If there is going to be technical dialogue, let's render it in a way that the audience can understand it and expect that it's not going to be so far over their heads.","When I think of Sherlock Holmes, I think of a guy who can wander into the confusion of life and sort of pluck out answers at will.","Everyone remembers the pop-quiz hotshot bit from 'Speed' because it's extremely funny, and it's really smart and really witty. And the notion that action movies can have dialogue that pops just as well as the explosions is something that I hope more people continue to remember.","One of the tricky things about sort of larger, comic-book action movies is that the scale is so big that they have to save the world at the end of every movie, and so at the end of each of the films, either Chicago or New York end up getting obliterated.","I'm always much more interested in flawed heroes than in perfect ones.","One thing that I always loved about, say, 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', is that Indiana Jones gets the Ark of the Covenant about sixty percent of the way through the movie. And then the rest of it is get-out-alive. To me, that's really cool. Because he's the one you care about at the end of the day.","A lot of biopics to me feel very much like someone is standing in front of the camera and is reading a Wikipedia page to you, like someone is reciting event. Did you know this happened? Did you know that happened? But Alan Turing's life deserved a sort of passionate film, and an exciting film.","I love the filmmaking process. It can be loud sometimes, and people love having conference calls, so working on a book is the polar opposite. It's very relaxing.","I started a novel right before 'The Imitation Game,' so it's funny now, four years later, to be coming almost back to finishing it."],"Graham Nash":["We can't forget what happened on May 4th, 1970, when four students gave up their lives because they had the American constitutional right of peaceful protest. They gave up their lives. And to sing that song in that spot on that anniversary was very emotional for us.","When I was born in 1942, World War II was still going. And I began to realize when I became a young adult that if we don't teach our kids a better way of relating to their fellow human beings, the very future of humanity on the planet is in jeopardy.","I'm not so sure that people consider homelessness to be as important as, say, the Vietnam War. One should never even try to equate them because, of course, they're tragedies on both sides of the coin.","I've been a photographer all these years... I haven't been in my own darkroom for 10 years.","We want to get this good music to as many people as possible because I think it heals, it soothes, I think music is incredibly important, especially in today's chaos.","I'm trying to communicate here. I'm a communicator, I like to communicate, and if a million people buy it then we've touched a million people, if only 10 people buy it, then we've only touched 10, and that's important, because I'm satisfied with only 10. But, I love a million.","This digital world is completely fascinating to me.","There are always new things to experience, internalize then write about. This process is ongoing with me. It never stops. The opportunity to reach new audiences with all of the music that we have made is thrilling.","Neil's effect on the band was immediate and very fulfilling. He adds a certain edge to the sound and, of course, he is an incredible musician. We became a better band because of the inclusion of Neil Young.","After six or seven performances of any song, you begin to perform it rather than feel it.","We are excited about the music, past and present and future, and are really looking forward to playing.","Being in a different band always brings great musical experiences to be able to draw on.","There is a great correlation between music and images.","Generally, my writing is influenced by living, by absorbing everything that happens to me and my actions.","I wasn't thinking of the longevity of any of my songs, but I am extremely pleased with the lasting effect.","One can't deny what has happened to us in the past. The secret is to enjoy and be proud of the music we've created and the people with whom we have been linked. It's all a long chain of involvement in the world, and we are proud to be yet another link in this chain.","I find it somewhat difficult to write with other people, although it has happened occasionally.","People like Beck and Shawn Colvin are some of the people I listen to lately.","If I read or listened to critics of our music, I'd have been discouraged a long time ago.","You know, every year has been fantastic for me, I'm still here, I'm still alive and it's been fantastic.","I worked very hard on me and David's record and I'm extremely proud of the record, as most people are who were involved with it. And, it's been wonderfully received by people who like our kind of music, they think it's something special, and so do I.","If you don't want to be there, it shows in the energy that you put out and in your actions.","I realized at one point that David and I had not made a record together in almost 26 years and I thought that that was absurd because, first of all it had gone so fast, I didn't really realize, neither did David, that it had been that long.","All the signs were right. And when I mean all the sings were right, the only signs that we care about when we start a project of making a record is, do we have the songs - it's that simple.","We only had enough money really to cut 10 things and be in there for a month because it's expensive, you know. And, singer/songwriters, today are lucky if they can get a deal, you know. So, we actually worked so fast that we really cut 20 things.","You don't get on your feet if you don't have to, you know. And these people were on their feet rockin', and that was thrilling for David and I, absolutely.","We seem to somewhat be behind an eight ball, and what I mean by that is we're constantly waiting for a call from Neil as to whether he wants to do CSNY.","With Crosby, Stills, and Nash and Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young... we're very strong individuals, and we want our lives to be led the way we want them to.","I fail to see the issue that will shock the people of this great country of ours into some decisive action.","I think Stills has been playing better than ever. I know a lot of it sounds self-serving, but he truly has.","I've been listening to a lot of Hollies stuff lately, and it's beginning to sound pretty good to me.","I don't have to ask anyone's permission to do anything. It's nice not have to get decisions out of three, sometimes four people, which can be like pulling teeth. So the amount of control that I have over what I'm doing is better for me as a solo artist.","I only do solo albums when songs are screaming at me to be let out of my mind.","If every human being disappeared off the face of the earth in an instant, the earth would still keep spinning and the planet would develop new life forms.","Just with the basic one guitar, one piano and one vocal and an audience, I think that the intimacy comes through more. People feel much more connected to the song because there's nothing in the way, and I actually enjoy doing that.","I mean, there's times to rock and roll, and I love that too. But I think my first love is acoustic music.","Martin guitars have now brought out, you know, on a more traditional level, the Stephen Stills' model of Martin guitars. It's beautiful. I just went inside. I bought one immediately.","The Hollies, after I left in 1968, had the audacity, the gall, to have three number one records after I left. Thanks a lot, guys."],"Graham Nelson":["I don't really believe in 'directions' in art; the rope twists as you follow it, that's all.","The 'interactive fiction' format hasn't changed in any fundamental way since the early 1970s, in the same way that the format of the novel hasn't since 1700.","Then in my early teens, when the home computer bubble was blowing, I had one of the first, an Acorn Atom, and used to write primitive adventures on that.","A deliberate choice on my part was for the player to continue to find new possibilities in the early Attic rooms far into the game. I think this builds atmosphere, though it means there's no neat division of the prologue from the middle game.","At the end of April I archived 'Curses' and Inform, and announced them on the newsgroups.","By the new year of 1994, it had grown up into Inform 4 and could produce games twice as large.","Eventually I found it had been working all along-but didn't show anything on screen until it had the first full page of text. I inserted 30 new lines, and suddenly my toy said 'hEllO woRlD'. An hour later I understood alphabet shifting rather better!","For a fortnight nobody at all emailed me, or posted a follow-up. Doesn't anyone care, I thought? It turned out my newsreader was broken, and hadn't posted at all.","I like to employ a form of repetition, in which the same elements recur but in different and unexpected ways. rather than being discarded as soon as they are understood or passed over.","I try to make puzzles range all the way from easy to hard, and to leave many open at once.","I'm rather pleased with the new manuals. I see Inform now as a gauche young adult, having got past the stage of growing out of his shoes every few months.","If pushed, though, I'd say that the next stage will be reached when it it's no longer true that about 75% of the best games were written in 1980's on the way to that.","If you're setting a game during the Cuban Missile Crisis, look through a library. find out what people were wearing, what other issues were in the news, how houses were furnished, what cars were being driven. Especially include things which now seem foreign.","Players very widely disagree with me about what's hard and what's easy. and in a way, 'I won, but it was a fight' is the best compliment a game can receive.","The most frequent complaint is that it's hard. True. it's a hard game to win Also, many people ask me how to use the secret debugging commands, apparently under the impression that I'll tell them.","The time has mainly gone on getting Inform into a decent shape for public use. I suppose the plot of 'Curses' makes a sequel conceivable when compared with, say, the plot of 'Hamlet' but none is planned.","This means keeping many trails open at once, inevitably requiring a fairly 'parallel' plot. This plot should be discovered rather than announced, so show, don't tell.","What I would pay much more attention to are the few points where the player can inadvertently make a career decision. Most players end up back-tracking, though some actually enjoy this.","Writing a really general parser is a major but different undertaking, by far the hardest points being sensitivity to context and resolution of ambiguity."],"Graham Norton":["Do I have more depth than I'm given credit for? No!","Basically, I'm a really bad interviewer. I love meeting celebrities, but then I get a bit bored. Once you meet them you thing, 'really, what an ordinary person'.","I don't think I've got bad taste. I've got no taste.","All my day is spent dealing with other people. When I come home I like it to be empty. The presence of others in my house kind of annoys me. I love coming home and shutting the doors. I feel brain dead. I'm relatively available, but not to live with.","In terms of language, yeah we get bleeped and blurred and things, but in terms of content, I would probably say we're getting away with more here than we could get away with in Britain. And that surprised us so much!","The only people who are desperate to go on the show are people we're desperate not to have on the show.","My ambition was to stop waiting tables. That was how I measured success: finally, I was able to stop waiting tables, and I was able to pay the rent, and that was by being a stand-up comic. Not a very good stand-up comic, but good enough to make a living.","Occasionally the state of the planet can knock me off my perky perch.","I'm often dating people, but I don't say it because you sort of know it won't last long.","I've so exceeded what I ever wanted to do.","You don't want money to make you a social freak where you can only hang out with rich people.","I bet Maurice Gibb's heart monitor was singing the tune of Stayin' Alive.","I was a failed actor but I still wanted to show off, so I ended up doing live comedy.","My mobile rang around lunchtime one day, and it was George Michael. He wanted to come in on Friday. We were like, 'okay, if that's what you want'. And he was a very good guest. That's a real exception to the rule.","The people I want are very famous and very rich, and all I can offer them is a bit of exposure on TV and a bit of cash, so it's a miracle we get any guests at all. But we have been very lucky.","I think the word is adult!","A comedian's a comedian. They're a very kind of cynical bunch. I guess that's why I like them.","Britain's such a twisted, weird little place.","I am very quick to judge.","I spent a long time working in restaurants and making no money. It was very character-building, but I think it could have been built in a shorter time.","Forty freaked me out. I didn't see it coming. My life was in a state of chaos - I was moving jobs and moving house - and it just hit me like a ton of bricks.","If you'd told the young Graham Norton that I'd one day have this amount of money, I'd have assumed it would have come from a lottery win.","All these people I interview are worth ten times what I'm worth.","I always say I'd rather be miserable by myself than unhappy in a relationship.","I'm actually quite self-sufficient, so it might look as if there isn't room for anyone in my life. That isn't entirely the case.","If it was possible for me to adopt, I probably would, but no one's going to let me adopt.","I have nothing to say about my childhood. It was a perfectly pleasant upbringing - it's not like it was unhappy or anything.","My life could have been so grim... really, really grim.","I'd like to retire at 50 but I don't want to sell papers in the middle of London on a Zimmer.","I am really bad at actually interviewing people.","The BBC will always be attacked by whoever is in government. It is that George Bush thing of 'If you're not with us you are against us.'","The BBC is a victim of its own independence.","Straight men just can't imagine the bliss of being in a relationship with someone who finds farting as funny as they do.","The higher your profile becomes, the more aware you are that people out there might hate you.","Tolerance is forced on people in London.","It sounds deeply shallow, but for brief spells every member of the public can be fascinating.","I've heard other gay people say when they were growing up they felt 'foreign.' Growing up, I was able to label these feelings as: 'I'm a Protestant.' It wasn't until I left, I thought: 'Oh, those weren't Protestant feelings.'","I don't think anyone wants to be gay.","Some people think they're depressed and they go to the doctor and want pills. And you just think: 'You hate where you live, you've lost your job, your boyfriend has dumped you, could all this be why you're depressed?'","It's amazing how I can just ramble on for hours, isn't it? And so unentertaining or uninteresting. But I can ramble on for hours. It's a sort of terrible gift, isn't it?","I don't think you should have to try to be nice, I think most people are nice. I think being cheerful and nice is just a politeness.","It's lovely to get one successful show - the chances of finding a second one are not so hot.","Where I get bored is when I show up for a shoot and they want me to wear a feather boa. Too obvious a thing for a poof on the telly to do.","I am camp. Lots of gay men can't cope with their campness. They are in denial about it.","Because society places a value on masculinity, gay men aspire to it. If you go to a gay club and the doorman says, 'You do realise this is a gay club, don't you lads?' you get all excited because you think, 'Wow, he thought I was straight!'","I do get pleasure from very inconsequential things, like shopping for clothes.","An awful lot of female celebrities are very beautiful whereas a lot of male celebrities are not so hot.","You don't want to be hard to look at. Plain very good, hard to look at bad. The plain shall inherit the earth; time is our friend.","One of the great things about being gay and out is that the papers couldn't care less about your love life.","All my interesting stories are from before I was on television. Nothing interesting has happened to me since then. Maybe it's because the most interesting thing in my life is the show and that's on telly.","I loved Lucille Ball growing up.","My parents grew up working class, but in that way that working class families do, they spent a fortune on education to better me.","Those years between drama school and getting onto the stand-up circuit were pretty lean.","Well, certainly I think American television is - that's proper TV."],"Graham Parker":["I never learned music. I'm quite uneducated, and usually I sat in front of the TV, with soap operas on, in England. It was very inspiring for me, I'd done all this traveling around, I came back living with my parents, everyone around me was like they're living in a soap opera.","Oh, man, pop singers are terrible actors. We're all bad.","I do not wanna write a song like 'Coathanger' so Andrew Breitbart can rage against me on his web site. It's not my idea of fun.","In the early days, I had very little idea about arrangements, and I wrote songs a little flat, as it were, just on an acoustic guitar. They didn't really have quite enough nuance.","Mostly I've never let record companies become involved with my music, which was a very smart thing that my first manager Dave Robinson did, to keep them out of it.","When I was a kid in the mid-'60s, I was what's known as a moddie boy, a prototype skinhead. You all had your hair like a crew cut, cropped, with suits or Levis with red suspenders, sometimes Doc Martens. It was a thriving soul music, Motown and ska scene; we used to dance to Prince Buster and the Skatalites.","I went to Morocco, joined a band called Pegasus, ran out of money, went to Gibraltar and worked on the docks, writing songs about the sun and the morning and the birds.","I started to work up in my old bedroom, playing, writing songs, and it somehow came to me that I could introduce soul music. Nobody seemed to be doing that."],"Graham Patrick Martin":["I think my concerns are the same as every actor. Can I find this character and make it come to life properly?","Everyone has their own process.","It's wild to be visiting New York and crossing the street and having someone yell out at me, 'Hey, Rusty!' Or to be recognized when I go out as 'the kid on 'Major Crimes.''","It's hard to say what you learn acting a part. You find bits and pieces of yourself that are inside the character you play. You locate the relatable aspects of that character to your own life. So, in a way, every part you play forces you to discover things about yourself you might not have learned otherwise."],"Graham Phillips":["My parents walked in on me Googling 'agents for kids' when I was 9.","I think that the reason why 'Goats' is called 'Goats' is because you can't give direction to goats. They do what they want. That's the point of this film.","Animals are the best actors. They never lie, they're always present, and they listen. That's a lot more than a lot of actors can say for themselves.","My character on 'The Good Wife' is a smaller character, and his story arcs are typically season-long, unless it's a big episode for him. His transitions take place over many, many hours.","The only reason why you should do a film is because it creatively carbonates you and gets you going. If you're doing it for any other reason, you've lost sight of why you're acting in the first place.","With film, you read the whole script three or four times, and you really have a solid blueprint of who your character is. Whereas in television, that blueprint is constantly changing and adapting, and sometimes you have to take a risk.","Eventually I'd love to be able to direct.","The caliber of actors I'm getting to work with and learn from on a daily basis is phenomenal for me as a developing actor."],"Graham Roberts":["Football is a game of skill, we kicked them a bit and they kicked us a bit.","I earned the right to get in the team, and fought every game to be in it.","Every game I played was a bonus.","The worst thing Spurs ever did was get rid of Keith Burkinshaw. They have never replaced him.","Every week Rangers have different former players come out at half-time. Spurs should have a couple a former players on the board, who know what the supporters want.","I work hard. I work 80-90 hours a week in part-time football.","I find young kids. I enjoy coaching and enjoy making them better players.","My ambition is to go back to Spurs and Rangers in some capacity and give something back that they gave to me.","I would run through brick walls for Spurs.","Spurs haven't got the funds they need so success has to be achieved gradually.","I thought we were going to win the game but we won't take the disappointments, we will take the positives.","I'm a Rangers fan and I love the club but this will be a difficult game.","But Rangers don't need to go there and win, they need to go there and get a point. I think the hardest thing about it is there will be no supporters. Playing in an empty ground will be a problem for the players.","I'm sure Alex will be having to get the masseurs in to work on those legs. You feel tired when you're losing but when you are winning it gives you that bit of an edge."],"Graham Russell":["The name Air Supply sort of came from nowhere. I get a lot of my things in dreams and I just had a dream about it one night, and I woke up and said that's just got to be the name. That was in 1975.","I like kind of varied songs, not just the same song all the time. And I thought things like 'Too Sentimental' is a different thing for us, but it works and we love the way they all came out. There's definitely varied songs on there.","I think for anything to change, in the real world, people have got to change on the inside and that's what we want to start, to get people to think and do more themselves and get involved in whatever they want to get involved with.","I'm a big fan of simplicity, especially with songs and I try not to make them complicated. I just make them simple and let people absorb that message themselves. That's my theory.","I think with any songwriter the first 1,000 songs are always terrible.","I think 'All Out of Love' is my favorite song because it's been the most successful. It's been in about 30 movies, it's been a number one record, and it keeps getting played on the radio, it's always somewhere.","I think about everything first. I think about the scenario: the story and the characters, what I'm trying to say and I'll think about that for a couple of days until it's all locked in and then when I get to an instrument it'll just fall out. But the song's kind of all ready there in my head.","We sing songs about love because we love the people we sing our songs to!","Australians are very provincial in many ways. If they feel that you've used them as a stepping stone to bigger things, they resent it.","I'm a big techno fan. I love that thumping kick drum. We heard a version of 'Lost in Love' and it was thrash metal. It sounded cool!","I write every day.","I'm playing great music with great people and so there's no reason to stop."],"Graham Swift":["Possibly he knew, as he wrote this, that he was mad - because inside every madman sits a little sane man saying 'You're mad, you're mad.'","I'm not a writer who looks for the fantastic and the sensational. I like the world we've got. If there is anything special and magical, I have to find it in the ordinary stuff.","It can be dismaying, all the same, for a novelist to compare the slowness of the writing with the speed of the reading. Novels are read in a matter of days, even hours. A writer may labor for weeks over a particular passage that will have its effect on a reader for an instant - and that effect may be subliminal or barely noticed.","The real art is not to come up with extraordinary clever words but to make ordinary simple words do extraordinary things. To use the language that we all use and to make amazing things occur.","People die when curiosity goes.","All nature's creatures join to express nature's purpose. Somewhere in their mounting and mating, rutting and butting is the very secret of nature itself.","My upbringing was absolutely not the archetypal writer's upbringing. Even, arguably, the opposite.","I had a fear of becoming anything, a fear of becoming a specialist. I might have become a doctor, but if you become a doctor, that's your specialty in life and you are defined by it. One of the attractions of being a writer is that you're never a specialist. Your field is entirely open; your field is the entire human condition.","I came from a lower-middle-class postwar family in a time of austerity and retrenchment, with no one in the family who was in any way artistic or a potential mentor to a budding writer, and yet this is what I became.","My mother was a great bringer-up of children. My memories are of a sense of security and comfort.","Part of the very impulse of writing for me is actually wanting to get away from myself.","One of the things that probably drew me to writing was that it was something you could get on with by yourself. Publishing means going public. But the actual activity could scarcely be more invisible. And private.","I don't reread my books.","The idea of stopping is not unmeaningful to me. I think there might be a time when, in theory at least, you'd say, 'Well I've mostly done what I want to do.' But how could you ever prevent a few years down the line some germ of an idea getting at you and you've got to do it again?","There's no such thing as the contemporary novel. Before I seem the complete reactionary, let me add that I've happily joined in many discussions about 'the contemporary novel' where what that usually, unproblematically means is novels that have appeared recently or may appear soon.","Today's news, which may be yesterday's anyway, will be eclipsed tomorrow.","There's an undeniable thrill in seeing what's most current in our lives offered back to us in fictional guise, but it soon dates and it's never enough.","The e-book does seem at the moment to threaten the livelihood of writers, because the way in which writers are paid for their work in the form of e-books is very much up in the air.","When anything goes digital, let alone something as immaterial as a book, there is a tendency to see it as just in the air to be taken, and to lose the sense that somebody once made it.","I think the purveyors of e-books are only too happy for this atmosphere of 'everything belongs to everybody' to increase because it means they don't have to think so much about the original maker of the thing, or they can get away with paying them less.","Unfortunately writers take a very small part of the profit on their books, and I think in the e-book world there is a real danger they will take even less, unless they are vigilant and robust about protecting their own interests.","I share my name with an aerobatic bird that can whiz across a whole summer sky in seconds. A swift is so equipped for speed that it can scarcely cope with being stationary.","Novels, in my experience, are slow in coming, and once I've begun them I know I have years rather than months of work ahead of me.","All novelists must form their personal pacts in some way with the slowness of their craft. There are some who demand of themselves a 'rate of production,' for whom it's a matter of pride to complete, say, a book every year.","I do my thinking while I walk. It just loosens up the mind in the way that you don't get when you are sitting at a desk.","There is a certain inescapable attachment. If you are born somewhere and circumstances don't take you away from it, then you grow up and remain within it.","Of course there are times when I hate London, but equally there are times when I can walk 'round a corner and I really feel that this is my place.","I think what I like to do is to begin with the ordinary and find the extraordinary in it.","The novel that's contemporary in the sense of being wholly 'of now' is an impossibility, if only because novels may take years to write, so the 'now' with which they begin will be defunct by the time they're finished.","I tend to begin with what you might call the very small world of personal life. But I am certainly interested in how that small, intimate world connects or doesn't connect with a larger world.","As a novelist, I suppose I can say that I'm highly articulate. But I know, as a person, in other ways, I'm not always articulate. I think we are all, from time to time, inarticulate, at some level, about some things.","When I am writing, I'm very much on the ground, on the same ground my characters are treading.","London is like no other city I know in its ability to become beautiful. You can suddenly turn a corner and there are odd moments - of light, of weather.","I respond to the sound of London being spoken - to the sound of London.","If people read 'Tomorrow' and feel that it is offering them some view of my own household, they would be very, very wrong.","In my work you often get an abrupt shift in time, a jolt. But the emotional logic will take the reader on. I hope. I trust. After all, our memories do not work with any sequential logic.","Structure that really pays off is all based on emotion. I don't write down an elaborate plan. It's really done by feel. It's one area of my writing that I think I've got surer at as I've evolved.","The pen is very quick for getting stuff from your brain to the page. I can do hieroglyphics in the margin. There are days when I really enjoy the flow of ink. I mean, nice pen, ink straight on to the page."],"Graham Taylor":["Football needs its roots, it needs its connection with the supporters. But those in charge seem to think they can do without them.","In football, time and space are the same thing.","It's the only way we can lose, irrespective of the result.","Shearer could be at 100 per cent fitness, but not peak fitness.","To be really happy, we must throw our hearts over the bar and hope that our bodies will follow.","Very few of us have any idea whatsoever of what life is like living in a goldfish bowl, except, of course, for those of us who are goldfish.","In club football you have your players and staff with you all the time, preparing for two games a week, you know them inside out, you have a discipline over them.","In international football you have 10 games a season, with players from different clubs. There's no time for proper coaching; they're just recovering from playing on the Saturday.","I have to choose my words carefully because I don't want to sound like one of those who goes on about how things were better in my day.","You go to Holland, France, Germany, every community, the tiniest village, they have magnificent, pristine sports facilities.","The biggest thing I've found since I left the game - and I'm glad I chose to leave rather than being sacked - is that so many people are in football for the wrong reasons. Not because they love the game, but because they smell money."],"Graham Yost":["I still run into people in the business who skip over any other credits I have and say, 'I loved 'Hey, Dude!' This was back in '88, '89, '90. It was a goofy show about kids working at a dude ranch in Arizona. We did 65 episodes; I wrote 13 of them. We didn't know what we were doing, but it was writers' boot camp. It was great.","If you put people in a corner, you see what their character really is.","I had a great dad and we had a great relationship, but he's still a part of my life.","My first real showbiz job was on a Nickelodeon show called 'Hey, Dude.' That was my first real paid scriptwriting job.","I do believe that we're in a true golden era of television, and I think it started with 'Hill Street.'","Over the course of television's history, I think fans have done more to save shows and support them than ruin them."],"Gram Parsons":["At Harvard, you don't major. You concentrate.","I just passed my identification crisis and came back to country music."],"Grandma Moses":["I look out the window sometimes to seek the color of the shadows and the different greens in the trees, but when I get ready to paint I just close my eyes and imagine a scene.","Life is what we make it, always has been, always will be.","I paint from the top down. From the sky, then the mountains, then the hills, then the houses, then the cattle, and then the people.","Painting's not important. The important thing is keeping busy.","A strange thing is memory, and hope; one looks backward, and the other forward; one is of today, the other of tomorrow. Memory is history recorded in our brain, memory is a painter, it paints pictures of the past and of the day.","If I hadn't started painting, I would have raised chickens.","I look back on my life like a good day's work, it was done and I am satisfied with it.","If you know somethin' well, you can always paint it but people would be better off buyin' chickens.","A primitive artist is an amateur whose work sells."],"Grandmaster Flash":["I want to go to - what's that hot country with a lot of money? - Dubai.","I don't want to be classified as an old-skool DJ or new-skool DJ. I want to be classified as an all-skool DJ who plays it all. I also want to learn to DJ house music in my own fashion.","I'm not big on snacks, but I if do, I like a few M&M's.","All you have to know is mathematically how many times to scratch it and when to let it go - when certain things will enhance the record you're listening to.","Do not let any record company disturb your creative flow. You are not writing for the record company. You're writing for the public.","Conquer your neighbourhood, conquer your city, conquer your country, and then go after the rest of the world. That's my mantra.","Hip Hop has become real constrained. The creative juices and creative flows have been diminished.","As an individual I was known as the DJ or the mixer.","So what I'm trying to say is from a musical aspect for anybody to say that whatever they're doing in Florida is not Hip Hop or whatever they're doing in LA is not Hip Hop, who are these people to say that?","I like fixin' up old cars and doing things with my family.","We can come from our own particular point of view and lay it down. We should not be throwing verbal rocks at each other. We're all responsible to continue the growth of Hip Hop.","But I had two very special people who helped to take my style to the next level. Thank God for my first MC Cowboy and my first student Grand Wizard Theodore, and to go out after creating this art form and finding everyone jamming to it - that too was pretty scary.","Disco B still rolls with me now. He's still doing his thing. He does clubs in different places. He was very instrumental in helping me perfect my craft.","For anybody to say well this is not Hip Hop and that's not Hip Hop, that is not the way the formula was laid down. It was for the people who were going to continue take anything musically and string it along.","For instance, if you're playing a record with drums - horns would sound nice to enhance it so you get a record with horns and slip it in at certain times.","For us to keep claiming this isn't Hip Hop and that isn't Hip Hop doesn't make sense to me.","I had to go into a studio and compose and write and press up 12 songs in 14 hours. When you're recording a song from scratch it takes you 14 hours to do just one song.","I think what's happening here is, there's a group or maybe one person who is saying this is gonna be the definition and this is what we want to get the kids to do now.","Normal kids in their teens want to go and date girls and do mischievous things, your hormones are jumping around, but I stayed in my bedroom in search of something.","The type of mixing that was out then was blending from one record to the next or waiting for the record to go off and wait for the jock to put the needle back on.","We can even sing off key, but if it's produced properly it can be a hit.","We gotta stop fighting amongst each other. I think the only rift should be when take it the stage and try to out perform each other.","What has happened is that to some degree they have taken an attitude where they don't listen to demos of diverse subject matters. They're looking for demos like the record the guy on the left just did.","Disco was brand new then and there were a few jocks that had monstrous sound systems but they wouldn't dare play this kind of music. They would never play a record where only two minutes of the song was all it was worth. They wouldn't buy those types of records.","I had love for Breakout; I had love for Bambaataa. I had love for Kool Herc.","Before this DJ thing, I was hopelessly taking things apart to try to figure out how they worked. I'd go mess around with burned-out cars, with my mom's stereo - I was public enemy #1 in my house for that. So my mom noticed that I was interested in this and decided to send me to school so I'd know what I was doing.","I knew there was a way to blend records together, but I didn't know how to. This was haunting me when I was in my teens. In my frustration, I decided to start experimenting with electronics. I tested the torque factor on different turntables. I had to figure needles out. See, there are two kinds, elliptical and conical.","I developed the Clock Theory to help me time records; you know, spin the record back two revolutions or whatever and then play the break, spin the other one back two, play, like that.","Hmmmm... It's fun being in front of people, playing shows and all. But hotels? Being away from home? That's different.","I needed a way to have the platter continuously spinning while I'm moving the record back and forth. I went to a fabric store. When I touched this hairy stuff - felt - I found it. I rubbed spray starch on both sides and ironed it until it became a stiff wafer. After that, I was able to stop time.","I went to junkyards, abandoned car lots. I asked supermarkets for the big jugs they put pig guts in, to make cabinets for my bass speakers.","I was a quiet, nerdy kid living in the Bronx. I spent most of my teens in my room, taking apart electrical items to figure out how they worked before putting them back together, and listening to the music my four older sisters and parents played.","I named myself Flash many years ago, as I loved the cartoon. Then my own fans said that I should call myself 'Grandmaster,' because of the way I operate turntables. I put the two together and that was it.","If there is a record I don't have, I haven't heard it yet. My collection is always growing, but I can't really play it anywhere - no promoter is willing to pay for my crates of vinyl to fly with me, so I have a team of people to digitise it all.","When I am performing live, I walk into a room, and I just try to get a feel for the vibe, and I am coming from different angles musically. I might come with a new song, I might come with some hip-hop, with some R&B. Once I find my way, then I am hitting you, and hitting you all night.","My father was my first inspiration. He had an incredible stereo and a turntable, and I was told not to touch it. But I'd go back and touch it anyway. I gained a respect for the turntables when I was a kid. When I was a teenager, I came up with a 'cueing system' to work the turntables because they didn't have it at that time."],"Granit Xhaka":["I don't mind being criticised, because I am not that easy to knock down, and no-one can destroy me. But I am bothered by the stupid people who call me dirty, brainless, and an idiot. You don't say words like these to someone who you know nothing about.","The expectations are high, so we know: If we do not meet them, there is criticism. We have high expectations ourselves. We are not happy with fourth, third, or second, either.","Actually, it's normal when you come to a new club and country: you need to get used to the language, the philosophy of the team, the squad, the coach.","My brother was always going to go in the direction of football. With me, it was more between school and football. Eventually, it worked out for both of us. We're pleased to have gone down that path. I'm proud that my parents always supported us, in good and in bad times. You need that.","When I was younger, even though I had a big brother, my parents would give me the house key every day.","I am a very simple man. I love normality, and I love normal people. I love to eat normal food. It's how I grew up.","I think, when a manager has been at a club for more than 20 years, he can only have a positive impact.","I like to play football. I'm an aggressive player and also a leader.","Every Monday, we're asked to undertake jump tests to check the conditions of our muscles. There's nothing you can hide. Once a week, they do urine tests, and your body fat percentage is tested regularly. The doctors cover all bases.","Family is the most important thing to me. Especially my brother Taulant - we talk about everything together.","I'm a person who thinks realistically but has dreams and fantasies as well.","In football, you get criticised if you are sent off. It's my style of play, and nobody can make me change that. Even if I get another red card, then that happens. You become cleverer, maybe look more, and since my red card, I think things have improved.","It could be very costly if you don't have a clear mind during a tournament.","Arsenal is Arsenal. It's not a small club; it's a very big club, and it's like a family. It's very good for me because I love my family, and to have another family here is very good.","Ottmar is a big coach and a good gentleman. I don't know if I'm a young Schweinsteiger; I'm another player. I am Granit Xhaka.","Arsenal were really interested in me for a long time, and I think that I fit into the football Arsenal play.","There a lot of occasions when Albanians cause trouble, but then we are also very nice people. People sometimes forget that there are good people from the Balkans as well.","I have learned one thing in my life: If I put too much pressure on myself, then everything goes wrong.","When I went to Gladbach from Basel in 2012, I put a lot of pressure on myself at first, and it was too heavy. I will not put any pressure on myself at Arsenal, even though the transfer fee was high.","The fans are amazing. I'm really happy here at Arsenal, and I'm going to do my best for this club.","London is really nice, and I'm really happy here, but, of course, I've moved here to play football and not just to be in the city.","In games, you notice there's more sprints than in Bundesliga. It takes a while to get used to.","I think every new player needs time when they come to a new club and a new country, and I certainly did.","Maybe if I was born in Kosovo, I might not be where I am now, so I need to thank Switzerland, of course, because I went to school there, learnt to play football there, and started my career there.","Moving to England, again it's a new language to learn, and I've got to get use to the mentality, the culture, but I think I've integrated myself really well into this team, and I'm happy so far.","The Premier League is not my goal but a childhood dream. It is a dream that could be fulfilled.","I know that there are coaches in the Bundesliga that have said in team meetings, 'Provoke Xhaka; he will eventually go ballistic.' I think that is sad. That, in my view, has nothing to do with football.","No, Borussia is not falling apart. It does not matter whichever players will leave. That is what the past has showed. The club has developed and actually improved despite big-name players leaving.","To have six years of professional football under my belt already is really something.","I know I've made mistakes, and sometimes I've talked about things too openly or directly. That wasn't good, and I've learned from that.","I compliment Kramer perfectly. We both put in a lot of legwork, win many balls, and we're comfortable with the ball at our feet. We also talk a lot both off and on the pitch.","I have never had any contact with Bayern Munich, let alone have agreed personal terms.","You can't afford to rest on your laurels at all, or you'll instantly be on the bench.","I knew before I arrived that the pressure at a club that challenges for the title grows quickly. The season is long; we'll become stronger with every game.","What happens here, the daily agenda of Arsenal, is very different from what I experienced in Monchengladbach.","My game is about being aggressive, and I'm not the same player if you take that away from me.","I never hesitate to go into a tackle, and I don't go onto the pitch to pull out of a challenge.","I remember I was young, and the first game I watched was in the Premier League. It's a big dream for me, and now that I'm here, I am very, very happy.","It's aggressive, and I like the way Arsenal play football. It's not like other countries, but it's very, very nice here.","It's difficult to say no when Manchester City want you and you could play there. That much I have to admit.","In the past, we showed that we could play football, but Vladimir Petkovic has worked with us on the psychological side of things in particular. I think that's where we've made the most progress. He's brought us closer together as a team.","If you win, you're heroes. But if you don't, then you're losers. That might sound harsh, but that's the way it is.","People who know me know that I don't talk about the play-offs. It's not an issue for me at all.","Everyone fights for everyone else. If someone has a bad day, then the others are there for him. And if a player makes a mistake, then the others can compensate for that. Those sorts of things are crucial at this level, and it's really important that we perform as a unit.","It's in my head that I am a leader, and captaining Monchengladbach was very good for me.","I'm going to give my best and not worry about transfer fees or anything like that.","I'll give my all on the pitch, as I have in recent years. That's what is important. We will give our all to win something.","I'm looking forward to the new adventure. Playing in the Premier League was always my dream, and I'm definitely going to relish this opportunity and give my absolute everything for this club.","Arsenal play attractive football, and I enjoy that. I think you could see against the MLS side that this team has a lot of quality, and we'll give our all to show that on the pitch.","The first few months in a new country are always really hard.","I still want to improve in every way. I'm a young player. I want to work, and that's my aim: to improve in every single aspect of my play.","A club like Arsenal, it's normal that expectations are high. This club must compete for titles, and that's what we want to do.","He's not a coach who speaks to you every day. Wenger has spoken to me two or three times. He's told me he's very impressed by how I train and how I'm a disciplined character.","You can see the players are world-class just by the way they pass the ball. Ozil, Sanchez, and Cazorla, for example, are huge personalities. Even though the club maybe spent more money on me, I can still learn a lot from them in any respect.","Arsenal prepare the players in the best way. They pay attention to every detail. We are able to recover optimally during our flights. The food and the service, everything's geared perfectly to each other.","In Germany, you can play aggressively, but the referee will always blow his whistle, but in England, that's not the case. That's better for me.","My dad played football, too, in the former Yugoslavia.","One of the most revealing details about my parents is that they only got together three months before my dad's arrest.","Personally, I can handle criticism, especially when it is deserved, and it's because my dad never, ever said 'Well done' to me. He did it on purpose so that I kept my feet on the ground.","In Camden, it's just the atmosphere that gets me. It's simple. It's nice. It's real. And it's the people, too. I like to interact with them because they are normal and I am normal. People probably don't expect an Arsenal player to come to Camden Lock and, basically, be a normal guy.","We always have hope. Hope dies last.","It's not like I played my first football match in England. For me, football is pretty much the same everywhere; the ball is round, but maybe tactically, things are different than at other clubs I've played for.","I think in football everything is possible.","You always need a certain amount of time to fully adjust; it was no different when I moved to the Bundesliga.","I'm a hard-working young man who believes in myself.","I never used to be taken seriously as a Swiss person.","I will give everything to help Arsenal win trophies and make the fans happy.","It's true that my father was imprisoned for three and a half years, and it was because he stood up for what he believed in. It's not a taboo subject in our household. We talk about it. After all, I want to know what happened.","I can't stand people who are backward. I am honest, straightforward. I don't like to pretend. And I will not change either.","I have a good relationship with the Albanian fans. But when you are called a traitor - that is such a harsh word. Most of the Albanian fans respect me. But 'traitor' is unacceptable considering the background of my family.","Individual quality doesn't decide games for us but the whole team.","Lots of people talk about the character of our team, that it's not right and that we need to do more. But we always show that we can come back.","I am in an outstanding city, an outstanding club. The only thing that Arsenal has been missing is a league title.","I don't think Gladbach are on the same level as Arsenal.","I am still young; I am still fresh, and I want more.","I am a regular for one of the biggest clubs in Europe, and I want to progress still further.","When I think about a mid-table club like Everton spending £150 million during the summer, I am lost for words.","I guess I'd say I'm quite an aggressive player. Fair but aggressive, someone who likes the tough stuff."],"Grant Achatz":["There are about 700 flavors that you can smell, but only five you can taste. A lot of times what you're perceiving as flavor has nothing to do with palette, but it's more to do with scents.","Ultimately, the perfect meal is when those things come together - circumstance, the food, ambiance, and you're with the person that you want to be with.","My life has been such a blur since I was 18, 19 years old. I haven't even had time to contemplate my own life. By forcing yourself to write your life story you learn a great deal about yourself.","I always knew I wanted to be a chef.","Food is a necessary component to life. People can live without Renoir, Mozart, Gaudi, Beckett, but they cannot live without food.","Part of becoming a little bit older and having the opportunities that I have, you want to start giving back to people who have been influential and helped you along the way.","Food can be expressive and therefore food can be art.","The most luxurious thing to me is having an hour of my day, which rarely happens, to listen to my iPod and sit on my couch. That's how I unwind.","To me, every kitchen appliance is useful and nothing's overrated. When I look at my little espresso machine, I don't see coffee. I see a steaming valve as an opportunity to make amazing creme brulee.","My personality was always such that I always look straight forward, never behind or to the side.","It's not really the life of cooking that's hard - it's what you make of it and what level you push yourself to.","I don't care if you're doing haute cuisine or burgers and pizza, just do it right.","What makes the food that we do at Alinea so interesting on the outside is that we really don't let ourselves say no to an idea.","Here's the irony in what I do: When I go out to eat, I like classic French food. I like amazing Japanese food that has such a history that it goes back hundreds of years. And I also like really innovative food as well.","Anything that could ever prevent me from achieving a goal, I put in a box, tape it up, throw it over my shoulder. You aim for a goal and attain it. Then you look to the next one.","Most smoked salts are made with liquid smoke, which is a condensate, but really, really good smoked salt is literally smoked.","In a lot of ways, a lot of smells that aren't necessarily edible smell good, and they remind you of certain aspects of food. So making those associations with what smells good or smells a certain way and pairing that with actual edible ingredients is one avenue that we take creatively.","I lived my whole life in the kitchen. Not only that, but it's the passion, it's the love for cooking and food. It's dictated my entire life - every aspect of it.","Alinea is not the type of restaurant where you go if you're in a hurry. Really, it's about enjoying that three-hour block of time and reflecting on the food, having great conversation with your dining companion.","My home kitchen is airy, with a gas stove, a stainless-steel island table in the center and granite countertops. It's very modest but there's tons of counter space, so you can slap down three or four cutting boards.","The popularity of the Internet and using it as an available resource has really changed the way chefs kind of gather information and look for inspiration. To me, a food trend is potentially a lot of people following an idea.","I wish that food trucks could exist here in Chicago like they do in Brooklyn and in New York, where you're actually cooking off the truck.","Growing up as a young kid, I was in a restaurant. So, you know, I always had a very good understanding of the nuances. And in a way, that was a bad thing. Because it kind of programmed me to believe that if you're going have a restaurant, this is what you need to do, and this is the way it's going to be run.","I hate stuff in my pockets, can't stand it. I'll carry stuff in my hands rather than put it in my pockets.","Whenever people are faced with any sort of adversity... they tend to gravitate toward things that make them comfortable, and things that they feel are important.","Whatever it is you're doing, whether it's your career or a particular focus, if you're trying to be the best you can possibly be, then you'll be putting that pressure on yourself.","We all eat two to six times a day. Why? Because we are supposed to, we are programmed to, we want to.","A cookbook is not like being an author. It's writing down recipes; it's not writing.","I was a completely below-average high school student. I never went to college.","I had D minuses in chemistry and all of the sciences, and now I'm known as a molecular gastronomist.","If I had one piece of advice for people - if they are cooking from the Alinea cookbook, the Betty Crocker cookbook or the back of the box - read through the entire recipe first before reaching for any ingredients, and then read again and execute the directions."],"Grant Bowler":["Making a movie with Lindsay Lohan is not for the faint of heart.","I never talk about a job before the contract is signed and I've shot the first three days.","Money is tighter now, with the advertising dollar spread a lot more thinly across a whole range of media because of the Internet. It means the television networks have less power to produce shows, and TV is where most Australian actors make their money.","I grew up in Queensland, and my dad was a tradesman and my mum an insurance agent, both self-employed.","A long-running TV series is a beast in that it demands you stick to one character over a long haul.","Comedy has to be so much cleaner than drama. You can't layer it in the way you can a dramatic performance. Which is why it's more difficult than drama - you don't have so many tricks.","I don't watch the beginnings of many series; I don't know why - maybe because I'm normally working.","I love working in New Zealand. It's just the most beautiful country I've ever been to.","I was born in New Zealand, so I have a lot of family there.","I think that the way of bringing realism into fantasy is to treat it as the commonplace.","A character, their ability or inability to laugh at themselves should always be a very, very conscious choice. It's a very big key to the nature of a human being.","I love playing bad guys; they're always much more fun than the good guy.","I seem to be incapable of playing that guy that always does the right thing, who always responds well in any circumstance.","For my money, if I'm playing anything then it has to have some sharp angles on it. It's got to have some edges that you can cut yourself on, otherwise it's boring.","I'm a huge fan of classic sci-fi.","I've actually usually been wary of taking on science fiction as an actor because it's really tough to do. It's really difficult to execute. There's often lots of prosthetics, green screen and special effects, and it can get very technical."],"Grant Gustin":["I've never been passionate about just music, I've never seen myself going into music in that sense. My love for music has always been connected to the stories told through music, which is why I was drawn to theater and why I think 'Glee' is so powerful.","My childhood dream was always to be on Broadway. I wanted to end up in TV and film. It's kind of flipped, and I'm not mad about it, but my childhood dream is Broadway and I want to end up there.","My favorite actor that I look up to is Joseph Gordon-Levitt. His career is something I look up to, I just want to be that guy. He's always part of projects that have a lot of soul and that's what I want to do as an actor.","Some of my favorite artists are Jason Mraz, Eric Hutchinson, Ben Folds, Bruno Mars, Mumford and Sons, Maroon 5 - their vibe is slightly different from all the pop stuff on 'Glee,' although some do fall into that genre.","'Glee' found me. I didn't really go looking for it.","I was 'gay-bashed' when I was in school even though, you know, I'm not... I'm a straight guy that just happens to be what I do. So, it's easily relatable to me. It was awful. It's a hard time in a kid's life."],"Grant Heslov":["A film like 'Good Night And Good Luck,' you make that for $7 million because you know it's a black-and-white film, and it's not an easy sell. If you make it for $7 million, then everybody can have a chance to make a little bit of money, and you get to make the film you want to make.","When you look at a film like 'The Ides of March' or 'Good Night, and Good Luck' even, those are really contained pictures.","I acted for so many years and sat on a million sets and worked with a million different directors so that is to me some of the best training you can get.","Look, a lot of directors were actors, even if they were unsuccessful actors which I think is helpful. I think it's a really helpful thing for a director to have experienced that. It helps you know how to talk to actors and how to get what you need from them.","What you learn when you direct a film, even more so than as a producer, it's a marriage. It's like a relationship with that film so you've got to make sure that it's really something that you want to live with for three years or however long it is. So I haven't found the right thing to marry yet.","There are times when you work with directors on set, and things are a bit rudderless, and those can be good directors.","There are films that cost a lot of money that might be decent films. But if they don't perform in that first weekend or two, they're gone.","It takes a long time to get a film made.","You have to make films you feel strongly about. And then hope you can find the audience.","Actors know how to talk to other actors in a way that sometimes other directors just don't.","'The Ides of March' was a fairly cynical film.","'Monuments Men' is not a docudrama. It's not a documentary.","'Monuments Men' is a movie... I don't want to say for grown-ups, because some young folks could appreciate it, too. But if you're expecting 'Transformers,' you're going to be disappointed.","I find writing really difficult - definitely the most difficult of all the things I do.","I didn't want to be 50 or 60 and auditioning for a three-line role.","I'm very superstitious.","Writing a screenplay is like writing a big puzzle, and so the hardest part, I think, is getting the story.","Generally, screenplays suck.","You work with great directors and terrible directors, and so you learn; you take what you think will work for you.","I think it's more interesting to throw people into a story and let them catch up instead of explaining and feeling like you have to slow down for them. I think audiences, for the most part, they don't want to be ahead of you.","When I write, I make decent money doing it, but I don't wake up dreaming about writing.","Creatively, it's great, because when you write your own movies, you get to create whatever you want.","I don't make my living writing; I make my living as a producer and as a director."],"Grant Hill":["My teammates at Duke - all of them, black and white - were a band of brothers who came together to play at the highest level for the best coach in basketball.","Regardless of the obstacles or hurdles that are ahead of you, regardless of the opponent, regardless of the odds, your goal and objective always is to win. I think that's part of sports.","I want to do the best I can and let everyone else worry about legacies.","I've done a lot of basketball drills, not a whole lot of competitive stuff. I have basically been in the gym everyday working on my game, working on the time off that I've had from the game, just getting myself prepared mentally and physically for the season.","People don't realize the amount of stress you put on your body both physically and mentally from just the wear and tear of a season.","I had a MRSA infection on my ankle. At the time, I had never heard of MRSA. I didn't really know a whole lot about it. It really scared me.","I was on the board at my children's school in Phoenix: I was Mr. Daddy Daycare.","The great thing about sports is you constantly have to prove yourself. You constantly have to go out there and do it, day in and day out.","Every year you suit up, you play for a championship. Some years, some teams... it was very few times I think I played on that realistically had a chance.","Obviously, drafts sometimes are good ones, or bad ones; I think you can get a good, quality player late in the lottery.","My favorite memory is, as a freshman, going to Carolina and beating them. Going over there and winning on their court. I think that was the only time I did win on their court.","I had the opportunity at Duke to start doing things in the community, and it's something I continue to do even 20 years later.","There's a wealth of information and knowledge you can gain from sitting down with people who are successful.","I tried to make a point of doing things outside the box, of not having basketball consume me.","I was keenly aware when I was drafted, when I signed my first contract; immediately, I was thinking about the end.","I know most of the black players who preceded and followed me at Duke. They all contribute to our tradition of excellence on the court.","I am proud of my family. I am proud of my Duke championships and all my Duke teammates. And, I am proud I never lost a game against the Fab Five.","It's not easy for a freshman, especially not at Duke.","I think the world of Dave Griffin. I worked with him in Phoenix, got to know him very well, and consider him a friend.","I like to think of myself as a pretty good athlete, I don't think I'm a great sprinter, but 200, 400, maybe 800. I won't say excel in them, but I'd do pretty good.","It wasn't popular for college athletics to embrace Title IX.","The accomplishments in college and even in the pros are more in my mind because you constantly see Duke on TV during basketball season. You constantly see the NBA."],"Grant Morrison":["Burnout is grist to the mill. I write every day, for most of the day, so it's just about turning into metaphor whatever's going on in my life, in the world, and in my head. Every nightmare, every moment of grief or joy or failure, is a moment I can convert into cash via words.","It's hard for me to believe that a shy, bespectacled college graduate like Brad Meltzer who's a novelist and a father is a really setting out to be weirdly misogynistic.","I was a clubber in the Nineties. I went dancing every week.","I think any writer coming on to 'Batman' should at least attempt to do their own definitive version. What it means to them. Whatever they think that symbol or character can say.","I tend to only read comics written by friends or people I've known. And I'm not a great comic reader.","The only time I ever met a character that I wrote was when I met Ian McKellan, when he was playing Magneto in the 'X-Men' movies.","The thing that's been exciting about 'Superman' is to see how the character has developed through generations.","I love 'Batman.' I love the Adam West 'Batman.' I love the animated 'Batman.' The character of Batman can encompass any interpretation, which is what makes that character so brilliant and why it's survived so many different media.","I don't like to think of my readership as 'fans,' a word which has always suggested a kind of power relationship I'm uncomfortable with.","There are dozens of unfinished or aborted projects in my files, but I can only assume they don't get done because they're not robust enough to struggle through the birth process.","I'm lucky to have a job doing something I really love to do, and I'm happy to accept the pressures of relentless deadlines or reader expectations as necessary evils. It's probably not as stressful as mining coal or leading men into battle.","I was always interested in myths growing up. So, first I got into some Roman myths, then I was interested in Norse, then Celtic, then I started spreading to all the other mythologies.","Consciousness, rather than being something that we have, is something we participate in.","I guess my inspiration is this - I like to pretend that every story that ever happened to 'Batman' was real and is part of this one guy's life.","Unlike novel characters, comic book characters last an eternity. When a character is changed beyond recognition, there's no longer the merchandising aspect.","Write comic books if you love comic books so much that you want to write them. Don't write them like movies. Comics can do a lot of things that movies can't do, and vice versa."],"Grant Show":["At home, we live on the beach, and it's like every day is a date.","Marc Cherry is so good at writing himself into a corner, then writing himself out of that corner. It's really fun to watch that.","I think that there were only two people in my high school that were comfortable there, and I think they are both pumping gas now.","I like to joke that I already married a 26-year-old and divorced a 29-year-old, so I wasn't going to do that again when I got remarried.","If you want to be with someone who is 15 or 20 years younger, that's fine, but I've found that if you haven't been knocked down a little bit, then you're probably not going to be hanging with me too much.","You do need to maintain some of yourself and know who you are, but that doesn't mean you can't evolve.","I grew up in Northern California, so the hippies were still around. My father and mother were very Republican, very strait-laced and very uptight, but my uncles were hippies.","I remember the very first suit I bought. It was a three-piece denim suit with bell-bottoms.","I've been acting professionally since I was 24, and it's the only job I've ever done.","A few years after 'Melrose Place,' when the luster of 'Melrose Place' wore off and what was left was just the stink, and I was just doing bad TV movies, that was a personal low point. I felt I needed to stop doing those, and I did.","I went to Samuel Ayer High School, which is now Milpitas High School.","I absolutely hated high school. As a freshman, I was 5 feet tall and weighed 95 pounds... When I got to high school, I had no social skills. Was I a nerd? More of a dork. Definitely not one of the popular kids.","On some level, I think everyone felt like a dork in high school."],"Grant Tinker":["I assume you know what to do with this. That's why you were hired.","First be best, then be first."],"Grant Wood":["All the good ideas I ever had came to me while I was milking a cow.","You can do anything with beer that you can do with wine. Beer is great for basting or marinating meat and fish."],"Grant-Lee Phillips":["Collaboration is much like a birth. The song that springs forth resembles each one of us to a degree, but it's the kind of thing that would never be born from just one of us sitting down with a guitar.","I've made a few albums in such an autonomous way; it often has been exhausting. It's almost difficult to enjoy the process when you take on so much.","I think a lot of songwriters would agree that it's often easier to find inspiration in misery.","There's nothing more painful than something that's superficially upbeat but you can kind of tell behind it that there's a cynicism, or even a bitterness.","I'm always keen to head to where the greatest gravitation pull is tugging me.","I played with the same band for years and years and there's a beauty to having one solid core that you keep exploring. On the other hand, it's nice to throw yourself in different situations where you find out things about your own resources.","Being an actor is a much more structured life than being a musician.","I don't know how other bands play the same songs every night.","I don't like knowing what the next song is because that's what I'd think about during the number we're playing."],"Grantland Rice":["A wise man makes his own decisions, an ignorant man follows the public opinion.","All wars are planned by old men in council rooms apart.","Depend upon yourself. Make your judgement trustworthy by trusting it. You can develop good judgement as you do the muscles of your body - by judicious, daily exercise. To be known as a man of sound judgement will be much in your favor.","Does the road wind up-hill all the way? Yes, to the very end. Will the day's journey take the whole long day? From morn to night, my friend.","There's no dearth of kindness in this world of ours; Only in our blindness we gather thorns for flowers.","Few learn golf in a lifetime.","You are meant to play the ball as it lies, a fact that may help to touch on your own objective approach to life.","Eighteen holes of match play will teach you more about your foe than 18 years of dealing with him across a desk."],"Gray Davis":["There is only one governor, and his name is Gray Davis.","Well, there's no question that the law passed in 1996 was flawed. It deregulated the wholesale market, meaning the price that the utilities had to pay energy companies for power, but not the retail market.","So it was flawed in that it didn't require California to have a first claim on the power plants. It deregulated part of the market, but not all of the market.","We started focusing on this in earnest late summer and early fall. I can build more power plants. In the 12 years before us, not a single plant of major consequence was built.","I don't know why they're doing it. I have to assume that their motives are positive, not negative. But they don't understand the severity of the problem in this state.","They're the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and they will not do that. They will not pull the trigger.","Why? Because we're very well down this process as it is - flawed as it is - and we're counting on getting more power plants on line by the end of 2003 so we have a surplus of power.","I don't know if I would do this if I had to start over again.","I'm doing my part, building plants at a record rate, having historic conservation levels. The only people not doing their part is the federal government that is siding with the energy companies against the interests of the people of California.","As the governor of this state, I obviously see the issue quite differently.","Duke came to us. They volunteered to come to us and made a number of suggestions to some people on my staff. I don't know how I would characterize them, but there have been some discussions going back and forth between Duke and members of my staff.","I know that Duke made a number of demands, including that the attorney general drop its investigation. We have no intention of asking the attorney general to do that.","Here is my general approach to the energy companies. You have already charged the utilities a 50 percent credit penalty for the power they were buying from you. You're charging us a penalty. You're not going to get two bites of the apple here.","I have not been briefed.","We're not going to take this sitting down. We are fighting back.","We're going to march on Washington with a host of Republicans, Democrats, business leaders, legislators.","There are so many scenarios here. We tried to prepare for the worst summer in 40 years and build assumptions based on that. We're preparing for the worst, but we're hoping for the best. And I've told people the end is in sight.","Well, we're trying to patch and fix and put a cast on a broken system here. You can call it what you want, but we'll continue to purchase power in a private market.","We'll have a public power authority, which will also have the ability to build power or finance power. And more importantly, we'll have more power than our economy provides. All of that will give us leverage we don't have today.","Meanwhile, people have to join us and fight back against the federal government that has dropped the ball, that is in bed with these energy companies, that wants them to make more money than they've made before.","We believe you will not have to pay more than the current rate structure proposes - which is, for 50 percent of the public, nothing; for another 25 percent, only a 10 percent increase; and for the remaining 25 percent, a 34 percent increase.","There's no question that California, in the last three or four years, has been privileged to add disproportionately to the economic growth of America, and to contribute to its technological productivity.","Now, in the space of a year, we've spent 450 percent more for power than we did the year before, and bought essentially the same amount of power. This year, that number's likely to go up. That can't go on forever and have us continue to be the economic engine for America."],"Gray Scott":["Robots will harvest, cook, and serve our food. They will work in our factories, drive our cars, and walk our dogs. Like it or not, the age of work is coming to an end.","We're going to become caretakers for the robots. That's what the next generation of work is going to be.","There is no reason and no way that a human mind can keep up with an artificial intelligence machine by 2035.","In 'Chappie,' you see this sort of young robot that's learning through maybe 'deep learning' how to see the world really, look out into the world, and learn step by step. What's so interesting is that with 'Chappie,' you're getting to see how human behavior reacts to artificial intelligence, and I don't think it's always going to be positive.","Watch a child play, and you will see real power. They are fearless.","To understand the future of technology, we need to begin with one fundamental truth: Technology is natural.","By 2018, automation is going to be in full swing in the United States and around the world. There are estimates that it could replace 50 percent of our jobs. That is an enormous shift. But even if we go through a phase where we have an unemployment valley from automation, there will be new jobs and new things for us to do.","The real question is, when will we draft an artificial intelligence bill of rights? What will that consist of? And who will get to decide that?","Immortality may be impossible, but imagine what humanity could learn if we all lived 700 years. We could travel deep into utopia and beyond.","Who gets to decide the robotic bill of rights? It's going to be controversial.","The 'Star Trek' future, to me, is where we are headed. Everything is automated, and we are free to pursue our dreams. We are free to pursue lives that aren't about working and toiling away in dangerous jobs. For example, how many of us would love to be poets, or how many of us would love to be artists?","You have to talk about 'The Terminator' if you're talking about artificial intelligence. I actually think that that's way off. I don't think that an artificially intelligent system that has superhuman intelligence will be violent. I do think that it will disrupt our culture.","These machines are going to reflect our species and our evolutionary process. Everything we are will end up in these artificially intelligent machines no matter what we do.","I don't think that an artificially intelligent system that has superhuman intelligence will be violent. I do think that it will disrupt our culture.","We are increasingly becoming cyborg-like beings. We are becoming literally what we create. Biology, physics, and technology are evolving towards one and the same thing.","The mobile revolution has dramatically changed our world view, empowered women, and increased our empathy. Corrupt governments have been toppled and wars avoided because our species has become so digitally connected.","Negative and pessimistic views of technology have always existed. I can just imagine some pessimistic Sumerian in 3500 B.C. screaming about the evils of the wheel.","We are afraid of ourselves and our own unconscious minds. When we are building something that reflects us, it's the one thing we're all afraid to face. We're afraid to face ourselves. Building machines that mirror our consciousness is a very frightening proposition because we have seen how evil people can be.","We are going to have to have different ethics for different artificially intelligent machines. You obviously want a different set of ethics for a military artificially intelligent machine or robot than you have for a care-taking robot.","The main thing I'm concerned with right now, is getting people to understand that the Internet of Things is already in their lives. So if you look around your house, either your television, refrigerator, or some of your appliances - they are probably already connected.","We do know that we can set certain algorithms for machines to do certain things - now that may be a simple task. A factory robot that moves one object from here to there. That's a very simple top-down solution. But when we start creating machines that learn for themselves, that is a whole new area that we've never been in before.","Technology will mirror the culture and the psychology creating it. We need new psychological scaffolding to work with. Less fear and more optimism.","It's a physical thing that can grab a hold of data and literally rearrange our lives by changing the direction you take your car in. This continuum is going to keep building on itself as we move forward into the future."],"Graydon Carter":["Life is all about seating and lighting.","I don't do any research. It's all about gut. Editing - it's always about gut.","We admire elephants in part because they demonstrate what we consider the finest human traits: empathy, self-awareness, and social intelligence. But the way we treat them puts on display the very worst of human behavior.","History is nothing if not an epic tale of missed opportunities.","I have always thought you could take the measure of a man by his sports manners - that is to say, the way in which he conducts himself on the playing field, or even over a game of chess or cards.","Arrogance, ignorance, and incompetence. Not a pretty cocktail of personality traits in the best of situations. No sirree. Not a pretty cocktail in an office-mate and not a pretty cocktail in a head of state. In fact, in a leader, it's a lethal cocktail.","Many men think they're playboys, but they invariably land wide of the mark. Surrounding yourself with champagne, fast friends, and paid escorts is the very definition of the word 'loser.'","There are similarities between being an editor and a tailor. Tailors have a vast supply of fabrics, buttons and thread at their disposal and put it together to make a whole. That's what an editor does - looks at society at a given time and pulls together the interesting aspects into a single issue each month.","It's a rare moment when we take a break from the tribulations of the daily rat race to reflect on assumptions and values that we casually accept as gospel.","Every man in the back of their minds would like to own a bar or a racehorse.","As any editor will tell you, startling newsroom revelations are generally met with queries about where the information came from and how the reporter got it. Seriously startling revelations are followed by the vetting of libel lawyers.","In America, the top 1 percent led the country into war and economic devastation, leaving the less fortunate to fight for one and pay for both.","Fashion is a dangerous road to go down. Anybody who is going to have children later in life had best not be too fashionable because the photos will come back to haunt them.","Most of us have learned the hard way that there are very few things you can absolutely count on in life.","New York has arguably become the quintessential 1 percent city, a city that has been so given over to the rich that you now have to be rich to live here. Or not live here: New York's also a preferred destination for foreign money spent on vast, lifeless apartments in the sky that are occupied a couple of weeks a year at most.","Television has the obvious benefits of regularity and intimacy.","Many of the architects of the Vietnam War became near pariahs as they spent the remainder of their lives in the futile quest to explain away their decisions at the time.","In 2004, I wrote 'What We've Lost,' a book about the Bush administration. It sold only reasonably well, in part, I think, because the book was a horrific downer, an unrelenting account of the administration's actions, bungles, deceptions, half-truths, untruths, and downright corruptions.","Satire works best when it hews close to the line between the outlandish and the possible - and as that line continues to grow thinner, the satirist's task becomes ever more difficult.","War is a form of really bad manners, in a strange way. Invading a country I think is just the worst possible manners. 'You're not invited!' Gate crashing on a large scale!","Only institutions that go about the old-fashioned business of taking in deposits from customer A and lending them out to customer B should be called banks. The rest should call themselves what they are. 'Parlors' would be appropriate, or 'dens' - words more suitable to venerable betting pursuits.","Magazines at some point become hostage to their own success.","It could fairly be said that America, during the Bush years, has entered an Age of Denial - arguably the first stage of a nation's decline.","I might wear a dinner jacket once a year to our Oscar party - that's a big thing - but I don't go to parties. I'm social but I'm not a socialite person.","The greatest thing that prepared me for editing 'Vanity Fair' was having four kids because you just learn to subjugate your ego with the greater interest in mind.","I think Americans, more so than any other culture, love second and third acts.","The shelf life of a movie actor or actress is so short, it's like milk.","I think being Canadian helps you as a journalist in America, because you're sort of on the outside watching this big party going on, and you're sort of taking mental notes as it goes on. I think if you're in the party the whole time, you don't notice it as much. And I think Canadians are very good observers of American culture.","You lose manufacturing jobs, you rarely ever get them back again.","We really care about photography at 'Vanity Fair.'","I really don't despise anyone. But there is a list of a half dozen people I would prefer never to hear from or see again.","I'm losing my hair. I'm overweight. It's not like that's at the top of the list when women go looking for a man. It's like - complete collapse, every year.","People think they have to be ambitious. But at a certain age, all you want is to be around nice, decent people.","There's probably a half-dozen movie actors I really like. But a lot of them just aren't that interesting.","Cod is more responsible for the discovery of the New World than almost anything else. Drove the Vikings across the North Atlantic, and John Cabot discovered America by looking for cod.","I did a bunch of blue-collar jobs, because I knew I'd wind up with a white-collar job at some point, and I wanted to, I don't know, I just wanted to taste life. I dug graves for a while, I worked as a stock boy in a big department store, I worked in a bank.","Moping is an unattractive attribute in a man.","I think the movie business is in trouble. It's all movies that you've seen before. Everything's a remake; they want things that are familiar rather than things that surprise you.","You know, I used to warm the thermometer on the light bulb... I was really good at being sick. I could forge my mother's signature on a sick note so well I was hardly ever at school.","The fact is, unlike a lot of writers, I credit the people who help me. A lot of writers out there have a ton of researchers and they don't get credited in the book.","I walk down the street and people don't go, 'My God, there he is.' I lead as normal a life as you can lead in New York City.","There aren't any looks or customs I wish would come back. Today almost anything goes. Culture constantly devours the past so there's not much that's missing.","There is a certain ancient civility about tailors that is welcome - especially in modern London, which is now very much an international city, not an English city. They're still a little vessel of Englishness in what is otherwise a pretty rambunctious place.","Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi looks in the mirror and sees a playboy of the old school. And men such as Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Charlie Sheen no doubt look at Berlusconi and think, 'Role model!' Women, of course, know otherwise. They see him as an aging, pathetic buffoon.","It's estimated that across Africa 100 elephants are killed for their tusks every day. It takes nothing more than simple math to get to what that adds up to in a year, and it's a distressing figure.","Americans who grew up in the 1930s or 1940s still have some fleeting memory of what the country was like before it became the steroidal superpower it is today.","Take a random selection of photographs of America in 2012 and 2002 and 1992 and, except for the skinny jeans and the porkpie hats, you'll be hard-pressed to tell the years in which the pictures were taken.","My hunch is that pop culture began to stagnate the moment Americans started to love the past more than they did the future.","Christopher Hitchens was a wit, a charmer, and a troublemaker, and to those who knew him well, he was a gift from - dare I say it - God.","As someone who came to New York in the 1970s, I was, like so many of my friends, a certified member of what we now call the 99 percent - and I was a lot closer to the bottom than to the top of that 99 percent. At some point during the intervening years, I moved into the 1 percent.","Somewhere along the way, New York became all about money. Or rather, it was always about money, but it wasn't all about money, if you know what I mean. New York's not Geneva or Zurich yet, but we're certainly heading in that direction. London is, too.","The last thing businessmen want to do is sit in a room filled with other businessmen. A room full of money is a pretty boring sight - unless it's yours, of course.","Television offers a range and scope, and a degree of creativity and daring, that the bottom-line, global-audience-obsessed, brand-driven movie industry just can't compete with.","Financial institutions like to call what they do trading. Let's be honest. It's not trading; it's betting.","Let's face it, who among us wouldn't take a pill or potion that would make us better at our job? Goodness knows, we abuse substances for just about everything in our personal lives; why not in our professional lives as well?","Where past generations had film cameras, scrapbooks, notebooks, and that part of the brain which stores memories, we now have a smartphone app for every conceivable recording need.","In the Digital Age, recorders also tend to be oversharers, and with Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Pinterest, they can do so on a grand scale.","A workday lunch that lasts as long as a transcontinental flight is an impossibility for all but the most pliant and footloose of food tourists. To get in the game, you need a thick wallet, an adventurous palate, and a whole lot of time.","I always thought eating what you wanted was one of those aspects of adulthood to be looked forward to when you were a child.","Those who remember New York in the 1970s, as I do, look back on a city that had hit a very rough patch - decaying, bankrupt, and crime-ridden. But fun.","Magazine stories, the best ones anyway, are generally a combination of three elements: access, narrative, and disclosure.","The danger of leaving overwhelming wealth and power in the grasp of a small minority is a lesson that leaders such as ousted Tunisian president Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali and deposed Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak have learned a little too late, as the demonstrations across the Arab world indicate.","As a father of five, I sometimes feel I've spent a lifetime watching Disney musicals.","Issues such as transparency often boil down to which side of - pick a number - 40 you're on. Under 40, and transparency is generally considered a good thing for society. Over 40, and one generally chooses privacy over transparency. On every side of this issue, hypocrisy abounds.","'The Guardian,' with its deep journalistic traditions, is careful about context and explanation. It sees itself as a gatekeeper, and it worries about consequences.","What do you call an electorate that seems prone to acting out irrationally, is full of inchoate rage, and is constantly throwing fits and tantrums? You call it teenaged.","As any journalist will tell you, there are few professional situations as vexing as when a friend becomes involved in a major story that you feel you must cover.","Conservatives define themselves more by their hatred of liberals than anything else, and, conversely, liberals by their distaste for conservatives.","The fact is that movie stars are as insecure as the rest of us - if not more so. Many live in a luxurious bubble in which their best friends are their trainer, their hairdresser, their publicist, and their Kabbalah instructor.","It's no surprise that the Bush administration's bullying swagger and blithe ignorance have caused much of the Muslim world to hold the U.S. in rock-bottom regard.","It could fairly be said that the U.S. is increasingly out of step with the rest of the world. As our neighbors to the south elect left-wing or even socialist governments, we are lurching further to the right. As Europe becomes less engaged to the Church, we are becoming more fundamentalist.","It could safely be said that Iraqis are dying at a faster clip since the American-led invasion and occupation than they did during the last decade of Saddam Hussein's rule.","'Green' does not have to mean the sort of hair-shirt, wood-burning-stove sensibility of the '70s. Green can and should be sleek and modern.","Former vice president Al Gore has devoted his post-administration years to a mission to tell the world about global warming. It's funny, but in his civilian life Gore has discovered the voice that voters had trouble hearing when he ran for president in 2000. The voice he has found is clear, impassioned, and moving.","I don't think you can be a credible, modern candidate for president without making the environment a major part of your platform.","Water-boarding can result in damage to the lungs and the brain, as well as long-term psychological trauma.","To a young kid growing up in Canada, America seemed to be crazy about the future; dazzled by it.","After the collapse of Wall Street in the 1920s, the culture stopped being all about money, and the country survived and ultimately flourished.","Memory is often - perhaps usually - a distorting lens: what we think we remember isn't the way it was at all. It's what we'd like to remember.","In this age of 24-7 headlines, the term 'newsweekly' seems almost quaint.","Branding experts believe that just because they have rethought a company's image or name, the rest of us will automatically fall in line.","Everything I love about America is fragile.","Every minute you invest in kids you get back four times over.","Stationery is addictive. I get mine made in Paris at Benetton, and writing on it gives me a strange thrill.","As you get older and fatter, good clothes can hide a lot.","In Britain, libel damages are small and people build them into the cost of doing business. In America, libel is very rare and much harder to prove, but the damages are enormous.","Hatred for Obama... has more to do with race than anything else.","My suggestion to newspapers everywhere is to give the public a reason to read them again. So here's an idea: get on a big story with widespread public appeal, devote your best resources to it, say a quiet prayer, and swing for the fences.","I actually don't know how magazines are produced, I'll be honest with you. I have no idea.","You have to give kids something to rebel against. You can't like their music - you have to call it noise. It's incumbent on a parent.","To discuss a Martin Amis book, you must first discuss the orchestrated release of a Martin Amis book. In London, which rightly prides itself on the vibrancy of its literary cottage industry, Amis is the Steve Jobs of book promoters, and his product rollouts are as carefully managed as anything Apple dreams up."],"Grazia Deledda":["After this, I took private lessons in Italian from an elementary school teacher. He gave me themes to write about, and some of them turned out so well that he told me to publish them in a newspaper.","According to an ancient Sardinian legend, the bodies of those who are born on Christmas Eve will never dissolve into dust but are preserved until the end of time.","I have also written some poems which have not been collected in a volume.","We later moved to Rome, where I am presently living."],"Greer Garson":["Starting out to make money is the greatest mistake in life. Do what you feel you have a flair for doing, and if you are good enough at it, the money will come.","I do wish I could tell you my age but it's impossible. It keeps changing all the time."],"Greg Abbott":["If I have to, I will use one challenge after another to dismantle governmental operations that I consider violations of the Constitution.","America is sick and tired of spending hour upon hour sitting in their automobile trying to get to work, trying to get kids to school, trying to get to a doctor's appointment.","I typically start out almost every speech I give making some kind of joke about me being in a wheelchair.","You can look at the state of California, which is on a pathway to destruction because they expanded government too much, thinking that there would always be someone to pay for it.","America is ready for livable communities. America is ready for high-speed rail.","During my time as a judge, as a justice, and as attorney general, I've had one overarching goal, and that is a strict interpretation and application of the laws and the Constitution. I would be Madisonian.","Americans get it. They're ready for some opportunities to have greener communities, to have cleaner communities, and to have transportation options that perhaps they haven't had in the past."],"Greg Akcelrod":["I am just like 99% of my friends in France, who say on their resume they can speak fluent English. In reality, they can't even count up to three.","This art of acting is a process I love very much. It's an unbelievably fulfilling experience for me and I look forward to building upon my art in the years to come.","I think if you want to become a great football player, professional, you must give all the time one hundred percent, you must work hard - to be lucky is a good thing - but if you work hard and you give everything you will have great success.","But my biggest passion is football.","I am very proud to be a part of the Livestrong Foundation. I am maybe only a member but I give everything I can to be sure that people understand that cancer is a disease for everybody - not only in France, in Europe, in Asia, it is all over the world. We must fight together, we must make something to fight the cancer, we must Livestrong."],"Greg Anderson":["Focus on the journey, not the destination. Joy is found not in finishing an activity but in doing it.","Wellness is not a 'medical fix' but a way of living - a lifestyle sensitive and responsive to all the dimensions of body, mind, and spirit, an approach to life we each design to achieve our highest potential for well-being now and forever.","Wellness is the compete integration of body, mind, and spirit - the realization that everything we do, think, feel, and believe has an effect on our state of well-being.","When we are motivated by goals that have deep meaning, by dreams that need completion, by pure love that needs expressing, then we truly live.","Let us be about setting high standards for life, love, creativity, and wisdom. If our expectations in these areas are low, we are not likely to experience wellness. Setting high standards makes every day and every decade worth looking forward to.","Wellness seeks more than the absence of illness; it searches for new levels of excellence. Beyond any disease-free neutral point, wellness dedicates its efforts to our total well-being - in body, mind, and spirit.","Although our inattention can contribute to our lack of total well-being, we also have the power to choose positive behaviors and responses. In that choice we change our every experience of life!","We have thousands of patients and family members who are dealing with dual devastation, cancer and the hurricane.","The single overriding objective in wellness is creating constant personal renewal where we recognize and act on the truth that each day is a miraculous gift, and our job is to untie the ribbons. That's the Law of Esprit: living life with joy.","Only one thing has to change for us to know happiness in our lives: where we focus our attention.","Cancer opens many doors. One of the most important is your heart."],"Greg Austin":["What suprised me most about the real Gordon Selfridge was actually about his sons, Ralph and Oliver. They were both highly respected in their fields, influencing Information Technology and Robotics deeply. Oliver Selfridge has even been referred to as 'The Father of Machine Perception,' being a pioneer in Artificial Intelligence.","When I'm not acting, you'll probably either find me playing a game or working on my YouTube channel.","I just really hope I can do justice to the whole 'Doctor Who' universe."],"Greg Bear":["Science fiction works best when it stimulates debate.","It's been a great place to get in touch with what people are really thinking. And to make contact with readers and other writers. Egalitarian, wide open, like the Wild West!","Working in Isaac's universe was more of a treat than a challenge.","Of all the planets apart from Earth in our solar system, Mars is the most hospitable. Yeah. Right. Better keep my visit short. And yet, despite the discomfort, the danger, I love it here. I love coming back for these imaginary vacations. The sights are amazing.","Why do we capital-N Nerds love Mars so much? Because it's beautiful, it's tough, it's buried in our mythic, childhood memories. It's covered with human triumphs but also with sad stories of failure.","We're told another large-scale terrorist attack is inevitable by those people who have committed so many resources to preventing it. They likely know what they're talking about.","For years, even before 9/11, I've been trying to warn that the threat from amateur biolabs will ultimately turn out to be far more troublesome than leakage from military labs - perhaps even more costly and deadly than nuclear terrorism.","It's kind of a misnomer about science fiction that science fiction is about anything other than people. It's about people doing stuff, sometimes doing extraordinary stuff.","Ray Bradbury is, for many reasons, the most influential writer in my life. Throughout our long friendship, Ray supplied not only his terrific stories but a grand model of what a writer could be, should be, and yet rarely is: brilliant and charming and accessible, willing to tolerate and to teach, happy to inspire but also to be inspired."],"Greg Behrendt":["I do think that you can dress yourself out of a problem. The way that a haircut and a new pair of pants can make you feel is better than any therapist, because when you look in the mirror, you see a different person - you are a different person. It's superficial change that can lead to real change.","I don't know if you know you're funny, but you enjoy being funny. I know I'm funny because people tell me I am, but when I watch myself, it doesn't make me laugh. Does that make sense? Because I know the jokes, and to me, I feel like I'm pulling the wool over people's eyes. And there are probably people who do not enjoy what I do.","I saw Aerosmith, and I was like, 'Wow, you can dress like a girl and still get girls? Hand me a scarf!'","The one cool thing with getting older is that you can actively choose to just be an eccentric.","Social media is a really cool way to tell your story to people who are interested in hearing it. It's not getting put through the filter of a television executive who's decided you're too old to justify the expenditure.","This life is yours and no one else's, and if you spend your time looking at other people's pages, you'll never get anything done.","The best thing that can happen in a relationship is when you are the same person you were before the relationship started. You are not hiding anything, and you still have a life of your own. The other best thing is sex - that is a super positive.","I've never tried to pass myself off as anything more than a comedian who wrote a dating book.","Part of being a comedian is that it's your job to look at life and regurgitate it in a funny way, to point out its absurdities.","I get giddy with the idea of stringing words together that make people laugh.","The great thing about comedy is that the longer you've been alive, the more you have to talk about and the better you get. I've got some miles and some road savviness that some other guys don't have.","I was always funny, but I wasn't a great musician, and I wanted to be a musician way more than I wanted to be a comic. I just didn't think comedians were cool when I was a kid.","Most comics worship music on some level. It's more rock-n-roll to get up there for an hour and make people laugh.","Most authors writing books like 'He's Just Not That Into You' dream of doing what I was being asked to do. I didn't like it. I'm good at giving advice, but doing it on TV and radio felt wrong, and when people resisted my point of view, I was like, 'Why am I doing this? This was not the plan.' So I stopped. It didn't make me feel good.","I don't have a massive fan base. I don't have Patton Oswalt numbers, but the fan base I have is incredibly generous, and of the 22,000 people who follow me on Twitter, I think almost all of those people participate.","I went to stand-up when my rock n' roll dreams weren't coming true. I knew it wasn't going to happen when I was in a New Wave band in 1992 - at the height of grunge. Then I heard No Doubt's 'Spiderwebs' and I said, 'Well, we're done.' They did - and succeeded at - what we were trying to do.","We were raised to pursue women... Most of the guys I know enjoy the pursuit. But that doesn't mean women should be wallflowers.","I love astute observations and really great wordplay. I love the way that Louis C.K. observes life, and I love the way Patton Oswalt talks about it.","I'm not a big fan of comedy roasts because most of the time I find them to be really mean, but once in a while, you'll hear something perfectly worded and well-crafted.","I've learned that anything in life worth having comes from patience and hard work.","I think probably - I think, you know, when you're first dating somebody, if they're just not that physical with you, if they don't want to make concrete plans with you, you know, if they're sort of ambiguous about where everything is going, I think that's a pretty good sign that they're not into you."],"Greg Berlanti":["The thing that I probably enjoy the most and also am the best at in whatever art form I'm working in is being the protector of the emotional experience of the audience.","'Flash' has a family drama element, 'Arrow' has a epic saga/crime element, 'Supergirl' has a young-woman-in-the-city and a workplace element, and 'Legends' is like the Dirty Dozen teaming up.","If I had to give odds, I would say 30 percent of whatever good fortune I've had in this business has been luck, and 50 percent has been casting - so that's 80 percent right there. And 20 percent is just working really hard and taking risks.","Early episodes of TV I compare to out-of-town plays. You can make them better. You don't have all the time in the world, but you have time to make them better and improve them as you go along.","That's part of what always fascinated me about the Flash. Yes, he had superpowers, but he wasn't superhuman. He was vulnerable. He could be hurt or killed. He's not getting in a jet. He actually is the jet. So he had this gift, but with it came this risk. And I think that's what makes the character relatable.","I love telling stories. Creating a character, a world, a whole universe out of nothing. That part I can't get enough of.","I think a lot of what I've done is about people feeling as if they are part of the world but also not part of it at the same time. I don't know whether that's from being a gay kid, but I definitely think that resonates with me.","You have to always try to think about them like real people first, and not just heroes. They have to be real characters. As people do more and more superhero stuff, the characters are what distinguish it, just like in cop shows.","There were only a couple of Marvel characters I read. I read 'Iron Man.' I have a lot of those. And this was the time they tried X-Factor out. I was never an X-Men person, but I was like, 'Let me check out X-Factor.' I was more of a DC guy in general.","It's one of the things that 'Everwood' - what makes a great 'Everwood' episode is when it makes you laugh and cry, sometimes at the same time. From the first season, we've always had the chance to deal with death in a very real way, in a way that a lot of other shows can't or don't.","'Everwood' I think provides a unique feeling, an emotional experience. And other shows on TV don't have the acting talent to do that. Each one of our actors can do a serious scene and a humorous scene, and can do it all within the same sequence. They can go from a heartbreaking moment to a humorous moment.","Television is ultimately a business of failure. You try a lot of things, and most of it fails.","Especially with DVRs nowadays, people have their roster. More and more, it's not just, 'I'll watch what's on at 9 P.M.' They have their backlog of the shows they always watch, that they record every week, and it's a matter of, how do you get into that list?","For me, the romantic comedies I love are the ones that pay homage to the genre, but also find their ways to twist it and tweak it.","We did 'Jack & Bobby' in the middle of the Kerry/Bush election. It hurt it a little bit. No matter what we did, everyone thought we were advocating for one person over the other. The stuff I work on is more about the people.","What I really appreciated about Obama in the last campaign was that he was not reactive, and we're such a reactive culture... It takes a certain strength to be patient and have a plan.","For most of my childhood, even through college, there was a lot of feeling very alone. I loved TV, so when those very special episodes of anything came, or when certain characters reflected the world I lived in, I felt connected.","I have a Twitter profile, but I avoid red carpets and all that kind of stuff. I'd rather no one talk about me ever, and I just get to do my thing. I'm an introvert.","TV's job is to make you lean in, and a film's job is to make you lean back.","I read some Marvel, but I was more of a DC guy. Particularly the Flash, Barry Allen. I latched on to him because I felt like him. You thought to yourself, 'Well, you can't really be Superman.' You couldn't really be Batman - Batman was a really dark figure. I identified with Barry Allen's hopefulness.","I didn't happen to be one of those gay kids who knew definitively by the time I was 13.","I was a DC fan; The Flash was always my favorite character. He was sort of the most average guy amongst all of these icons, even though he had super speed, you know?","The most important decision you can make as a showrunner when you're doing a pilot is who's in it and who's directing it.","There were moments where Supergirl gets a thrashing in the pilot, where if a man in the 'Flash' or 'Arrow' pilot got beat up, people didn't visibly wince. And I watched in testing, people in the audience really became uncomfortable by the fisticuffs and the action. But then, they were elated and cheering at the end.","When we started 'Arrow,' there weren't really a lot of superhero shows in general. And it was a burden on us because it was, 'Are you going to fail or succeed?' And now they're everywhere.","There are a few reboots I'd love to see that I'd love to have nothing to do with! I'd love to watch just as a viewer. 'Quantum Lea' - someone should bring that back. I'd love to see another 'Star Trek' show on the air. I loved 'Buck Rogers'; someone should do that. But I don't want the responsibility of doing any of those things.","In TV, in general, the more you try and please everybody, the less people you please.","To me, there's still nothing more thrilling than, every week, people getting to see another chapter in this story that you're telling.","There is nothing I've wanted more, or waited for longer, than to be a father.","People don't really see television shows and movies as different anymore. They expect the same quality.","I can remember when there were storylines with gay characters on shows like 'Family' and 'Dynasty' and thinking, I have something in common with that person. This was way before the Internet and all the visibility that has brought with it."],"Greg Boyle":["Don't forget, you are the hero of your own story.","Even gang members imagine a future that doesn't include gangs.","You stand with the least likely to succeed until success is succeeded by something more valuable: kinship. You stand with the belligerent, the surly and the badly behaved until bad behavior is recognized for the language it is: the vocabulary of the deeply wounded and of those whose burdens are more than they can bear.","When the vastness of God meets the restriction of our own humanity, words can't hold it. The best we can do is find the moments that rhyme with this expansive heart of God.","You prevent kids from joining gangs by offering after-school programs, sports, mentoring, and positive engagement with adults. You intervene with gang members by offering alternatives and employment to help redirect their lives. You deal with areas of high gang crime activity with real community policing. We know what works.","You can't reason with gang violence: you can't talk to it, sit it at the table, and negotiate with it.","What is ultimately compelling for our children in helping them conjure images of a future for themselves is our willingness to walk with them as they do it.","For over twenty years, Homeboy Industries has chosen to stand with those on the margins and those whose burdens are more than they can bear; it stands with the poor and the powerless, with the easily-despised and the readily-left out.","We need a pope to oversee not simply a modernization of the church but its total transformation.","Gangs are bastions of conditional love, and one of the ways to counteract it is to offer community, which will always trump gang, and that's what happens at Homeboy Industries.","What do we know to be true about gang violence? We know we will fail if we fixate on the symptoms and not address what undergirds it.","Redemption is possible, and it is the measure of a civilized society.","No kid is seeking anything when he joins a gang; he's always fleeing something. He's not being pulled; he's being pushed by the circumstances in which he finds himself.","You are so much more than the worst thing you've ever done.","Our best selves tell us that 'there but for the grace of God... ' and that, in the end, there is no distance, really, between us and them. It is just us. Our best and noble hope is to imitate the God we believe in. The God who has abundant room in God's grief and heart for us all.","If you are paying attention, then the day is going to be pretty joyful, and a lot of delight will fill it.","My job isn't to fix or rescue or to save. It's to accompany, see people, listen to them.","There is no 'them' and 'us.' There is only us.","I don't save people. God saves people. I can point them in the right direction. I can say, 'There's that door. I think if you walked through it, you'd be happier than you are.'","Anyone who knows gangs knows that lawmakers cannot conceive of a law that would lead a hard-core gang member to 'think twice.'","I kinda don't do guilt. I gave it up for Lent years ago.","The arms of God reach to embrace, and somehow you feel yourself just outside God's fingertips.","Homeboy Bakery is an alternative to kids who have found themselves, regrettably, in gangs and want to redirect their lives.","I always have a funny story at communion time that underscores that no one is perfect, and that communion is not for perfect people but for hungry people.","You are exactly what God had in mind when he made you.","I know now that gang warfare is not the Middle East or Northern Ireland. There is violence in gang violence, but there is no conflict. It is not 'about something.' It is the language of the despondent and traumatized.","Gangs are born of a lethal absence of hope, and hope has an address: 130 W. Bruno St. in Los Angeles, CA 90012.","Reactive and proactive policing are both necessary. Still, we need to lower expectations that such efforts can ever be responsive to crime.","I have never seen a hopeful person join a gang.","The desire of God's heart is immeasurably larger than our imaginations can conjure.","I think not everything that works helps, and not everything that helps works.","Metro police can't infuse hope into those for whom hope is foreign. The algorithm does not exist that can heal the traumatized. Data-driven predictions won't result in the delivery of mental health services.","I founded Homeboy Industries in 1988 after I buried my first young person killed in our streets because of gang violence.","I have a lot of people in my life, and I think there's something key: the thing that leads to intimacy and relationship and connection is tenderness.","Children find themselves adrift not because the informational signposts are illegible, but because there is no one around to guide and accompany them.","The draconian spirit that seeks to enhance penalties and to lower the age at which juveniles will be tries as adults, is part of the 'whole cloth' of three strikes. Our failure to address the depair of our inner-city youth is only delayed by our over-confidence in a stance that is 'tougher than thou.'","Abject poverty, political instability, torture, and other abuses push thousands across our border. There is not a deterrent imaginable that equals the conditions that force their migration.","Showing up in the lives of children is everything.","God seems to be an unwilling participant in our efforts to pigeonhole Him.","I do believe in lessons learned. I have learned that you work with gang members and not with gangs; otherwise, you enforce the cohesion of gangs and supply them oxygen.","Homeboy Industries has chosen to stand with the 'demonized' so that the demonizing will stop; it stands with the 'disposable' so that the day will come when we stop throwing people away.","The task of dealing comprehensively with gangs belongs to the city, not to law enforcement.","As much as I dislike the suggestion of single solutions to complex problems, jobs are as close as we will get to a single, effective answer to the enormous problem of gangs.","I want to be prophetic and take stands and stand with those on the margins, and I want to laugh as much as I can.","We need the disruption of categories that lead us to abandon the difficult, the disagreeable, and the least likely to go very far.","Delegations from all over the world visit Homeboy Industries and scratch their heads as we tell them of our difficulty in placing our people in jobs after their time with us. Americans' seeming refusal to believe in a person's ability to redeem himself strikes these folks as foreign indeed.","Gang members aren't frightened into acceptable behavior by increased penalties, enhanced punishments, and the promise of new detention facilities.","God is compassion.","The powers, conditions, and desires that propel Mexicans and Central Americans into this country are so fundamental, so vast, that no action, legislative or other-wise, can discourage this flight.","The margins don't get erased by simply insisting that the powers-that-be erase them.","Dorothy Day, Cesar Chavez - these are people whose thoughts are so important.","We don't need a specialized gang unit. We need patrol officers who specialize in knowing their community.","The highest hallmark of a civilized society is not the rapidity by which it exacts vengeance, but its ability to hold victim and victimizer in its compassionate heart.","Jesus did not only serve the needs of the people, but truly hoped that the people and Jesus would be one.","I'm the priest who has been mistaken for an ATM machine.","People have started to see that 'smart on crime' rather than 'tough on crime' makes sense.","People have to see that there is a high degree of complexity about belonging to a gang. It's a symptom, not a problem.","In Los Angeles, the gang capital of the world, we have 1,100 gangs and 120,000 gang members so it is a daunting, complex social dilemma.","The employer is not going to choose the gang member who's just been released from prison: they're going to choose the person with the skills.","Kids are different from adults. They are not as developed as far as brain science, controlling impulses, and maturity, and fall prey to all kinds of pressures.","Young people can change and grow. Every parent knows that.","The wrong idea has taken root in the world. And the idea is this: there just might be lives out there that matter less than other lives.","I wouldn't trade my life for anybody's.","Does God feel like that same-sex marriage could happen? I don't think anybody who has a connection to God and God's understanding and depth of compassion who's gonna say 'no.'","The Church should say, 'I'm frightened that women will be ordained;' that's honest, say that. But don't say, 'It's a grave sin,' because that's nonsense.","I'm not opposed to success.","All politics are local, and so in church.","My church is in the detention facilities where I preside and celebrate the Eucharist. To me that's the church. That's the people of God.","At its best, an injunction creates a kind of vigilant heat that moves kids toward the light.","God can get tiny if we're not careful.","Businesses have come and gone at Homeboy Industries. We have had starts and stops, but anything worth doing is worth failing at. We started Homeboy Plumbing. That didn't go so well. Who knew? People didn't want gang members in their homes. I just didn't see that coming.","The poor evangelize you about what's important and what is the Gospel, and that that's where the joy is.","Ours is a God who waits. So who are we not to?","I love movies.","I know two L.A.s. Half my life was around the house my folks had for 46 years at 3rd and Norton. The other half was in Boyle Heights on the Eastside, working with gang members.","I work with gang members, and I feel a kind of affinity and gift, even. But who would've thunk it, you know? I mean, I didn't anticipate it.","You don't really get Jesus saying very often there'll be pie in the sky when you die. He's really talking about now and today, and it's supposed to be like that. You're supposed to delight in what's right in front of you.","We ought not to demonize a single gang member, and we ought not to romanticize a single gang.","I think that any program that's born from below rather than on high is going to survive.","Most employers just aren't willing to look beyond the dumbest or worst thing someone has done.","The business of second chances is everybody's business.","We lose our right to be surprised that California has the highest recidivism rate in the country if we refuse to hire folks who have taken responsibility for their crimes and have done their time.","I feel called to be faithful.","I don't believe in mistakes. Everything belongs, and, as the homies say, 'It's all good.'","Me wanting a gang member to have a different life would never be the same as that gang member wanting to have one.","Relapse happens, especially when you're dealing with folks who are frankly the least likely to succeed based on their own pasts and difficulties. We can work with the most likely to succeed. I'm not interested in that.","The idea that any law enforcement agency or person would ever know these gang members better than Homeboy Industries is impossible.","I'm not going to be here forever. I don't plan on going anywhere, but I don't know anybody for whom death is an exception.","There is no such thing as a bad cop, only disturbing and dominant cop thinking that will invariably lead to excessive force and tragic outcomes.","We can't get at crime unless we know what language it speaks. Otherwise, we are just suppressing the cough, not curing the disease.","I spent the summers of 1984 and 1985 as an associate pastor at Dolores Mission Church, the poorest parish in the Los Angeles archdiocese. In 1986, I became pastor of the church.","Richard Rohr is a theologian that I read.","I've never met an evil person ever.","I'm not always optimistic, but I am hopeful.","As a society, we come up lacking in many of the marks of compassion and wisdom by which we measure ourselves as civilized.","We are among the handful of countries that has difficulty distinguishing juveniles from adults where crime is concerned. We are convinced that if a child commits an adult crime, that kid is magically transformed into an adult. Consequently, we try juveniles as adults.","The mark of our society as civilized will come when we embrace confidence in the power of redemption.","If the Los Angeles Police Department had enough officers, it could focus on one part of the community and stay there long enough to know and respect the people the officers are called on to protect and serve.","The power of community policing is in the relationship. This can happen only if an officer sticks around for a while.","It has become an accepted tenet that kids will rarely listen to their parents but seldom fail to imitate them. Communicating the message has never been a good substitute for 'showing up' and embodying the message.","The church needs a pope who can call us to conversion and lead us to take seriously what Jesus did.","We need a pope to usher in a new era of inclusion, the end of a sinful clericalism, and a strong sense of duty to those on society's margins. The 1 billion faithful long for a leader who is fearless and driven - not by terror but by love.","We can't just settle for the low bar of pope as media-savvy, canny Curia manager.","I would hope that government officials have a healthy respect for the complexity of the gang problem. They should never lose sight of the fact that there are human beings involved. There is no single solution.","I didn't take my vows to the LAPD.","The truth is this: Brutalized, victimized children invariably will brutalize and victimize when they grow up. Is our only response to this the certain promise that we will penalize them when they do? Or will we commit to keeping our children safe from brutality and victimization?","Most citizens viewing the tape of Rodney G. King being beaten by police officers were stunned and uncomprehending. Most citizens, that is, but the urban poor.","We are less than honest and commit a grave error if we insist that what happened to Rodney G. King was isolated and an exceptional case. The poor know better.","We need not wait for further, well-placed home video cameras to see that low-intensity warfare is being waged against low-income minorities. We need only listen to the voices of the poor; they can testify that they are dehumanized, disparaged, and despised by the police.","The highest religious and spiritual ideals of any faith would invite us to a compassion for all lives destroyed by the violence that plagues us.","In my barrio, jobs work and money saves lives. When I have had the funds to place a gang member on a job site and pay his salary, I've seen him stop banging. When, on the rarest of occasions, an employer has offered a job to one of these youth, I've witnessed kids suddenly have a reason to get up in the morning.","So complex are all the ingredients that cause gang membership that it seems virtually impossible to isolate one solution that can address them all and thereby manufacture a hope for the future upon which these kids can rely.","Like the suffering child, gang members act out of their despair, and their actions are all the more alarming now for our not having heeded their cry long ago. The shortsighted neglect that keeps us locked up in our outrage has also kept us from viable solutions."],"Greg Brenneman":["Being a consultant is like flying first-class. The food is terrific, the drinks are cold. But all you can do is walk up to the pilot and say, 'bank left.' If you're in management, you have the controls.","It's all about having a product that you're proud of and coming to work every day. Those basic building blocks are the same in any business.","The whole concept of treating people with dignity and respect is a concept that isn't a business concept, it's a life concept. It's who you are at the end of the day.","I don't like Las Vegas. I'd rather be mountain biking or climbing.","When you run a company, you need to be pretty open-minded. There are a lot of different views on faith, on religion, on many different issues, and you can't let your own faith be the barometer.","If you have a chance of working for a healthy company or a sick one, choose the sick one. The sickest ones need the best doctors and it's a lot easier to stand out in a company that needs help.","The most important thing is that you treat everybody incredibly well and lead with a bit of humility. I've found that when I go into a company to lead, it's important to have a plan and to make that plan a simple one that everybody can understand.","I usually tell people upfront what to expect, and that I really want their feedback and their ideas, and if they think I've got a hair out of place or food stuck in my teeth, gosh, I want to know that.","I pass on any opportunity I see that I can't add value on.","I do not run late. Growing up on a farm, you're just not late when it's time to do chores or go to work. I grew up Mennonite, and so that work ethic and timeliness was just ingrained in me from a very young age.","What I love to do is take on business challenges in a way that really can have an impact on peoples' lives.","I love making a difference, and doing it quickly.","There's nothing magic about working with franchisees. What you have to do is help them improve their business.","Financing is tough, and you really have to work hard in the businesses you invest in.","What you can do is ask: 'What is the value to the customer? What are they willing to pay for?' Then, deliver great products and services.","It's hard for the same people who put you in the ditch to pull you out of it.","It's all about the money. Write a check, and you can build anything you want.","Burger King's business model was broken. But it was like sex in the '50s. Everyone knew it, but no one would talk about it.","I got more out of the farm than Harvard Business School.","I'm not bothered by the food Nazis. Customers ought to be able to pick what they want to eat.","Business is a team sport.","As business people, we have to remind ourselves that it's up to us to create jobs.

I keep finding new ways to say it. I love saying 'Booyakasha.'","Every Halloween for six years, I was a Ninja Turtle, and Mikey was my favorite. The turtles really made me who I am today. They got me into martial arts, meditation, surfing, skateboarding; big time influence on who I am today.","I park two blocks away from Nickelodeon studios and I hop on my skateboard and I skateboard the rest of the way to the studio.","Love is the most ferocious and strongest force on the planet.","Usually for cartoons, I record them in the mornings from 9 A.M. to noon, then I have the rest of the day to do on camera. It actually gives me time to work on my own projects.","I grew up watching Mickey Mouse and going to Disney World, like, 2,000 times. Mickey Mouse is like my guru.","'Turtles' was by far my favourite TV show when I was growing up. It would be the show that I would wanna watch more than anything. We'd record it on the big VHS tapes, and I'd watch it before school, after school, on the weekend, wear the costume, have all the weapons.","I got to work with Paul Walker. He's an angel. He was so sweet.","I love directing. I love creating things that I don't necessarily even have to be in. I like creating worlds. So I'm getting into writing movies and selling movies and television shows and creating worlds that then get to live beyond me.","I don't watch TV. Only while I'm doing it do I see it, really. So I don't know anything. I only know old reggae artists. So that's my thing. Old reggae artists and martial arts.","I became third in the U.S. as a junior pro surfer.","I do as much outdoor stuff as I can. What I've done is I bought a house in the middle of Hollywood, but I live in the forest. I literally live in an area that looks kind of like where I camped as a kid, but in the middle of Hollywood. It's called Laurel Canyon.","It's either I have to be in the trees or in the ocean, otherwise I lose my mind. I have to get connected with nature, otherwise I don't feel very good. And that's what life's about, feeling good, so nature knows best for me."],"Greg Daniels":["I'm like a slow starter. Everything I've done has built, or has taken a while.","I wrote Steve Carell's last episode. I think it was a really good episode, but there's always a tension between what's good for the series and what's good for an episode, because the more closure you put on an episode, the more significant feeling it is.","When you do something unusual, the audience doesn't 100 percent know what you're up to in the beginning. And if you're doing a character comedy, they haven't learned the characters yet.","When you think about 'The Simpsons' or 'King of the Hill' or something like that, the worlds tend to expand each episode, because there's no additional cost incurred to hire an animated character.","Whenever the boss has 'fun' activities, there's got to be a parable or a lesson. Employees feel like they're supposed to be taking notes.","On a daily basis, you're working with Steve Carell; you're not working with Ricky Gervais. You try a line, and you can't be writing for David Brent. You have to be writing for Michael Scott because Steve is Michael Scott.","It happened to me on 'King of the Hill,' where I'd left it before the end and didn't really participate in the ending, and I always felt a little bit like I wanted to try a different version of that story.","I would encourage people that, if you are waiting for the end of 'The Office,' to re-tune in right away. It is the beginning of the end, where we start to break down what's going on with this documentary and see behind the scenes with who is involved.","There are Michael Scott moments, which are character choices, but there are also Steve's reads. Usually the things that I'm the biggest fan of are these weird reads that he does - just the way he's interacting with other people.","I love 'The Office' format so much that I wanted to close it out.","I had my idea of what the series finale of 'King of the Hill' would be, but that's not what the actual series finale was."],"Greg Dworkin":["One billion people in 175 countries will mark Earth Day.

Most of human civilisation has moved inside computers; essentially, a major branch of our descendants consists of conscious software.","Fandom is about fandom, it's a great big social club.","I admire David Lynch so much, and I think he made some bad decisions with Lost Highway.","I don't have any structured grand plan; I just intend to keep writing about the things that interest me-some of which change, some of which don't.","I hadn't given much thought to the prospect of a Hugo nomination at the time it happened, but obviously once you're nominated, winning one seems a bit less far-fetched than before.","I think new writers everywhere need opportunities to get published.","I'm rarely grabbed by anything the way I was when I was 10 years younger. About the only relatively new artists whose albums I own are Beck, and They Might Be Giants.","I've been taking longer to write stories lately.","I've supported myself by writing since 1992, and I'm probably very nearly unemployable by now because employers are likely to be put off by the long gap.","Pop science goes flying off in all kinds of fashionable directions, and it often drags a lot of SF writers with it. I've been led astray like that myself at times."],"Greg Evigan":["I am back in Los Angeles after a very successful run in Chicago as Billy Flynn.","You can't know about marriage until you try it.","I'm a tek addict myself. No matter where you are, people are looking for something to tear them away from reality, challenge their state of mind.","I've been playing the bad guy in the last seven or eight projects I've done. I like it. It's a lot more interesting! Being the good guy gets a little stale after a while, you know?","Sci-fi fans are the most loyal fans on the planet - there's no doubt about it. I've done a few of those conventions, and these people will know the lines!","I'm actually in my 22-year-old son Jason's band, After Midnight Project. The music is like Coldplay-ish rock."],"Greg Fitzsimmons":["What is most difficult is when the large part of me that is a narcissist grows weary and is overtaken by the self-loathing part that always lurks in the shadows waiting for an opportunity to shine.","When I was in college, I would go out, and I would go to these open mic nights at Stitches and Nick's Comedy Stop, so I was going to classes during the day, and then at night, I would be signing up on the lists.","I'm sure people are shocked when they see a guy speeding and cutting them off and having road rage while in a Prius.","I feel life is to be lived. You want to spend your time doing things and being with friends and all that.","There's so many ways to do stand up, and I think for awhile, people weren't really maximizing the freedom of it.","The compulsion to do the opposite of what you are told does not lend itself to many occupations outside the entertainment industry. Within the industry, it is unlikely that you will be very successful without it.","Since first hearing the story as a child, any mention of the 'Boston Tea Party' has elicited in me an excitement that is uniquely American. When I heard rumblings that there was a new Tea Party, I got goose bumps. I love tea, I love parties, I hate taxes; I'm in! It seemed that most of America joined in my excitement!","Growing up with Bronx Irish parents during an era of protests against the status quo, I was especially committed to doing the opposite of what I was told to do. Forty-four years later, I am left with only one means of making a living: comedy.","Driving around with a receding hairline and two kids in a Prius feels a bit boring for me.","When I work in San Francisco doing stand-up, I usually schedule it for July, and we'll drive up the coast and camp in Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Big Sur, and we'll just camp our way up the coast, and then we'll get to San Francisco and hang out there for four days.","I don't like to change things too much. I think pretty hard about things before I jump in, and once I do, I feel, 'All right, I don't want to waste the energy of buying, selling this, going on Consumer Reports, test driving, buying, selling a house.' I feel life is to be lived.","My dad was in radio; he was a broadcaster, and it was in the family. He hosted kind of a game show at one point on TV; he was the original host of 'Good Day New York,' and he hosted the Jerry Lewis telethon for 15 years.","I don't gamble anymore since I had a kid. I have fun in Vegas. I see shows, Cirque du Soleil. Don Rickles was in town last time I was there. I'll have lunch with George Wallace. I just look in the Weekly calendar and see who's performing, and inevitably, we all meet up late night at one of the casinos.

Honestly, I think we have too many lawyers in Washington. Maybe we need some more engineers. They're trained to solve problems, and we can actually do math, which is a desperately needed skill back there.","I concluded that I know how to start and grow software companies. The worthwhile thing I could do was create livelihoods for people.","How old was Noah when he built the ark? 600. He wasn't, like, cashing Social Security checks; he wasn't hanging out - he was working.

They would have stayed if there had been a job here.","At RightNow, we employed gays, and we ran a complete meritocracy.","Even if we raised the minimum wage to $15 an hour, it's still hard to prosper on that wage.","I'm more concerned about maximum wages, not minimum wages.","At 33 years old, I didn't have to work anymore.

That's the most important ingredient.","I still think the best metal bands have a blues feel. The first Black Sabbath album is kind of a bludgeoning of blues. Deep Purple also started out as a blues band.","As a label, you have to treat every group and every record as a unique entity. I think that that has been our success, rather than relying upon a fan base.","Black Flag was formed in 1977. We first recorded in 1978.","I didn't have a lot of overtly political songs. I think it was more the actions of the group that were threatening to the authorities, and also our political philosophies apart from the music.","I didn't want to wait around for some business entity to come around and give me money and tell me what to do. We just started releasing records as best we could.","I had business experience. I had made my living designing and building electronic equipment. Basic business was not new to me, but the music business was completely new to me. I knew nothing about distribution, or any of those things.","I like a lot of electronica. I like older jazz rather than newer.","I listen to everything that comes in. I'm not real worried about demo sound quality. I can hear through that sort of thing. If a band can play, then they can play.","It took us two years to get our first real gig. That was a big dream. We ended up booking a lot of our own gigs and putting on a lot of our own shows. We were trying to get our actual music across, trying to make a connection there.","Most good things happen with time; especially music, which needs time to breathe and to find its own way.","People from major labels were afraid to go to Black Flag gigs throughout most of the band's existence. They treated our gigs as something threatening. I'm sure that it probably was. They probably had reasons to be scared.","Punk rock really came out of N.Y. as a philosophy before the groups were ever recorded. I had a kind-of intellectual interest in the idea of creating a new scene that could be a grassroots thing.","Putting out the things that I like best hasn't been the easiest way to run a label, and it still isn't because it requires finding an audience for each record.","SST was formed to put out the first Black Flag record. Basically, there wasn't anyone else to do it. I felt that what I was doing with Black Flag was very worthwhile, and I wanted to get it out there.","Stores can be indifferent to something new.","The biggest disappointment has been seeing the number of people in this business with very shortsighted views.","The English scene got more media attention with their emphasis on fashion, with the safety pins and all. There were some really good bands over there. The Sex Pistols were great.","The Minutemen were seen as more of an art thing than Black Flag, although I didn't see them that way. It confused people when we put out Saccharine Trust, too.","The public is usually slow to catch on to new things, and it's important that musicians stick to their guns and not look for that instant gratification.","The REM and Nirvana successes don't mean much to me except as a potential distraction for bands who want to cash in on the trend. Don't try to sound like someone else. REM and Nirvana don't sound like anyone else.","The small companies who feel that the majors are a threat, or are predators, will use that as an excuse for their eventual downfall. Don't blame others for your own inadequacies.","There are several books out on punk history, but I haven't read any of them. I was there.","There aren't enough people who are scaring the kind of people who work at these record companies.","There's not much music I'll listen to if it doesn't have pretty heavy swing. Rhythm is so important. Punk rock would have more power and feeling if it had swing.","We aren't as concerned about the live aspect as other labels. The best live bands are the easiest to record.","We had a lot of riots. We came under attack from many of the police departments. It certainly wasn't some publicity thing. I was afraid for many years. We couldn't play in LA for many years. A lot of people got very cynical.","We were excited when we sold our first 10 records. I always felt that if we could get the music out there, and if people became accustomed to it, then a substantial number of them would enjoy it.","We're not good at propping up old carcasses. We want to be on top of what's vital at any particular time, and not just hold onto something because it has a name.","We've gotten involved in cat rescue - we take them in and find homes for them. I've always loved cats. I saw how homeless cats were living out there. We take them in, put out flyers.","You have to keep the business side together as well as the creative side. We have constantly surprised people and stayed with bands until they have grown on people."],"Greg Giraldo":["I've always had real trouble knowing what my actual desires and goals are. I've just been dragged along by fate.","The hardest part, for real, is probably when you just don't feel like going on stage and being funny.","There are no black people in Iraq, so how will they know who to shoot at?","Why do we need another station where everyone has a gun? We already have BET.","The reality is I'm not a 'get knocked down and come back harder' kind of guy.","It's hard to distinguish when I was actually struggling from when I only felt like I was struggling - which was pretty much always.","The reality is I'm not this person with this driving 'get it done' attitude.","If you spend five minutes with me or watch me try to balance my checkbook, you can only imagine the disaster I would make of anyone's legal issues.","Little did I know that earning a living at stand-up is the hardest thing you can do. But once I started doing it, I just loved it, and I realized that I was actually kinda good at it, and then that was it.","Some people are just really goofy kind of guitar acts, and they go out and do these colleges and start making a fortune pretty early on. And other people - I know guys who are great comics, who've done the Letterman show many times, who still barely pay their bills.","The things that make me laugh are considered smart or whatever, I guess. But stuff that's self-consciously intelligent or self-consciously hip or cool, that doesn't do it for me either. You just try to be funny."],"Greg Graffin":["If you can believe in God, then you can believe in anything. It's a gang mentality.","I bill myself as a naturalist because if you say you're a naturalist, it gives people a conversation point to talk about what you actually do believe in, instead of when you say you're an atheist, and it's really just a statement of what you don't believe in.","Naturalism teaches one of the most important things in this world. There is only this life, so live wonderfully and meaningfully.","The thrill of science is the process. It's a social process. It's a process of collective discovery. It's debate, it's experimentation and it's verification of claims that might be false. It's the greatest foundation for a society.","Whether you reach a lot of people or have a profound impact on a few people, their memories of you are your afterlife.","Every place has its own punk flavor, but they all borrowed ideas from SoCal. It's still a vibrant scene creeping into every crevasse of youth culture. When you hear grunge, you think of the '90s, but when you hear L.A. punk, it's timeless.","Folk music usually has an emphasis on the lyrics and melody. And those lyrics are usually relevant in some way. And it's populist in scope, which is also true of Bad Religion. So it's more meant to draw some parallels between the two. And I think even my voice and my delivery can be thought of as a little bit folky.","Ideologically, the pursuit of science is not that different from the ideology that goes into punk rock. The idea of challenging authority is consistent with what I have been taught as a scientist.","Science is very vibrant. There are always new observations to be found. And it's all in the interest in challenging the authority that came before you. That's consistent with the punk rock ethos that suggests that you should not take what people say at face value.","In the family, in interpersonal relationships, even in friendship, faith is tremendously important. If you have a partner who you believe is a good person, then it is your duty to have faith in them until the end, despite the fact that they might have done some bad things. And you have to support and believe in your children.","The thread of culture that runs through the entire history of punk is also a dedication to challenging the authoritarian.","Science is the first expression of punk, because it doesn't advance without challenging authority. It doesn't make progress without tearing down what was there before and building upon the structure.","Unfortunately, the average guy on the street believes that studying evolution leads to atheism.","So much of the habitat destruction and pollution is based on the simple principle that we somehow have been given free license over other species to degrade the planet.","One of the things that all religions have is a narrative of doomsday. There has to be some kind of overarching fear of the future. If there wasn't, none of the religions could invoke this important thing - that science has no evidence of, by the way - called free will.","You can't let your personal disposition be dictated by the world around you.","A fossil is so powerful. It's moving. This is my ancestor. The naturalist is moved by the fossil... not the cross.","I've written almost 200 songs with Bad Religion. No matter where you look in our history, the focus has been trying to instill some of these disturbing realities about the world, some of the implications of evolution into an artistic format that can be interpreted by people who may never study evolution.","Unfortunately, science cannot be reduced to short, catchy phrases. And if this is all that the general public can comprehend, it's no wonder that we spend so much of our time in the interminable debate about belief in God, or lack thereof.","Bad Religion has never been about criticizing people who are Christian. But we've always been about pointing out the irony and contradictions in Christian theology and the more extreme versions of Christians that seek to challenge modern secularism.","You can't take up all the music bins at a CD retail outlet with Spice Girls CDs and leave nothing for the Joan Jett catalogue.","I've always been on a quest to use science in an artful way.","I don't mind if other people call me an atheist, but I call myself a naturalist. Atheism doesn't tell you much about what I do believe in; the term naturalist opens up the discussion better.","I don't bill myself as an atheist but as a naturalist. Naturalism is a belief system. A lot of scientists bristle at that. We all have to believe we can find the truth. Evidence is my guide. I rely on observation, experimentation and verification.","The trick is: how do you talk about natural selection without implying the rigidity of law? We use it as almost an active participant, almost like a god. In fact, you could substitute the word 'god' for 'natural selection' in a lot of evolutionary writings and you'd think you were listening to a theologian.","Most songwriters who have been lucky enough to have their song on the radio or be heard widely don't know anything about science. The best songs have a strong dose of metaphor. Most songs about science don't have that. Like 'She Blinded Me With Science.' It's a stupid song, no offense to Thomas Dolby.","We delude ourselves into believing that morality comes from somewhere else, whereas in reality we behave as we've been told to behave.","I view music as entertainment. When I'm on stage, I don't look at that as a platform for sharing ideology. Otherwise I'd be a zealot myself. That's why, when people ask me, 'Do you think you can change the world through your music?' I say, 'I doubt it.'","I was never raised with the traditional story of creation in religion, and because of that I think I had a lot of questions. And evolution, the evolutionary narrative, helped provide some of that for me.","In the 1970s, we had Carl Sagan, and he was so suave with his turtleneck and his tweed jacket. And he was, you know, he made science look cool. And in punk rock, we haven't had that. We haven't had the Carl Sagan of punk.","I've known a lot of people who were punkers who went on to get academic degrees. Very few of them, however, continued their active role in the punk community. Most of them hung up their leather jacket when they did so.","From a very early age, I was in tune with pop radio, and most of this listening was done driving. We had an old '67 or '65 Buick LeSabre, and whenever we would drive around, I would actually stick my head right against the speakers in the back and sing along to the music.","I think English punk died in '79 or '80. Maybe '82 at the latest. As far as American punk goes, it wasn't the same as English punk. It wasn't a working-class movement that was protesting the conditions under which this class had to work. I don't think American punk ever died.","I guess rock stars are role models for the kids who listen to that music. My role models have all been geologists - you know, the guys who are doing fieldwork until they're 70.","I want some fact-based evidence about where we came from. Things we consider mysterious need not be attributed to a deity.","I definitely was attracted to similar things in punk and science. They both depend on a healthy dose of skepticism.","My science teachers always encouraged their classes to 'go out and discover something' because all scientific endeavors depend on observation and experimentation. Through such pursuits, anyone can find something new to science, and if it's truly novel, the entire edifice of science might have to be restructured.","The vocal arrangements are a big part of the formula for a Bad Religion song - layered harmonies and background vocals. So when I start to describe the elements of Bad Religion's sound, it starts to sound like a Christmas choir.","I was in a choir as a kid. It was from those early days that my outlook on harmonies and arrangements were nurtured. I always took that with me, even on the earliest Bad Religion record, which strangely was only about six years after that.","Let's face it: There are people who are extremists in every corner of society, and whatever flag they're waving is something Bad Religion has stood against.","As a scientist, of course, we have to believe there is no supernatural. There are only natural entities in the universe. And those are the things that we study as natural scientists.","I'm trying to champion the naturalist's worldview and show it's not as heathen as most religious people would make it out to be.","The naturalist worldview is a good way to feel grounded and feel part of something that isn't based on fairy tales. It's based on observable facts in the human and in the biological history of the planet. I think that can be a source for comfort.","Bad Religion's tradition has always been to try and provoke people but hopefully lead them to a better sense of who they are and what they stand for. That's supposed to make them feel better.","I call myself a naturalist as opposed to an atheist, but there are different styles. Some people just like to be close to nature. And some people actually worship nature, which is too wishy-washy because - like a lot of religious believers - they don't depend on facts.","I have great hope and faith, but it's a humanistic faith based in facts; you have to believe that facts exist. We can all arrive at the same facts if we engage in the process of experimentation, observation, and verification, which can solve more of the world's major problems than a debate over whether God does or doesn't exist.","Almost everyone shuts down when science becomes too technical; you've got to infuse it with entertainment and storytelling to make it effective. From high school on, science is taught in a very dry manner, which isn't as potent.","There are so many ways to characterize evolutionary success. If one criterion is the number of millions of years that the species persists, we're still just infants. We're way too young of a species to tell if we were a creative fluke or if we have any staying power.","When I was a teenager, science meshed with my developing ideals - such as the challenge to authority that was central to punk rock. In science, anyone from any walk of life could make a discovery that would overturn prevailing hypotheses. And that was a cause for celebration among scientists.","I got interested in palaeontology and vertebrate history - sparked by books on human evolution - then vertebrate evolution. Studying with palaeontologists kindled my interest in fieldwork.","I struggled to keep one foot in music and one in academia. I had worked on my Ph.D. for three years full time before I realized Bad Religion could be a legitimate career.","Academic scientists aren't generally interested in books for the public. So when one comes out, the authors can't expect much praise from scientists. My goal both as a singer and an instructor is to educate through provocation and entertainment.","People who are creative, who do it as a lifestyle, it's kind of silly to make that claim you're done, because you just never know when that spark is going to hit you again. You can't necessarily predict how you're going to feel. In ten years I'll be 58, and I might still feel like making a punk record.","I'm saying that there were many great naturalists before Darwin's time who were very pious people and who knew more about nature than most of us. These were great naturalists; people I would admire for their knowledge of natural science given the time.","I grew up playing football since the day I could walk; some of my greatest memories of childhood are playing touch football in all kinds of weather with my best friends. That's a part of the American experience that no corporation can destroy.","You can look at Bad Religion, and, really, almost everything I've ever done was an exercise in creativity. I've always had a desire to challenge and question authority, and that's where the fire inside comes from. I challenged authority out of a desire to make things better, not to be nihilistic about it.","If you go back far enough and get a wider enough picture of history, we have let go of many things that follow a religious narrative. We don't burn witches anymore. Most people would consider that barbaric. We don't sacrifice human beings, which was a religious act practiced by numerous cultures on this planet.","People are still very uncomfortable with the idea that humans are not specially created species. I believe we are a fantastic species. But we are not created specially. That's very hard for people to accept in their day-to-day routine.","It's not a random chance that we have Alanis Morissette. She didn't evolve out of a null and void. She came from a former template. She borrowed styles and sounds from a very limited set of other artists.","Bad Religion took a long time to develop into gold-record-status artists. Along the way we learned and applied our knowledge, and Atlantic helped us every step of the way, since 1993.","I wouldn't say there's a need for the Spice Girls, but I'd say there's a place for the Spice Girls. There's certainly a place for them, but you don't promote the Spice Girls at the expense of promoting what I think are good role models for girls. You need to create some kind of equality.","I would say there's a lot of similarity between folk and punk. It's written for the common man.","One of our great thematic traditions in Bad Religion has been to question human nature.","It's been an objective of mine since I started writing songs to include both intellect and energy."],"Greg Grandin":["Just as much as the United States mattered to cotton, cotton mattered to the United States. Cotton reinvigorated slavery, established the young nation's place in the global economy, and eventually helped create the political and economic conflicts that resulted in civil war.","Berta Caceres, a Lenca woman, grew up during the violence that swept through Central America in the 1980s. Her mother, a midwife and social activist, took in and cared for refugees from El Salvador, teaching her young children the value of standing up for disenfranchised people.","Harriet Washington, in 'Medical Apartheid: The Dark History of Medical Experimentation on Black Americans from Colonial Times to the Present,' documents the smallpox experiments Thomas Jefferson performed on his Monticello slaves. In fact, much of what we now think of as public health emerged from the slave system.","Most critical histories of U.S. involvement in Iran rightly began with the joint British-U.S. coup against democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in 1953, which installed Pahlavi on the Peacock Throne. But it was Kissinger who, in 1972, greatly deepened the relationship between Washington and Tehran.","Is Donald Trump a fascist? It's an interesting question that has generated insightful commentary over the past few months, with the best answers situating Trumpian illiberalism within America's long history of racial oppression, slavery, Jim Crow apartheid, and the ongoing backlash to the loss of white privilege.","A new book by 'New York Times' reporter Charlie Savage, 'Power Wars,' suggests that there has been little substantive difference between George W. Bush's administration and Obama's when it comes to national-security policies or the legal justifications used to pursue regime change in the Greater Middle East.","On April 14, 1986, when the Reagan administration launched an airstrike on Libya in clear violation of international law, Kissinger did the rounds on news shows to justify the bombing. The day after the bombing, Kissinger appeared on ABC's 'Good Morning America' to voice his 'total support.' Attacking Libya, he said, was 'correct' and 'necessary.'","Beyond institutional amnesia, a rejection of causal analysis is the existential rock on which American Exceptionalism sits. The United States unique sense of itself depends on an ambiguous relationship to the past. History is affirmed, since it is America's unprecedented historical success that justifies the exceptionalism.","'Toughness' and 'credibility' are leitmotifs that run through both Trumpian and Kissingerian deal-making. Both men insist that war and diplomacy are inseparable and that, to be effective, diplomats need to be able to wield threats and offer incentives in equal, unrestricted measure.","Even before the expansion of slave labor in the South and into the West, slavery was already an important source of northern profit, as was the already exploding slave trade in the Caribbean and South America. Banks capitalized the slave trade, and insurance companies underwrote it.","Obama and Kuczynski each promised to do all they could to enact the Trans-Pacific Partnership.","After Plan Colombia came the Colombian Free Trade Agreement. Hillary Clinton opposed the treaty when she was running against Barack Obama in 2008 but then supported it as secretary of state.","The removal of the British after the American Revolution opened the floodgates of paramilitary ranger power. For instance, in 1786, ranger units, including one that included Daniel Boone, attacked a number of friendly Shawnee towns along the Mad River.","In the early 1800s, both Spain and Portugal disseminated the smallpox vaccine throughout the Americas via the 'arm to arm of the blacks,' that is, enslaved Africans and African-Americans, often children, who were being moved along slave routes as cargo from one city to another to be sold.","In Texas, the rangers were established on an ad hoc basis in the 1820s to protect the settlers making inroads into Spanish borderlands. Soon, Mexicans and Mexican Americans replaced Native Americans as the prime target of ranger repression.","Like Hillary Clinton in the United States, Kuczynski is a prototypical member of the trans-American governing class, with deep roots in both the private and public sector and its revolving-door relationship between Washington think tanks, the State Department, and high-level Latin American ministries.","As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton was an active promoter of increased resource extraction in Latin America, pushing both fracking and the privatization of petroleum production.","Ronald Reagan, who led the larger New Right project of re-sanctifying U.S. foreign policy after its Vietnam disaccreditation, felt compelled to drape his support for Central American death squads in the rhetoric of American exceptionalism.","If you search for Colombia on The Nation's website, you will see how key the country has been in regional politics.","One of the things that has made America exceptional - compared to other crisis-prone and class-conflicted countries - is that it has long enjoyed a benefit no other modern nation in the world could claim: the ability to engage in ceaseless, endless movement outward.","According to some tallies, since 1776, the United States has been at war 93 percent of its existence, passing through a mere 21 years of peace.","America is exceptional, it is asserted, because, with the exception of the abolition of slavery, it has been able to extend the promise of liberal reform mostly peacefully, through its democratic institutions.","Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, heavy-handedly provoked South American governments on any number of issues, including a rush to endorse the 2002 coup attempt in Venezuela, which only worked to steel resistance and build solidarity.","Honduras in 2009 and Paraguay in 2012 were low-hanging fruit, small countries with outsized oligarchies, where mild reformers were easily dispatched.","In Honduras, in particular, Hillary Clinton as Obama's secretary of state was instrumental in legitimizing the coup's subsequent death-squad regime.","Without U.S. input, the countries of South America joined forces in 2008 to shut down a coup attempt in Bolivia and prevented a war between Ecuador and Colombia.","In the 1960s, as a rising defense intellectual, Kissinger was a Nelson Rockefeller man, firmly entrenched in the center-right establishment. When he attended the infamous 1964 Republican convention in San Francisco, he was horrified by Goldwater supporters, whom he likened to fascists.","Kissinger's unusually high body count and singular moral imperiousness has the effect, among his critics, of obscuring his didactic utility. An outsized personality who has committed outsized mayhem, Kissinger eclipses his own context. Yet, as animals were to the anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss, Kissinger is good to think with.","Kissinger celebrants inevitably point to two things to justify their admiration: an opening to China - 'rapprochement' - and improved relations with the Soviet Union - detente - which included SALT, a historic arms-limitation treaty.","Endorsing Ronald Reagan in 1980, Kissinger threw in with America's new militarists, who would jump-start a revived Cold War and drive to retake the Third World.","One of the first things the PT government did when it took office in 2003, after Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva won the presidency, was to create a 'dirty list' of hundreds of companies and individual employers who were investigated by labor prosecutors and found to be using slaves.","Brazil imported more enslaved Africans than any other American nation and was the last country in the hemisphere to abolish the institution, in 1888.","The idea that Hillary Clinton wants to do to Central America what her husband did to Colombia is troubling.","As she was about to run for president in 2008, Clinton opposed a free-trade agreement with Panama - an agreement that, as Sanders pointed out, would make the kind of money-laundering we learned about from the Panama papers even more pervasive.","In 2012, Hillary Clinton's State Department, acting through its ambassador, Mari Carmen Aponte, threatened to withhold critical development aid unless El Salvador passed a major privatization law.","In 1954, Guatemala's deposed president, the democratically elected Jacobo Arbenz, was forced to strip down to his underwear and photographed before being allowed to leave the country.","The effect of Bill Clinton's NAFTA and Hillary Clinton's Colombian Free Trade Agreement has been devastating to Michigan and most of the rest of the country, and accounts for the appeal of Donald Trump.","According to Colombia's respected Escuela Nacional Sindical, as of April 2015, 105 union activists had been executed in the four years since Clinton's free-trade treaty went into effect. That's just trade unionists.","Caceres was a vocal and brave indigenous leader, an opponent of the 2009 Honduran coup that Hillary Clinton, as secretary of state, made possible.","Such is the nature of the 'unity government' Clinton helped institutionalize. In her book, 'Hard Choices,' Clinton holds up her Honduran settlement as a proud example of her trademark clear-eyed, 'pragmatic' foreign policy approach. Berta Caceres gave her life to fight that government.","America's militarized brand of malignant exceptionalism is founded on the idea that the United States transcends history.","The question of causality is complex. For some philosophers and physicists, time might not exist. And since cause-and-effect reasoning needs the concept of time - of one thing preceding another - the effort to establish causality is a mug's game, an infinite regression of increasingly unanswerable questions.","'Blowback,' as many 'Nation' readers are aware, was a term introduced into popular circulation by the late political scientist Chalmers Johnson, an old Cold Warrior turned dissident.","Hillary Clinton's progress as a public figure and politician can, in fact, be indexed perfectly by her relationship to Henry Kissinger.","As first lady, Hillary Clinton spent the early months of her husband's administration drafting healthcare-reform legislation, only to see it put on the back burner by the North American Free Trade Agreement.","In 2015, El Salvador suffered nearly 50,000 cases of dengue. Cuba had 1641 cases, no deaths, and one of the lowest incidence rates in the Americas.","Since 2010, Hillary Clinton's State Department, with the aid of Brazil, France, and Canada and in league with the Clinton Foundation and other 'philanthropists,' put into place something like a never-ending coup, an everlasting intervention.","Migrants don't come to the United States because, as Ambassador Aponte argued in her press conference, of 'lies' told by smugglers that, once here, you can't get deported. They come because their countries have been destroyed by U.S. policy.","It is a job requirement of U.S. envoys to El Salvador to be skilled in the art of the threat. And Aponte, named ambassador in 2010, is a pro. In particular, she's been tasked with making sure the former insurgent FMLN, which first won the presidency in 2009 and was reelected in 2014, reconciles itself to neoliberal reality.","The first mention of a 'ranger' is as early as 1622, during the 1622 Powhatan rebellion, a near-successful effort to drive the British out of what is now Virginia.","At issue when professional sports teams take the name of Native Americans is the problem of mimicry: having appropriated the land and wealth of America's vanquished peoples, settler culture then appropriates the supposed values and spirit of the vanquished as well.","Hillary Clinton became secretary of state under Barack Obama. It's hard to convey just how stunningly cynical she has been on Colombia: In 2008, running against Obama, she opposed, in unambiguous terms, a free-trade deal with Colombia.","The CIA's always-useful World Fact book says that a staggering 6.3 million Colombians have been internally displaced (IDP) since 1985, with 'about 300,000 new IDPs each year since 2000,' the year Bill Clinton enacted Plan Colombia. Added up, that's 2.4 million people during Clinton's eight-year presidency.","In 2000, just before leaving the White House, Clinton ratcheted up military aid to Colombia. Plan Colombia, as the assistance program was called, provided billions of dollars to what was, and remains, the most repressive government in the hemisphere.","In the 1960s, after the Cuban Revolution, CIA and FBI agents often coordinated their activities with anti-Castro Cuban exiles.","Defenders of Wilson are correct to beg for context when considering his legacy. But it is they who ignore the context: the role Wilson played in using war, including Haiti's racist counterinsurgency, to nationalize white supremacy, militarism, and Christian evangelism.","Wilson won re-election in 1916, his campaign running on the slogan, 'He kept us out of war.' But he could then betray his anti-war supporters knowing that a rising political coalition - made up, in part, of men looking to redeem a lost war by finding new wars to fight - had his back.","Decades before President Richard Nixon bet his re-election on winning the Dixiecrat vote, Wilson worked out his own Southern Strategy. Even as he was moving the nation to war, Wilson re-segregated Washington and purged African-Americans from federal jobs.","Within days of Richard Nixon's inauguration in January 1969, national-security adviser Kissinger asked the Pentagon to lay out his bombing options in Indochina. The previous president, Lyndon Baines Johnson, had suspended his own bombing campaign against North Vietnam in hopes of negotiating a broader cease-fire.","President George H. W. Bush soon launched Operation Desert Shield, sending an enormous contingent of troops to Saudi Arabia. But once there, what exactly were they to do? Contain Iraq? Attack and liberate Kuwait? Drive on to Baghdad and depose Saddam? There was no clear consensus among foreign policy advisers or analysts.","By June 1974, Treasury Secretary George Shultz was already suggesting that rising oil prices could result in a 'highly advantageous mutual bargain' between the United States and petroleum-producing countries in the Middle East.","If all Henry Kissinger contributed to the Middle East were a regional arms race, petrodollar addiction, Iranian radicalization, and the Tehran-Riyadh conflict, it would be bad enough. His legacy, however, is far worse than that: He has to answer for his role in the rise of political Islam.","The only person Henry Kissinger flattered more than President Richard Nixon was Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the shah of Iran. In the early 1970s, the shah, sitting atop an enormous reserve of increasingly expensive oil and a key figure in Nixon and Kissinger's move into the Middle East, wanted to be dealt with as a serious person.","Neoliberalism is hard to define. It could refer to intensified resource extraction, financialization, austerity, or something more ephemeral - a way of life - in which collective ideals of citizenship give way to marketized individualism and consumerism.","In its original version, the FTAA was meant to be a special carve-out for Washington and Wall Street as global 'free trade' advanced under the umbrella of the Doha round of the WTO.","Most students of Kissinger find it hard to say anything about Kissinger that isn't about the man himself. He is such an outsize figure that he eclipses his own context, leading his many biographers, critics, and admirers to focus nearly exclusively on the quirks of his personality or his moral failings.","In particular, Kissinger was a key player during a transformative period of the imperial presidency, in the 1960s and '70s, when the Vietnam War undermined the traditional foundations on which it had stood since the early years of the Cold War: elite planning, bipartisan consensus, and public support.","The unraveling of America's long mid-century domestic consensus, which ran from about 1941 to 1966, had begun earlier, under Lyndon B. Johnson.","There was a brief moment, after Haiti's 2010 earthquake, when even Bill Clinton recognized what had been done to Haiti in the name of 'free trade': the destruction of local markets and rice production.","Haiti and the Dominican Republic don't just share an island, Hispaniola, but a history, one that includes all the signal events that went into creating the modern world: Columbus, conquest, genocide, slavery, imperial war, revolution, and U.S. counterinsurgencies and military occupations.","It wasn't until 1973 that Congress and journalists began to investigate 'Operation Menu,' around the same moment that the Watergate scandal was unfolding.","The argument that capitalism was dependent on slavery is, of course, not new. In 1944, Eric Williams, in 'Capitalism and Slavery,' made the case.","Starting in the early 1800s, Southerners in the United States began to defend slavery as their 'peculiar institution,' and northerners didn't mind, since the phrase suggested that chattel bondage was quarantined from the rest of the nation: that it was, or soon would be, a relic of its past and would not define its future.","The story of how Chile, in the decades after its 1973 coup and death of democratically elected socialist president Salvador Allende, became one of the most neoliberal societies on the planet is well known."],"Greg Grunberg":["I love the iPhone - I'm a huge Mac and Apple fan.","I met my wife, I had no money, I had nothing, and I started my family without really, my career was nowhere, but I had these other businesses, I had these things I was doing to be able to afford a small home.","My limitations are - I'm not Meryl Streep. I'm not playing anything in a foreign language, or anything too far from who I am.","I was, throughout school, in the theater program. Through elementary school, junior high, high school, and then J.J. Abrams, my closest friend in the world, we were living together. He was writing, and I was trying writing; I wasn't getting paid for it like he was, but I always had the acting bug.","I opened up a frozen-yogurt business out of college. I didn't finish college; I went halfway, and then I worked for Joel Silver, the producer, as a driver for a year.","With Yowza there are no games, you don't have to check in or become the mayor or go back home and redeem anything online - you will always press one button, show the coupon at the register and save money. It's as simple as that.","I have always been business minded, always been sorta an entrepreneurial guy; I played a character on 'Felicity' that was modeled after me, actually.","I love Twitter. Twitter for me is twofold. I can use it to get out important information about charity stuff and where I'm going to be, and I can get feedback from the audience which I love."],"Greg Gutfeld":["Trump represented a movement of dissatisfaction, the dissent, unhappiness, division cultivated by years of identity politics and the bullying of arrogant, insufferable, intolerant social justice warriors who used the last two terms to punish anyone who reminded them of Daddy.","2017 may have been that year when identity politics hit a brick wall - and slumped limply on the pavement.","In the American 'melting pot,' identity politics wants to smash that pot - to bring us back to the Dark Ages, when collaboration was sparse.","There's always something heroic and romantic about taking a stand against the powers that be.","Youthful impatience obscures the endless potential for joy that's standing right in front of you.","For trance music to be good, it has to sneak up on you.","I have to say that Adam Levine is truly a daring young man to go on Twitter to bash Fox News. He's so rebellious, so subversive. I mean, for a musician, seriously, could you find a more predictable stance than that? He's as edgy as a hacky sack, which also describes his music.","As foreign attacks increase, it's easy to treat them like bad weather happening somewhere else. It's what we read over breakfast. But when that storm hits your shores, remember this: Wishful thinking never saved a single life. The truth, however, has.","President Obama's farewell speech soared, towered, dragged. True, it was longer than Reagan's, Clinton's and GWB's speeches combined. If it got any longer, it would have qualified as a third term.","Human evolution relies on cooperation, which is why identity politics feels so backward.","If pop culture is a pool, it never hurts to dive into the deep end once in a while.","Getting mad only leads to madness.","Travel like a pro, not like a hobo. That's my motto.","I think the reason why 'Red Eye' is popular is because we question the common assumptions that you find elsewhere.","For years, we talked about how the only way to really win the political battles was to win the cultural ones. And rather than simply ignore pop culture, it would be far better to give it a big fat bear hug.","Imagine Earth as a crime-ridden town, and there is one safe house. How do you keep that safe house, America, always safe? It is called vigilance.","I hate 'Rolling Stone' - because I loved it so much. I had the 'Cheap Tricks' cover and the Clash cover on my wall for years, and I just hate what happened to it. It just became the smarmy grad student that sits next to you on the bus.","Ariel Pink would be a regular on the Mike Douglas Show. Both a master songwriter and a charismatic figure, he'd wander the set like a cherubic, more likable Jim Morrison. His songs would be all over KFRC - the way Boz Scaggs ruled for one summer with 'Silk Degrees.'","I actually hate lyrics, and I hate it when they're quoted in reviews. I don't think they matter that much; it's the sounds of words - not the words - that I look for.","True, the country is divided, but it's not Right and Left. It's Left and Not Left. It is because, for liberals, politics is personal and therefore extremely loud. For the rest of us, we prefer community over calamity.","Thanks to an immersive lifestyle that involves Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, we've created a psychological three-sided mirror for our social impact on others.","The people who whine about Fox News are hypocrites - they say they're totally tolerant, but when they run into someone who doesn't share their assumptions, they say, 'Fox News is evil, and it must be stopped.'","The joy of hate reflects people who get off pretending to hate something, or hate you, in order to score political points. I call them the 'tolerati' - you know, a group of people who claim to be tolerant, except when they run into someone who disagrees with them.","I know that if I say something that's considered outrageous, a group will take it, create an email blast, and use me to raise money or to do whatever, to build their profile.","There's a difference between being politically incorrect and boorish. And we've seen that line crossed a dozen times by smart people who've mistaken politics for punditry.","The truly persuasive must step out of themselves and see their own flaws first and admit they could be wrong. Then, when they correct for that, you can be truly persuasive.","It's pointless to get all huffy about stuff.","I know that, often, people in entertainment are surrounded by 'yes' men who tell you everything is 'go.' That's never been an issue for me.","When I imagine my viewer - and it sounds saccharine - but it's a family thing. People in line for my books came as families.","Ideas are things that happen at any time because you're constantly thinking and evaluating life as if it were an eternally unsolvable math problem, which it is.","My best writing is often early in the morning and, sometimes, while working out.","I've said it before: If Queen had died and reincarnated as one person, it would be Devin Townsend.","I've interviewed everyone from Joe Strummer to Iggy Pop.","If Obama was a sonnet, Trump is a limerick. And really, which ones do you enjoy more?","Trump says what he thinks at that moment. He's a totem pole of transparency.","The rise of ISIS, the orgy of identity politics, and the political changes they brought - how could Obama not see that coming? I blame the golf.","Hollywood is always about Hollywood.","Sully's' upbeat message is that we still need humans. It was the heroically human Sully who saved those people, not some cold equation written on a chalkboard.","As machines take over the decision-making that saves lives, we are left with fewer chances to save lives later.","Obama's tenure had more dirty linen then Charlie Sheen's hamper.","The PC rebellion is about a reaction against the media academic complex, which tells us what to say - or else.","What the media does to Trump is what they did the cops - say the police are really harmful, then later ask why people are so scared of the police.","Normally, 'Saturday Night Live' is about as entertaining as an ocular migraine.","Something to keep in mind, whether you adore Obama or Trump: Drooling toadyism is not a good look on either side, and it paves the way for evil. Because while hate can drive people to do many things, love permits leaders to do all things - none of them good.","As the Left demean law-abiding gun owners, they turn flaccid when faced with the armed felon.","As liberals in charge and a media question the capabilities of police, they then limply ask why there is an anti-police atmosphere or why cops are holding back.","I guess coming out against actual evil takes guts.","Before there was radical Islam, immigration and terror didn't mix.","The explosion of jihad and its desire to export its contagious madness to all areas of the world have changed the way we view immigration.","Terror, married to technology and accommodated by progress in travel, has turned evil individuals into traveling ballistic missiles.","Islamists are nothing but guided missiles that pride themselves on taking out as many infidels as possible.","Now that President Trump is a reality, I happily have been giving him a chance to see how he does.","Trump's policies are a mix of fairly traditional things. Even his immigration stuff isn't really that new.","As a New Yorker, this is what you do: you confront, jab, and slap, sometimes wrongly, then smile and forget about it.","The frothing Trump-haters' extremism turns whatever criticism they have for the guy into mere parody.","It's the great deception in modern culture: Bad things call for noble names to cloak their evil outcomes.","Before language, cavemen simply grunted, and then they used the club. Communication changed that. It's the mechanism that created civilization and prevents its own destruction.","Do you ever see a right-wing kid violently jumping lefty speakers? On campus, you either have silent appeasement or a bruise.","The federal government is enormous; it never shrinks. And the interest is killing us.","What a contrast, Trump is feisty but flexible. Obama, cool but rigid. But he had no reason to bend. The media already bought into his shtick. His giddy fan base ate up every white-coated lie.","ObamaCare was a lemon, but the media were his lemonheads.","The modern progressive movement believes that dissenting language is objectionable, which then removes the brakes between anger and violence.","Language turned apes like us into civil creatures.","By silencing speech, the new Left makes life more dangerous by leaving violence as the only option. Maybe that's what they want.","Here is the problem with legacy: You'll sacrifice stuff that is not even yours to get it. Take President Obama's Iran deal, when he gave the shirt off his back - and ours, too.","An actual scientist embraces debate because it sharpens their research.","Social justice warriors want to return to the Dark Ages when you communicated with a club instead of joining one.","Back in the days of world wars, American companies didn't think twice about pitching in to help fight the enemy. Car companies helped bolster tanks, food companies created rations - sometimes they had to do it, but no one had to twist their arm.","Here is a fact: If Facebook were a religion, it will be the third largest behind Islam and Christianity. Its success is rooted and capitalizing on the human desire to bond.","Identity politics preaches a splintering of one large, collaborative group into competing vindictive ones - resulting in new, angry tribes whose central thesis is to not cooperate.","In the absurd idiocy of identity regressive politics, looting is seen as protest, and protecting one's own property is seen as privilege.","I've done two shows every day for years, but I don't think I could work on just one show a week. I would go crazy, and I would drive everybody nuts. I've got to feel like I'm under pressure.","I don't think Trevor Noah got his job by being a conservative.","I always thought Jon Stewart was an extremely good surgeon with his scalpel. He would have Republicans on who, I guess, were unclear about what Stewart was up to, and while Jon Stewart was being nice, he was building a case for drowning them.","It takes a special, selfless person to make music that accommodates the universal need for mindless escapism - or what I call oblivion.","It's not misogynistic to criticize a legendary female pop singer; it's misogynistic to think a legendary female pop singer can't handle it.","Generally, I don't bother trying to keep up with prolific bands - but Thee Oh Sees demand it.","The bands I like are not obscure at all. Far from it.","My first concert - maybe it was 1979 - was a blur. I'm not sure whether it was Blue Oyster Cult/Cheap Trick/Pat Travers at San Jose Civic Auditorium or The Police/The Knack/Robert Johnson at Berkeley's Zellerbach Auditorium.","I spent my teens in northern California listening to KALX, KUSF, and KFJC, finding people that changed my life.","At a certain point, we need to figure out how to reward those who choose a path that offers, often, almost no reward.","The girls I dated liked or disliked me, whether I weighed 140 or 150; and six-pack abs had no relevance on their love or repulsion.","If you can have a skewed sense of your body, it stands to reason you could develop the same kind of thing about your relationships with others in a social network.","Nothing is ever as bad as it seems. Nor does it ever last as long as you think.","FNM didn't really become one of my favorite all-time bands until after I'd had all their records for a couple of years. And realized I was playing them every day.","'Sol Invictus' works like your basic FNM record: the sequencing is an artful job, hustling you politely through all the gentle, harsh, weird surprises that follow - and then when it's over, you get back on the ride and start over, just like Space Mountain.","Listening to a FNM record is like a visit from a mysterious relative who knows more about your family than you did.","I realize Twitter can be good, providing a video game of creativity for your brain.","Wherever socialism spread, misery followed - and still follows.","Creating a fan base of both fervent feelers and fanboys, Trump magnificently played off many fawning commentator's insecurities - using the deep desire to be liked or noticed by Trump as a method to keep their criticism of him tamped down.","Trump has manufactured the first-ever Celebrity Immunity Bubble - rendering him incapable of offense, no matter whom he offends. It's brilliant.","Work together. Do not purge your allies because of purity.","It may feel good to think you're right. But it's better to allow the possibility that you're wrong.","If America oppresses, why do so many people risk their lives coming here to be oppressed?","The good and bad thing about online trolling: it's not on the street, and it's not on the street! The good: nothing physical erupts; the bad: there are no brakes to stop it.","We are all better served by objectively diagnosing trolls so they can change.","A troll's life is a no-physical-contact existence. You will die alone, as you die daily, online.","Infected by political ideology, if you dare question climate models, your career is done.","Most Americans don't shout their politics, much less blast it from their TVs while serving you fried pickles - that's the Left.","I'm used to the Right being singled out by the entertainers.","Actors seem brave and unpredictable, but they're spontaneous as a tax return.","No one wants a lecture when you're getting a latte. So if you get one without asking, isn't that grounds for some discipline?","How odd that the proponents of free expression think 'free' only applies to them.","Obama was never that bad or that great, and the same is probably going to go for Trump.","I don't care much for Hillary Clinton."],"Greg Iles":["Southern Gothic is alive and well. It's not just a genre, it is a way of life.","The South is the home of 'an eye for an eye.' 'Turning the other cheek'? The South can't see that.","I deal with the human psychology and evil. They are my twin issues.","And I do have one surefire plot I have not and probably never will write because of my fear someone will carry it out.","I have not written a perfect sentence, in the literary sense. It's a lot easier to throw a perfect pass than to write a perfect sentence, if that sentence is meant to perform more than a mechanical function.","'See Spot run!' is a perfect sentence in some ways. But I doubt the critics would say it was.","My mother, a teacher, encouraged me to use my creativity as an actual way to make a living, and my father, a Mississippi physician, did two things. First, he taught me that all human beings should be treated equally because no one is better than anyone else, and he never pressured me to become a doctor.","Some things we must pass over in silence.","Experiences are like hoarded gold. Whenever I dole out a piece of my private suffering, that is when I get letters from all over the world.","Like my best friend, I asked for drums for Christmas, and got them. But when he moved on to guitar, I realized two things: (1) guitar is a much more expressive instrument, (2) way more girls pay attention to guitar players than to drummers.","My father has always been the heart of my Penn Cage novels.","I like taking a character at the most intense moments of their lives and exploring all that in full and then moving on.","My father served as an Army doctor in West Germany in the late '50s and early '60s. As a result, he and my mother - both native southerners - were acutely aware of what had happened during the Holocaust.","My ancestors fought for the Confederacy during the Civil War; I was raised in Natchez, Miss.; I performed in the Confederate Pageant for a decade; I dug ditches and loaded trucks with black men who taught me more than any book ever could; and I graduated from Ole Miss. Anyone who survived that is a de facto expert on the South."],"Greg Ip":["Mr. Soros, the chairman of Soros Fund Management, is best-known as a speculator, philanthropist and political activist. He made a fortune by doing things such as betting against Britain's currency in 1992 and Thailand's in 1997. A Hungarian refugee, he has spent millions to promote democracy and learning in post-Soviet nations.","Football has always been violent. In the early days of the game, they didn't wear hard helmets. They wore soft helmets, which were just designed to protect the ears. In the '40s and '50s they began to introduce hard helmets, which provided much more protection against things like skull fractures.","In the '70s, there were economists who argued that seat belts were causing people to drive faster and kill more pedestrians. But after 15 or 20 years of research, we can now conclude that's actually not true. Seat belts, on net, do make people safer. So, on an evidence-based process, we should have people wear seat belts.","It is probably the case that some regulation of financing will make crises less likely, and I would say higher capital requirements are an almost fail-safe way to make banks safer. But there are a lot of other things that may not be doing that, and so we need to be careful about sort of, like, rushing to one conclusion or another.","We need banks and financiers and entrepreneurs to take risks because that's how economies grow over time.","Low interest rates are usually attributed to low inflation, weak economic growth and super easy monetary policy. But there's another deep-seated factor that doesn't get much attention: demographics.","When people retire, their income drops much more sharply than their consumption. As a result, they stop saving and start drawing down the assets they've acquired during their high-saving years. That could start to put upward pressure on interest rates and downward pressure on stock prices.","Research by James Poterba at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology finds that the wealth of the U.S.'s elderly is highly skewed. About half of retirees have little or no financial wealth when they retire and depend almost entirely on Social Security for their income."],"Greg Kinnear":["When I was a kid, I was obsessed with this idea of opening a restaurant back in Indiana on a little pond.

Buzz is a dangerous thing that I've heard applied to a lot of people that I've since not heard of again.","My family moved - first to Washington, D.C., and then, in the spring of 1975, to Lebanon, where my father worked as a diplomat at the American embassy. My parents were enthusiastic about the move, so my older brother and I felt like we were off to some place kind of cool.","When I look back on my childhood, I think of that short time in Beirut. I know that seeing the city collapse around me forced me to grasp something many people miss: the fragility of peace.","Whenever Hollywood gets involved with real life events, certain liberties have to be taken.","I'm a terrible procrastinator. When we go to the airport, if they're not literally closing the door behind my sweaty, hyperventilating body, I feel I've been there too long.","You learn more about a person from the people around that person than you do from the person themselves. We all have our own ideas of who we are that may or may not be justified, and you can really find out a heck of a lot more accurately from the people around an individual.","I really don't make a concerted effort to try to find a type of role. Maybe I've just done enough of them now where people are like, 'Oh, it's the guy that's in a swirling vortex of despair, send it to Kinnear!' I don't really know, but it does seem to be a recurring theme.","Same job, whether it's comedy or drama. Regardless of the weight of the role, I feel like the job is always kind of the same. Who is this person? What's this guy here, and how is he playing with this thing, and what's he trying to say? And what's the volley with all these other people around him?","There's times when I'll see a show, or something cooking on TV, and think, 'That can really be fun when it's working.' But it's a grind. I did that at NBC, it was five days a week. I was doing 'Talk Soup' and 'Later' at the same time. It's a hard job, more difficult than people realize.","Here's the thing about movies, all movies end up on television. That's their life. Whether you like it or not, I don't care how much money you spend on it, or how big or broad the film is, or who the actors are in it, eventually it's all coming out of the box.","If you're working on a movie, you want it to be projected on the largest tapestry possible, and the sound to be perfect, and for that kind of communal experience of the movies to take place for it.","Audiences don't ever disappoint me, in the sense that movies I feel really good about, they usually feel really good about too.","I went door-to-door selling cable television subscriptions when I was in college. Not to date myself, but cable was just coming on. I had terrible territories, and they would give me $25, if I got somebody to let them come and just put the little cord in their house.","'Little Miss Sunshine' snowballed. It was a tiny movie. We shot it in 30 days, and it was really fun to do, but it was one of those small movies that you don't hold out huge hope for.","I have a very well organized closet.","Cat lovers turn into cat collectors.","In my sophomore year, a kid told me that the secret to getting women is to play really, really hard to get. I followed his advice, and I didn't have so much as a date that year.","A man always looks good in a dark suit.","The tragic element of a character is always intriguing I think.","I have always been interested in the concept of ruin.","Everybody's family has problems.","You don't get to pick your partners in families; you get assigned a seat at the table.","The irony is that you can't use real rain to make movies.","Of course, actors look forward to the day when they can do a big courtroom scene.","Good scripts and interesting stories are hard enough to find.","The automotive corporations, including Ford, I think are in the business of trying to make cars that people will drive.","Talking about corporations - they're so big. There's not a person at a corporation.","I don't consider a lot of actors that I really admire movie stars.","I've always thought Mexico City was incredibly dynamic.","We all have our own ideas of who we are that may or may not be justified, and you can really find out a heck of a lot more accurately from the people around an individual.","There's something in human nature, the trying-to-get-on-with-it quality of people, the struggle to maintain or keep the show going can be exhausting.","I really don't make a concerted effort to try to find a type of role.","Well, I don't know what image people have of me.","It's not easy to tell a story about writers and make that feel like a complete story and an interesting story.","I like complicated characters.","I'm happy to report that everybody whose face I've wanted to punch on Earth has already been punched.","I've never felt like my career has been on fire.","I don't think there's any connection between my journalism career and my film career. They are two totally different mediums and very different skills.","Ultimately, I'm not so sure that, as a person, I'm all that interesting.","We all have to lead double lives, not just celebrities. The face we put on publicly with our jobs and certain situations. I think that's part of the human condition.","I can't not find humor in elements of most parts of life, but at the same time nothing ever seems perpetually funny to me.","There's no harmony in most people in a way, and I'm attracted to it, and I think it makes for good storytelling.","My grandfather had two boys, my uncle had three boys, my dad had me and my two brothers, each of my brothers have had two boys. Then something happened with the chromosomal experiment and suddenly I've got three girls.","I like the classics!","Setting goals can blind you to opportunities. You might be trying to get to point C. When opportunity B comes, you don't even look at it because you're going straight to C.","I've never had a clear road map. When things come along, I benefit.","I was always explaining why my term papers were never on time. I think that's where I got my acting training!"],"Greg Kurstin":["I was in school with Dweezil Zappa, Frank Zappa's son, and we had a band. Only in L.A. could stuff like that happen. We would hang out in Frank Zappa's studio, and we released a single in 1982 on his label. I was 12, and that was the first recording experience I had. To top it off, Eddie Van Halen produced it.","You can't be in a bubble being a producer. You have to keep up on what's happening at all times.","I'm listening to Spotify all the time and pulling in different things. I might find an artist or a song that I like, and I'll pull that into playlists, and then you'll find related artists. But I like an album as a nostalgic thing; I remember buying albums and getting into the whole thing.","I'm still waiting for rock bands to come back, something raw and relevant.","Sia is like no one else I've ever worked with. She comes completely from this non-logical but very emotional place. I could be wrong, but she doesn't really seem to analyse what she's writing. She doesn't really revise it, but goes with that first thing that comes out.","There's a lot of songs and songwriters out there - you have to make something stand out to pitch songs. Sometimes you have to be bold and just try something different. And just stick with it - don't give up if nothing happens.","I left my band on my own, and it took me a long time to find major success again - almost a decade. And everything that didn't happen during that time just motivated me to do better.","I like to write from scratch most of the time, but I like to have a backup plan just in case.","As a songwriter and as a vocalist, Adele is amazing. You have that. But then there's something about her that's just very honest. I feel like so many people across the board can relate to her and who she is. She's just so appealing and very real.","When I was a young teenager, it was all about The Clash for me and that sort of English punk stuff. Then the Clash led me to all these other kinds of music: classic rock, Stevie Wonder, world music, and Brazilian music. I got serious about jazz when I was probably about 14 or 15.","I like to live life and not work every second of the day, and spend time with my family and stuff like that. Balance is very important for me.","I really love headlining. Opening up is fun - getting to play for all these people who might not know you - but it's so much easier sometimes playing for people who know all your songs: you get that instant feedback.","I constantly have little panic attacks of wanting to change something on a production level, but I let go.","Something about a performance - it's in the air, it's in the moment. It never really bothers me when something goes wrong; I think it's kind of funny.","I love Los Angeles, and I've secretly always wanted to do a song about Los Angeles, but it's a hard thing to pull off.","It's really cool to hear your stuff in things like TV shows. It's a pretty cool feeling to hear what you did in the studio and then to hear it in places like that. It's definitely surreal.","I think my signature dance move might be some sort of '80s new wave pogo, which I only break out on very special occasions. It will only last for about three seconds. Then I go back to a very subtle, less-is-more approach.","I try not to force my sound on everybody. I try to yield unto each artist and... I try to just support that sound rather than force a sound that might not fit.","Being in front of the cameras is not my favorite thing to do. But it's a good problem to have."],"Greg Lake":["There is no standing still because time is moving forward.","Making a comeback is one of the most difficult things to do with dignity.","I love touring in the United States. It's dramatically different wherever you go. North to south, you're going from snow to palm trees.","The greatest music is made for love, not for money.","I would like to involve myself in some black music. I would like to do some blues and some gospel music. I want to try stuff from other genres and try to widen my musical base.","I picked up the guitar at 12 yrs old - basically, my mother and father bought it for me for Christmas. I played one at my friend's house; when I say played it, I just played around with it at my friend's house. It just struck me as something I really wanted.","When you play music with someone who has a heart rather than playing with someone who is just doing it for money or is cynical it makes all the difference.","I don't think art is a goal orientated business. I don't do things for the challenges, I only do them because I love them, I'm not really a goal orientated, achiever type of person.","Unless you go forward then you are going back.","The early ELP albums were pioneering in a way.","As I said to Ringo, I was in a successful Rock N Roll band. He was in a band that changed the world. That's the difference.","I feel with ELP that I wasn't making the most of my life and I wasn't making the most of my creativity. I was marking time. I don't want to do that. Life is to short.","Philosophically, what I have learned is to thy own self be true. That is the biggest lesson of all. Relax; music is fun. To many people take it to seriously because of the money involved.","I just got a call one day from Ringo asking me if I wanted to go out on the tour. It was as simple as that. He was putting together this band and he heard of me in the context of doing this and he gave me a call. I jumped at the chance.","When you are in a band for a number of years you loose your identity in a way. You become a part of that band and then all of a sudden you are not part of that band. You are still the band without the other two members.","When we made that album with Gary Moore, I was still kind of searching for the right direction for myself. Although the music is quite good the direction was like a box of fireworks that caught light all at the same time.","Most of my career has been about standing on a stage performing music to an audience, and once the show is over, they go home and I go on to the next show.","It's true when they say songwriting is 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration. In truth, what happens is... songs comes through you.","What I learned then was there is a certain power in a three piece band. The more people you put on that stage, the more diluted it becomes.","The less people that are on the stage, there's more drama. You start living the music with each individual. When you see a band with ten people on stage, just a huge ensemble, you don't know who's doing what.","When I was writing my autobiography, these songs came up from time to time which were important to me, and I realized that what they really represented was, they'd come from this age of shared music.","Progressive music probably wouldn't even really exist if not for the people of the United States having picked up on it and nurtured it in the way they did. It really is an American form of music in the sense that it was nurtured here. So it belongs here. It has become part of the fabric of American musical culture.","You often hear people say 'Luck is self made.' I think it is, to a certain extent; if you work hard on something, you are more likely to be lucky than if you don't. That having been said, I do believe during in my career I have been at the right place at the right time with the right people.","Songs are like children. They are all special to me - you can't just pick a favorite. Of course, 'Lucky Man' was a special tune with a wonderful story behind it. They have all done different things.","I'll have periods when I write and periods when I don't. But you don't want it to become a discipline, really. If it becomes a discipline, it becomes a chore, and that's no good. To make art you need to be inspired.","Music is an emotional experience, and that is what imprints itself on the soul. And I think for me, any great art is art which communicates human emotion.","Certain things you learn through exposure. It's really the elements which make up any artist. You really learn by example. You learn by influence. And some people have a huge impact on you, and that's how you become the artist you are.","I think good music comes from the heart. That's my belief.","'Lucky Man' I wrote when I was twelve years old. I wrote it when I first was given a guitar by my mother. I only knew four chords, but I used them all to write that song. And it just stayed with me, stayed in my head. I didn't even write it on a piece of paper. I remembered it.","Things like 'Lucky Man' were never written to even be a record, let alone a hit record."],"Greg Laswell":["I grew up with the Beatles and they are still to this day my top band played in my iTunes.","I try not to take myself too seriously.","Once you really get into a song, other than just listening to it, it forces you to go 'oh, they did this. I never would have thought of doing that,' when you deconstruct it. It's something you really can't do sometimes when you're just listening to a song. You have to really get into it.","I've always loved doing covers. Some artists don't like covers. Some listeners don't like covers. But I love them. It gives you a new perspective production-wise. It's easier for me, if I'm starting a new record, I like to produce a few songs that aren't mine just so it frees me up not to worry about it so much.","People are doing what they can these days and looking for creative ways to sell music.","At an independent label, you have to figure out inventive ways to promote without spending the money."],"Greg LeMond":["More people should apologize, and more people should accept apologies when sincerely made.","I love downtown Seattle. It's a city that has all of the outdoor activities and is still a very cosmopolitan city.","I'm more optimistic about cycling right now than I've ever been.","You don't suffer, kill yourself and take the risks I take just for money. I love bike racing.","I have always struggled to achieve excellence. One thing that cycling has taught me is that if you can achieve something without a struggle it's not going to be satisfying.","Testing, we will never do enough of it.","Even good people are obliged to deceive.","Sincere apologies are for those that make them, not for those to whom they are made. Sincere apologies are for those that make them, not for those to whom they are made.","Perhaps the single most important element in mastering the techniques and tactics of racing is experience. But once you have the fundamentals, acquiring the experience is a matter of time.","It is cycling as a professional sport that represents the problem. It can transform someone into a liar.","The physical demands of cycling is that it actually lowers your immune system, and you expose yourself to a tremendous amount of elements - so certain people might get a chronic overload and develop, say, bad asthma.","I know too that we Americans like to think of ourselves as cleaner than clean, a healthy nation who would never take anything when a recent poll suggested that 65 per cent of the population would risk dying in 10 years if they would be guaranteed Olympic gold.","I want to tell the world of cycling to please join me in telling Pat McQuaid to resign. I have never seen such an abuse of power in cycling's history - resign, Pat, if you love cycling. Resign even if you hate the sport.","There are few things that you can't do as long as you are willing to apply yourself.","I know it is possible to win the Tour without taking anything.","I know I'll never feel that sensation of racing and winning again and that took a while to get used to. The Tour was a race I never thought I could lose.","I rode in a nine-day charity ride recently, averaged 43km a day and still finished in the lead group. I'm 38, not quite finished yet.","Racing is a very selfish, self-centred, self-glorifying thing. My wife's life for 14 years was centered around me. It was all about me. It was all for my ego.","There are so many people who have died of cycling, and that didn't happen when I was racing.","Seattle is very similar to Minneapolis. I like the culture; I like the people. I raced a bike and won a national championship on Lake Washington in 1977, so I've had a connection there for a long time.","I guess I'm a semi-retired person. I work out of my house. I'm a skier in the winter - downhill and cross country. I have a place in Montana for the down-hilling.","I used to trapshoot. I was actually a junior national champion. My parents are trapshooters, so I'm more into target stuff.","If people really want to clean the sport of cycling up, all you have to do is put your money where your mouth is.","I've always thought that travelling every day as a journalist on the Tour's got to be harder than actually racing."],"Greg Louganis":["I guess you can tease me about being a drama queen, because that did heighten the drama.","The Games are just a nice, positive way to build friendships, camaraderie and, of course, self-esteem. Plus, the Games are a great opportunity for people to participate in sports who normally wouldn't.","I just did not discuss my personal life, my sexuality with the media. That was my policy.","I've learned at the book signings that everyone has obstacles.","In sports, people reach their peak very early. You have to move on. I don't know if I will ever surpass what I did at the Olympics, but I'm still doing the work I always wanted to do.","Mom was the one who taught me unconditional love. With Dad, I'd always felt there was something to live up to - expectations. But in the last year, we had a wonderful relationship.","One of my dogs is in the movie Beethoven's 2nd.","People wait in line to see me, saying there's plenty of living to be done even if you have an HIV diagnosis. People say they are 10- or 15-year survivors and still moving forward.","People who were close to me - family and friends - they knew about my sexuality.","Well, unless you're Wayne Gretzky or Michael Jordan, you need the full support of your team.","When you're a kid growing up, and you think you're gay, you know that you're different; you're often teased and it can really destroy your self-esteem. But sports can be great for building self-esteem."],"Greg Lynn":["What's interesting about architects is, we always have tried to justify beauty by looking to nature, and arguably, beautiful architecture has always been looking at a model of nature.","With everything that I design, from a church to a plate to skyscraper to a spoon. I am always thinking about voluptuous volumes and spaces.","Before computers, you'd start designing using shapes of cubes. Now I can start with something like a handkerchief, an object that doesn't have strong inside and outside boundaries or much closed volume.","It turns out it's not rocket science to design a sacred space.","Without a computer, every point on a structure has to be calculated with reference to everything else. But by using a PC, I can create complex curves that don't have radii or centers.","By supporting all the links in the building chain and giving them an easy, intuitive tool for sharing model-based project information, GTeam enhances workflows and improves communication from design through to fabrication and assembly.","It's most satisfying to have an effect on the public realm - deep down I think it's what every architect wants to do.","When my kids were toddlers, they had all these rotomolded plastic things. My life became surrounded by big, hollow plastic toys - from the scale of playhouses down to rocking horses, and everything in between - which we would then take to the secondhand store. But we'd get sentimentally attached and hate to see them go.","I really like the pop culture materials of everyday life, but used in some way that elevates them to something you notice and care about.","Plastics, as a material, are very nasty, but as an alternative to, let's say, a brick, which seems really natural, they start to look pretty good. They're very low energy to produce, very lightweight to transport and construct. That's why they're so popular.","As sustainability becomes more and more of a concern, we're going to see more plastics.","A very big percentage of small-scale construction is plastic. But it's some horrible beige plastic made to look like wood.","It's incredibly exciting to know people are using and living with the things I create.","The clothes I like are not necessarily tailored.","To go back to architecture, what's organic about architecture as a field, unlike product design, is this whole issue of holism and of monumentality is really our realm. Like, we have to design things which are coherent as a single object, but also break down into small rooms and have an identity of both the big scale and the small scale."],"Greg MacGillivray":["At first, the tornado is nearly invisible. Against the sky, it's white on white.","My goal is that after seeing 'Grand Canyon,' every person in the audience will go home knowing they have to conserve water: even something as simple as installing a low-flow toilet or showerhead, or turning off the faucet while they're brushing their teeth.","Satisfying myself is the point in filmmaking, in my mind.","Not only have I made films about the subject, but I've largely funded them on my own, so I'm fully committed to doing whatever I can to change the audience's respect and appreciation for the ocean. In 100 years I want whales, dolphins and sharks to still be around, and the ocean to be a healthier place.","Marine scientists predict that by 2050 there will be no more large fish left in the ocean if we don't change our relationship with the sea.","We have new tools that can give the audience a sense of not only being there, which is the key element in an IMAX film, but also seeing things in a way that they won't see on television or in feature films.","Flying through a hurricane is the most fearsome shaking you will ever get. Everything has to be tied down in the airplane. And the IMAX camera has to be rock-steady through all this. We had to design special mounts on the left and right sides of the cabin and in the cockpit to hold the cameras.","I love the ocean; growing up around Laguna Beach, I spent my summers surfing, diving, and snorkeling.","I've been using the power of the IMAX medium, with its gigantic screens and supervivid pictures, to get people to fall in love with the ocean.","What's happening on the Colorado River is happening all over the world. The water is overused, overdammed, and it's polluted in some places.","The ocean is our planet's life support system, yet in my travels and at home, I've seen its degradation firsthand.","'Hollywood Don't Surf!' is really about how Hollywood's superficial view of surfing culture has influenced popular culture and the story of what happened when real surfers tried to change that.","In a normal movie, the director controls what you look at. The shots don't last very long because you're getting the audience to look at specific things. An IMAX shot, on the other hand, can be twenty or thirty seconds long.","Grain isn't structured like a screen door that you're looking through, but pixels are. Film-based grain is just all over the place, one frame totally different from the next. So your edges are coolly sharp and have a different feeling, an organic feeling rather than this mechanic feeling you get with digital.","Film has far more color shades. It's called 'bit depth' in digital terms. And most bit depth in digital is about twelve, but film bit depth can be twenty to thirty. And so you just have more shades of yellow and red and oranges and everything.","With digital, you do have the advantage of having an absolutely rock steady image because there's no projector gate, no perforations, no film weaving through a machine. And there's no dust and no scratching."],"Greg Maddux":["The reason I think I'm a good pitcher is I locate my fastball and I change speeds. Period. That's what you do to pitch. That's what pitchers have to do to win games.","I take golf trips with my brother or with friends. We usually go to Pebble or Bandon Dunes. One year we went to Hawaii.","I was under the impression I had signed a three-year contract. I want to be back. I expect to be back. I will be back.","The dirt was OK, but once you hit the grass... Wet grass is slippery.","I don't believe for one second that the eye surgery has helped me on the mound.","I don't care if we're out of it or not, if I've got a chance to pitch, I want to.","I look forward to another good year next year. It would be nice to win, too.","I would love to try to win another game. Obviously, it's more fun when you win. I'd rather try and not win than not try at all.","If they want me I'd love to come back. I'm not going to play because I can, I'm going to play because I deserve it.","I only know one way to pitch. I really do.","I know I don't throw very hard anymore, but I'd like to think I can still hurt a guy who's not looking.","I daydream just like everybody else. I just do it with my body facing the field, so everybody thinks I'm paying attention."],"Greg McHugh":["Socially, I think I'm quite comfortable; I enjoy chatting to people... but I do have my quirks.","I do have very high customer service standards - I'd send back sushi because it's too fishy.","Any opportunity I can get to showcase different characters, I absolutely love.","Most of the meetings I get are in London, and in terms of travelling, I was getting so used to the Virgin train, I knew most of the staff by name.","It's not like there's no work in Scotland, but speak to any actor, and they'll tell you it's limited. So you have to go to London or Manchester to broaden your horizons.","I live in east London, but I'm not cool.","To combine telling an interesting story with brilliantly written characters is the most difficult thing to do.","I went to uni and then drama school afterwards and lived in quite a few student houses."],"Greg Moore":["If you ain't got your black hat, there ain't no use in filling out an application.","Obviously the more pucks you get to the net, the more the percentages go up."],"Greg Mortenson":["I say if you fight terrorism, it's based in fear, but if you promote peace, it's based on hope.","If you look at the 9/11 highjackers, certainly they were educated, some even had university degrees, but nobody really checked their mothers, who were nearly all illiterate.","I decided in '96 to dedicate my life to mostly promoting literacy and education for girls in rural Pakistan and Afghanistan.","Liberals, conservatives, Muslims, Jews, Christians, and I find - I think education is something that can bring us together.","I used to climb mountains a lot; I decided to go to Pakistan to climb K2, the world's second-highest mountain. I didn't get quite to the top.","But what I really believe is education is a key to pretty much everything - prosperity, economics, peace, stability.","Yes, I first visited Korphe village, Braldu valley, Baltistan, Pakistan, after failing to summit K2 in 1993, and met Haji Ali, a long time dear mentor and friend. My second visit to Korphe was in 1994.","Yes, I was detained for eight days in Waziristan in 1996. It was against my will, and my passport and money were taken from me. I was not mistreated or harmed, but I was also not allowed to leave.","The Pathan people of Waziristan are proud people who I greatly admire.","My father ended up starting the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre, which is on the slopes of Kilimanjaro. My mother started a school.","One thing that I noticed is having met some former Taliban is even they, as children, grew up being indoctrinated. They grew up in violence. They grew up in war. They were taught to hate. They were, they grew up in very ignorant cultures where they didn't learn about the outside world.","In 'Three Cups of Tea' I was fairly critical of the military. And I mentioned that they're laptop warriors and there's no boots on the ground. But I can say now that they've gone through a tremendous learning curve.","Once I started the first school, I realized this is what my life is meant to be, is to promote education and help kids go to school, and that's very clear.","Really, what education does is it gives opportunity, but it also gives hope."],"Greg Mottola":["I have a little bit of a pet peeve about how the middle class is depicted in movies. I feel like they tend to be either depicted in a very sentimental way, where everybody has a heart of gold except for the villains you're supposed to hiss at, or there's a sort of indie-style version... When it's done well, it's brilliant, it's 'Blue Velvet.'","It's like I'm thin skinned, I guess, but I thought I could never write about my youth for the longest time. It took getting to my forties before I could even look back on it.","For better or worse, I am as fascinated with human flaws as anything.","I think I am attracted to that time in life when your worldview is still forming in small ways.","I feel like I came from a generation where... We didn't have Vietnam. We didn't have World War II. Nothing cultural was thrust upon us to make men out of us, so you're kind of free to not grow up that way if you don't want to.","I have scripts that I've only shown to animals... and they passed on them.","Some scenes comes together really quickly, and some scenes are disasters that take forever. But it sort of works itself out over time.","I can't seem to escape comedy. Whenever I sit down and try to write something serious, it just doesn't work.","I worry that I would actually hurt my career doing something I didn't enjoy.","I kind of thought I would only work exclusively in the world of naturalistic comedy drama, but there is this side of me that also loves Hollywood, and I wanted to see what that felt like.","When I read a script, I always - the first question I ask myself is, 'Is there something that I could bring to it that maybe the next guy wouldn't?' Because I've read a lot of very good scripts and thought there are people who could do this better than I.","The truth is, good actors are always looking to do something different. They are dying to play slightly odder characters or work on movies that aren't straight down the middle.","I specialize in movies that people say are underrated, with the exception of 'Superbad.'","I have some pride in the things I've done, but I'm pretty hard on myself. Part of looking at my old work is to motivate me to try harder.","To me, it's important to try and make an emotional connection with the audience.","My own personal geek culture years were when I was much younger. I collected comic books up until a certain age. I wanted to be a comic book artist when I was younger.","I'm not someone who's gone to Comic Con as a devotee.","I'm the most awkward man alive.","I certainly did work at an amusement park. In 1985. Wow - I'm in denial about the year. I was in college, and I had no skills.","In indies, life is very dark and realistic, and in mainstream films, the edges are all rounded off and very sentimentalized.","Having grown up in a Catholic family, while I felt like I was never conscious of any blatant anti-Semitism, I was aware of a slightly insidious, us-versus-them mentality. A lot of my best friends and early girlfriends were Jewish, and I encountered what was more of a suburban small-mindedness, of people needing to defend their tribe.","The joke is that no matter how much we think we can evolve, we'll never escape our limitations.","I worked for seven years doing computer graphics to pay my way through graduate school - I have no romance with computer work. There's no amount of phony graphics and things making sound effects on the screen that can change that.","I have a long love of fantasy and science-fiction.","I'd like to think I have a strange affinity for the embarrassing. Not sure what that says about me. But I like the awkward, uncomfortable comedy.","I remember on my very first film, which Steven Soderberg executive-produced, he said, 'Try not to repeat yourself. Do things that scare you.' Even if it's a challenge, I want people to say that this guy tried this thing. Hopefully he learned from it.","The Holy Grail audience are young people and, at the end of the day, that's who gets courted.","I have alopecia. My hair fell out when I was in college and I didn't take it so well.","When you're a young person, the solace one can get from popular music is something I just have tremendous nostalgia for, affection for. I still have it.","'Duel' is one of the greatest suspense films of all time.","'Sugarland Express' is a movie that I really loved and watched a lot.","My first-ever job in the movie business, I was an art student at Carnegie Mellon, and they were shooting the movie 'Gung Ho' in Pittsburgh, and I worked as an extra for a few days. Michael Keaton bumped into me in one scene, and it's in the movie. And I worshipped him.","I had always thought my fantasy career would be making indie films and doing my own thing. But then 'Superbad' came along, and it totally changed everything. It was so hilarious and smart and extreme; you could probably do a psychoanalysis term paper on the male sexual psyche going on there.","When I first saw 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High,' I thought: That's what my life is like. That's my day-to-day.","I don't like high concept movies very much, and the kind of scripts that I would occasionally get offered tended to be really high concept comedies or romantic comedies. I just don't like it. I like much more realistic movies with actual psychology and behavior in them.","The crazy thing about independent filmmaking is that you're so judged on your first film. It almost needs to be one of those groundbreaking 'I've-never-seen-that-before'-type movies.","I like writing, but it really can be a struggle for me.","Film school didn't prepare me for the fact that you have to manage so many different personalities at every stage, and I learned nothing about what to do when a movie was finished."],"Greg Norman":["To me I've just really, really found a relaxed, peaceful side of my life and I'm enjoying it.","I mean, I can actually say goodbye to the game of golf, never hit another golf shot the rest of my life and I'd be happy because I can get back in life without any rotation.","I've really got no complaints about the way I played, just extremely frustrating with the putter and I'm sure there's a lot of other players saying the same thing except the guy who's going to win the golf tournament.","What's a good tournament for him? Winning it. He's good enough.","When you see that many people with a smile on their face, then you must be doing something right.","I owe a lot to my parents, especially by mother and my father.","I always wanted to be the best I could be at whatever I did. I didn't want to be the number one golfer in the world. I just wanted to be as good as I could be. I work hard, I push myself hard, and I probably even expect too much of myself.","The players have competed on the level the last 25 or 30 years are always going to be the players that compete at a high level. These guys practice hard, they work on their game, they still hit the ball extremely well.","Well, I think any national championship is an extremely important championship to play in.","I think it's great the opportunity is given to all of us really to come out and play major championships after the real major championships have gone beyond us.","Obviously it's my second senior event, and I'm tired obviously coming back from the British Open, from surgery, which was priority No. 1, did that successfully, and each week since the British Open I've felt in pretty good control of my golf game.","That's why we have practice rounds. We make the adjustments as we go around, try and find out how to play the golf course the best we can. No big deal, it's nothing to me, it's the same for me as it is to everybody and we're all trying to understand it.","I don't see myself playing or adjusting my schedule for senior tournament golf.","You know, like I said, I'm not going to adjust my Senior Tour schedule.","I'm not interested at all in playing more than 12, 15 tournaments a year on an annual basis because like all the old guys out here on this Tour, we've played golf for nearly 30 years of our lives.","Being away for the weekends, and me being the international player that I have been for those 30 years, I've spent a lot more time flying around the world, playing different golf tournaments around the world.","People in this room must have back problems, I'm sure some of us do, and it is really, really one of the worst pains and debilitating parts of your body that you can actually have because you really can't do anything in your life when you have it.","When I turned 50, I said to myself, well, if this is what it's like turning 50, I can't wait to turn 60 because I still felt very, very mentally and physically good, outside my back surgery.","My doctor asked me how many golf balls I had hit in my career. I'm lying there in bed calculating somewhere between four and five million golf balls I had hit to do that on my body.","I wouldn't call it bitter. I think it's just sweet. I've always believed my life seems like it's gotten better and better as each decade has gone by. So I don't see any I don't see any bitterness about it.","So my game is solid. So that obviously makes me feel confident, that like anybody else in this field, you name them, I feel like I've got the ability to win the golf tournament just as much as they have, and that's the way I'm going to take it.","The game of golf doesn't come rushing back to you. Last week I made a couple of fundamental mistakes that I probably wouldn't have made in the heat of the battle back when I was in my heyday, and those things have got to come back.","On 18 you've got to drive it up a gnat's ass."],"Greg Poehler":["It's interesting because Swedes subtitle everything, so they're so used to it. When my wife watches a show with subtitles, she has a skill to be able to watch and read. Whereas I'm more of a read or watch.","If you take my own life, the longer you stay in a country, you almost lose your former self and become this third-party person who is caught in between two worlds.","I didn't really watch 'Dallas,' so I wasn't as wowed by the idea of Patrick Duffy as Swedes were 'cause he's, like, the most famous guy in all of Sweden.","In my whole life, when I've watched TV and movies, I've almost always felt, 'I could do that better,' and I thought everyone felt that way.","When you're a litigator, you write so much, so many briefs, over and over again, that you're kind of really focused on one document and have draft after draft, and really pay attention to every single word.","I met my wife in New York, so, we lived together there for five years, so my Swedish was kind of a gradual learning process.","I feel like the longer I hold out - I feel like as soon I move to L.A., I just become one of a million.","If you only get one roller-coaster ride, you don't want to be thinking about the second one when you're on it.","You don't take food home from restaurants in Sweden.","I was a lawyer for 12 years in New York and Sweden.","My philosophy on love is that if it is The One, whatever the circumstances are, you'll figure it out. There's nothing too difficult to overcome.","Acting is always something I thought I could do, and I thought I would be pretty good at it, but I thought that I missed the opportunity, that it was too late.","I created, wrote, produced, and starred in my first-ever acting gig!","I speak Swedish mainly with my kids' friends.","It's funny, I lived my first 38 years of my life with maybe one or two people ever saying that I looked like Greg Kinnear. As soon as I get into the entertainment industry, now it's 100 percent of people."],"Greg Rucka":["I love doing research. It's like cheating, but with permission.","I've always had a thing for theme parks and their less-glorious cousins, amusement parks, the carnival midway, and others of such ilk.","Some of the best moments I've ever written have come about because someone, somewhere, blew my preconceptions out of the water and dropped a detail in passing that took the work in an entirely new, entirely unexpected, direction.","Emotional honesty transcends reality; it's what allows disbelief to be suspended and yet what makes a story stay true.","'Alpha' is a very fast-moving book. It doesn't lend itself to laborious introspection and the navel-gazing that some stories can fall prey to.","When there's a clear vision, and you've got the creative teams working toward that goal, each on their own, it can then come together quite elegantly at the endpoint.","Heroes are defined by their villains - Batman is nothing if he doesn't have Two-Face.","A character wandering around asking, 'Who am I?' isn't, in and of itself, a story I'm interested in telling.","Like nightclubs and sporting events, entry into an amusement park is a permission to become someone else. We come for the experience and to relish it.","I love 'The Omen,' just as a piece of plotting.","Fear is one of the elements of nonlethal weaponry. You're going to get hurt, and you don't want to get hurt. Pepper spray hurts. You don't want to be sprayed. That's why it's a useful deterrent as a nonlethal weapon - I'm not advocating spraying people randomly.","The goal of 'Revelations' is that once it's all done and finished, and you've read all of it, it is its own story.","The goal with 'Alpha' was to run towards the cliches and then to break through them, and that doesn't change depending on the medium.","I think if you look back at some of the stuff that we broadly label as the crime 'ouvre,' there are certainly elements of the supernatural at work.","I'm not a huge Lovecraft fan as far as that goes; I think there are some stories of his that are really quite wonderful, but for the most part, I have great difficulties with his prose - and the more you know about the man, the harder it is to separate him from the work in many ways.","What we want to see is stories that are going to be honest stories about the characters that we're telling them about.","I showed up pretty much at the exact right moment to end up with a lot of work on my plate very quickly, because I was young and foolish, and so I wrote very quickly.","All the sudden, I was part of the 'No Man's Land' thing, and there was a bundle of core writers for that, but somewhere along the line, I became the go-to guy after that initial arc.","I think there are certain questions that get asked in comics over and over again, and people want definitive answers, but I feel like there shouldn't be definitive answers.","There are so many great characters because one of the things that makes Batman fantastic is that Batman is tragic. I've said this elsewhere; I've said it over and over again, but the beauty of the character is that he's a Don Quixote.","We wanted to talk about death in the DC Universe, and how some people go to get a pass and come back, and some people didn't. That opened up a whole other topic about legacy. We wanted to talk about what was required to be a hero, what were the elements of true heroism?","I think that Batman loses his efficacy and mythology if he's got too many people around him. That's what the Justice League is for, you know what I mean?","I think Batman has the Wolverine problem. I think he's overexposed.","You have to accept that Batman is a fact of life in Gotham City, and on top of that, you have to accept that somehow this city manages to function with a police force that's 90% corrupt.","I like the 'Keystone Kops' storyline. It didn't actually go quite the way I wanted to, but it was another great way to show how different life was in these two different corners of the DCU, being on the ground in these different areas.","There is a sequence in my 'Detective Comics' run where you can't find consecutive issues by the same artist. That's intentional. That was done on purpose.","I am the product of Denny O'Neil in many ways, I carry forth a lot of what Denny instilled in me.","You know how a nonlethal weapon is supposed to work? A nonlethal weapon works on the basis of three things: It needs to deter, and that's normally done through pain, and that pain creates a byproduct, which is fear.","There are a lot of people in the medium who came and got into the industry and work in the industry, and these are people who were raised on comics and loved comics. Comics are their religion. To such an extent, that they don't know anything else.","Your ability to name every single variation of Kryptonite and every first issue in which it appears is a great pop quiz skill, but is not a great writing skill, all right? So just because you can do that doesn't mean you know how to write.","I come from a prose background. I come from short story background, and that led me into novels.","The first story I can remember writing, that I truly set down on paper, was a Christmas story that I wrote when I was ten years old.","When I was in high school, I started writing a serial novel, longhand, set in the Arthurian mythos, and influenced not incidentally by Marion Zimmer Bradley's 'The Mists of Avalon.'","I write characters. Some of those characters are women.","We seek to craft characters who inspire empathy: characters our audience will care for and, as a result, will care about what happens to them and thus will share the journey we have charted. A story, after all, is the character's journey.","I tend to see - socially, I don't tend to be myself in a male role. I don't know any other way to put it.","I'm a Caucasian American Jew. These are all things that make up who I am.","Character is made up of a variety of different things. One of those elements is gender.","The worst thing that can happen for a writer is for a writer to start believing their own press. I think the industry, and the comics industry in particular, is littered with the bodies of writers who believed their own press. And you can see the moment they did, and then the work nosedives.","The writer's curse is that the more you fall in love with the work you're doing, the more I think it shows.","I do crazy amounts of research. I want this stuff to 'work,' so to speak. I need to be, at least to me, believable - because if I feel - if I cannot invest some element of verisimilitude, the reader is absolutely not going to buy in.","It's funny because you know the novel process: you get the drafts, you get the galley, and then you get the galley proofs. You have opportunities to change things all along. But the further along in the process you go, the more careful you have to be in making those changes, and the smaller the changes have to be.","When I was in third grade, I would run home - literally run home from school - and if I could make it in time, I could get home and the put the TV on in time to catch the answering machine message at the start of 'The Rockford Files.'","When I started out as a novelist, I thought I was going to be a private-eye writer. That was my intent, and that's what I studied, I mean, scholarly.","My college senior thesis was going to be on the American private investigator.","I love liminal characters. I love these characters that are outside and enter and consequently are perpetually outsiders, and who hold themselves to a higher standard.","When we're 16, we have lots of heavy thoughts. And these are the heavy thoughts, where, when we're in our 30s, we look at 16-year olds and sort of scorn it.","Speaking as a father, there is no rulebook, and you don't know how to do it. You just do the best you can.","Comics fans want new stuff that looks exactly like the old stuff. It is hard for the publishers, and even the audience, to change something.","Every character needs an adversary - one who is both challenging and a contrast for the hero. The best adversaries reveal something about the character they're contrasting.","Punisher is scary; he should be scary.","To me, the joy you're going to get in a 'Punisher' story is watching him punish incredibly wicked people. Now, if you can add to that an emotional content, wonderful.","Every writer is going to end up drawing from their own experiences in one way or another.","We forget when we're all grown up. 16 was a long time ago. It's hard to remember how freakin' difficult it is as 16! Life is not easy, and you're trying to figure stuff out.","The stories that are out and the things that have been published are a sample of my interests. There are genres and sub-genres that I haven't waded into but have wanted to, or have waded into in other places but never actually written.","There was a time in my career when my hackles would really get raised if someone came in and said, 'We need you to do this or that.' But the fact of the matter is, you're working in a shared universe, and all elements of the universe are, ideally, going to mesh and work together. That's my goal. I want to be on the team.","For me, plot always comes out of character, so I had to be sure of my characters.","I think you can't repeat beats. If you're doing something in one book, you can't do the exact same thing in another book.","Every writer has characters that they become attached to and that they feel very strongly about.","There are still plenty of people who want to burn me at the stake for my Wonder Woman run. And I can't really blame them, you know? That was my take on the character, and when people are invested in the characters, they see them very clearly and in the way they like.","I'm sick to death of the way the Big Two treat people.","For every person who passes on the opportunity to write Spider-Man or Superman, I guarantee there are 5000 hungry writers who would give their eye-teeth to do it. But just because they want to do it, it doesn't mean they are capable of doing it.","DC are playing catch up with Marvel because of things like 'The Avengers' breaking six hundred million domestic.","I think when you're working with a character that another writer is acting as - for lack of a better word - custodian of, your obligation as a professional is to not do anything that violates that 'primary' take.","I met one of my best resources because I cold-called the local FBI office one day early in my career with questions. The agent who took the call knew someone who knew someone who was ex-Army, trained in personal protection. The resulting introduction was one of the best, most enduring friendships I've ever enjoyed.","Good fiction can both entertain and light up those dark corners where nice people don't want to go.","Superman is precisely what we should be teaching our children. Superman inspires us to our best.","I just know that if you make a Superman movie you can't take kids to, you've done something wrong.","If Portland can truly have a true comics show that doesn't become a media show but retains its focus on comics, I think it's going to serve the city well. If this becomes a big show, it's going to bring in a lot of money for the city.","Comics don't work without the visuals, obviously.","If someone arrives, fully functional yet a tabula rasa, how does their environment influence, educate, even mold them? And if that is a nurture question, then where does that character's nature fit in? How does that manifest?","I'm a fan of genre in the abstract, but at best, perhaps all we can really say when we talk about genre is that we're talking about an umbrella that covers a kind of story with certain elements."],"Greg Rusedski":["It's about you. If you win, it's you; if you lose, it's you. Black and white. Nowhere to hide.","What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.","You win any which way you can. You do what you have to do to get by. That's the way it works in any job.","When you're young, you don't know what you don't know, so it's easier to get into that magical thing.","The downside isn't really injury, fear of injury or the process of fighting back from injury. The downside, the very worst thing in the world, is surgery.","You do it for the highs, when you're totally engrossed and everything's flowing and whatever you want, you get. It's like magic. That's why you play the game. That's what it's for. That's why you work.","You can't really describe how difficult it is to deal with. It is any athlete's worst nightmare to be accused of cheating by taking drugs. It really is very difficult to put into words how it makes you feel.","The only way to get back the confidence is to play and win matches. You can practise as much as you like, but you need confidence that comes from playing and winning matches.","It's not a break until you hold your serve.","I'm happy in retirement.","It is a big adjustment but I've always loved that old saying of Jack Nicklaus: 'I retired from golf to go to work.' That sums it up for me.","I don't read all the newspapers.","If I stay healthy and I'm playing good tennis I have as good a chance as anybody.","My biggest problem will be lack of match toughness but I am a positive, optimistic person.","I'm really looking forward to getting back and winning some matches but I'm not thinking about the U.S. Open yet, just getting through my first match."],"Greg Rutherford":["I live in a beautiful village in the middle of the countryside, and being able to disappear off on my bike for a couple of hours two or three times a week is a wonderful way to relax.","My entire life, I've been searching for acceptance.","I eat a lot of vegetables and salad. I put strawberries, pomegranate seeds, blackberries, and blueberries into shakes and add Greek yoghurt for a snack. I have this when I'm not training.","Running up a steep hill or up steps are fantastic ways of building explosive strength.","I'm a very keen baker; I pride myself on my cakes. I go along the classic sponge line, but I like to jazz it up: I've made some psychedelic birthday cakes.","It's all about proving it on the track and proving to people that have different views wrong.","I think the first time baby recognises me and smiles is going to be one of the most amazing times of my life, to be honest.","The type of IBS I am prone to is the constipation type, where I get trapped wind and can get sharp painful spasms in my intestines as well as having sluggish bowels.","If you look at the skeleton, the start is very important.","As a jumper, I try to defy gravity as long as I can. But no matter how far I jump, I'll always hit the earth eventually.","People forget that track and field is one of the hardest sports because we compete against all the world. There are many sports when you are up against only 15 or 20 countries.","My dad is a builder, and my mum's a nurse. They're just very normal people.","To put up with me, you have to be patient.","My parents were great at making sure I got out of bed when I needed to play football on a Sunday morning and that I was ready after school to go to training on a Tuesday and Thursday. But it was never forced upon me or rammed down my throat. If it had been, I could have ended up hating sport.","I thought I was going to jump further than that, but I don't care - I'm Olympic champion.","I was always the slightly fat kid, which used to bother me quite a bit.","It was when my American coach Dan Pfaff came over from the States in 2009 and started working with me that we really began to look at my diet. He decided I was eating too many carbohydrates, so I cut back on bread. Over the next year I lost weight and became leaner.","I have been in discussions with the BBC regarding my involvement with SPOTY after hearing what I believe to be very outdated and derogatory comments from a fellow SPOTY nominee.","For a long time, I thought I'd be a physio if I wasn't a sportsman. At one point, I wanted to be an inventor, and I'd come up with little schemes.","Me and my brother just used to fight all the time; then my sister came along, and it was all about the little girl in the house. We'd always eat dinner together as a family.","I train six days a week.","I always start the day with a protein shake: protein powder mixed with water, peanut butter, and yoghurt to thicken it up.","Jumping isn't as important to my training as you might think; I'm only in the sandpit once a week. There's a high risk factor of injury doing it, so instead, I rely on my progress in the gym to judge how far I'll jump on the big day.","When at home in Buckinghamshire, I tend to work out for two to three hours on the track or in the woods close by and then do weights.","Fruit is carb-based, and I limit carbs when training hard.","I take magnesium to prevent cramps. A few years back, I suffered from hamstring tears, and part of that can be to do with muscle cramping, and then pushing the muscle at that point. I also take a fish oil supplement.","I do a lot of things like running hills and larger amounts of reps in the gym.","The DNA showed I have a level of endurance in me which I never really realised, which makes sense.","My favourite series of all time has been 'Band of Brothers.' That was amazing; I've watched that so many times.","I'm a bit of a history goon, and I love all that. Anything that's medieval-based up until, probably, the Tudor period and just after, I'm quite into.","Even though arguably I could have done much better at school, I'd decided at a young age that I was going to be a professional sportsman at some sport. And at that stage, there was a bit of luck: I was fortunate to meet the right people at the right time to get me to where I am now.","I drive relatively fast - within the remits of the law, obviously - but I struggle with people who do stupid things on the road. I have a massive urge to shout expletives at them.","I want to jump far all the time and go out there and win medals.","I come into these competitions to win, not to get silver or bronze, so it is frustrating.","Athletics set the right sentiment for a clean and believable sport.","I'm excited by going 85 mph, head-first, down an ice track.","If you put me against most sprinters in the world, I reckon over a start I could get very close, if not take them.","I am pleased I went from fourth back into a medal position, but bronze is not good enough for me.","All I can do is turn up and compete.","If other people have problems with my competitions, then there's nothing I can do.","I'm never happy to settle.","It would be pretty special if I could win two Olympic gold medals, one at the Summer Games and one from the Winters, so I'm going to give it a real go.","If the room falls silent for a moment, all I hear is white noise.","During your career, you put yourself in peak physical condition, but then you bear the brunt of it for the rest of your life.","I don't think there are many long jumpers who can say they have jumped so hard that have lost their hearing.","Hopefully, I can get multiple distances out there and re-establish myself as one of the best jumpers in the world.","Adrenaline is an incredible thing.","I am the Olympic, World, Commonwealth, and European champion now, and I hope that's enough for people to accept that I am a half-decent British athlete.","Ultimately, you've got to answer your critics on the track, and I am very much hoping 8.41m is acceptable for people.","I'm very driven, and there are lots of things I can't do.","Ultimately, I'm enjoying what I'm doing.","My team are incredible, and I have the most amazing parents and beautiful girlfriend in the world.","If I win the Olympics in Rio, then I'll have each title in double.","I now have five major titles, and not many athletes can say that.","Although 8.25 isn't very big, it's good to be the best of Europe again.","I can't tell you how much everyone has worked so hard for me, as well as myself.","I knew I was going to be a sportsman.","When I picked athletics, I knew I wanted to be an Olympic champion.","I was quite lucky: although my dad worked a lot, whenever he was free, he would play sports with me and my brother, and I can't wait to do that with my child.","My grandfather died before I was born, so I never had the chance to speak with him about his father. But I learned about him from books.","I dabbled in football myself until the age of 14, but I didn't have as much love for the sport as I did track and field. I would never have been good enough to take it to the highest level.","There's definitely football in the blood, but my body made my decision for me that I was going to be an Olympic athlete instead.","I haven't actually checked my family tree, but Rutherford is a very old Scottish name, so I've probably got Scottish genes a few generations back.","Ultimately, I love the sport; I love doing what I do.","There are not many people around the world who can say, 'I get paid to jump into a sandpit.'","I've not received any major sponsorship deals or anything else.","Being in a scenario where you're thinking, 'I can't do what I want to do due to the financial burden that comes with some of it,' makes you think, 'Well, I could go and do an after-dinner speech every night.' I'd probably earn more than I could in track-and-field. But that's a dangerous scenario to get yourself into.","It's quite funny because I always talk to baby through Susie's belly, and every time I start speaking, I just get kicked in the face.","It will be good fun finding out what sport baby's good at; perhaps it will be something obscure. My parents were fantastic at taking me to training sessions and letting me try lots of different sports, so I want to do the same.","Since the Olympics in London, people say, 'Greg's won again. That's what we all expect. Of course he wins.'","It's changed from one-hit wonder to 'Greg Rutherford wins events.' That's what I've always wanted, that level of recognition.","It's very hard to win anything in athletics.","I think it was just me who thought I could be Olympic champion. I've been telling myself that, and I did that.","I want to become double Olympic champion, triple Olympic champion, five-time world medallist.","When I chose athletics, I knew I wanted to be Olympic champion, and now I have done it in London.","I've got two chocolate labradors, Murphy and Dexter. They're like my children.","I was very into football in my early teens and spent six months with Aston Villa, but I never really got further than having trials. I'm also into ice hockey.","I would love to be an historian. I'm a bit of a history geek and love books and programmes on the subject.","I was persuaded to see 'The Muppets' by a friend, and I regretted it. A very boring hour and a half.","People assume that you need to run fast to get to optimum fitness, but the truth is endurance lifting makes you stronger and leaner.","I do weights three or four times a week, and it has had an incredible impact on my confidence.","I have a real passion for anything medieval, which is why I love the drama series 'Game Of Thrones.'","Over the years, I've had torrid luck with things going wrong.","Ultimately the clothing company is a large investment on my part, and I'm taking a huge gamble. But having a focus away from the track is good for you.","I've had 30 hamstring tears.","Lolo Jones came up to me and said, 'Well done, Greg,' and I don't think I've ever spoken to her in my life.","I've never had a car sponsor or all the things that most others seemed to have had.","I think there are lot more lows in an athletes career than the highs, but you've got to be bale to take them on the chin.","I seem to be the 'luckiest' athlete around - and that's one of the most frustrating things. You compete against a vast array of people and train your whole life for those moments.","I wasn't jumping like Carl Lewis, but I still won an Olympic title.","Even before I really started, no one said I would make it. But I always had belief.","I take my three dogs for long walks every day, and I use that time to talk myself through winning every major competition.","I was that ginger kid who always wanted people to like him. It's hard, and you've got a big chip on your shoulder for a long time."],"Greg Tiernan":["I loved working on 'Thomas & Friends.' That's an iconic show, and that thing is, like, a billion-dollar property. But content-wise, yep, if you're not into steam trains and preschool storytelling, it can get a little wearing after years of it.","The industry sees animation as a genre rather than a medium. It has been pigeonholed into being just for kids' entertainment, and that's it."],"Greg Walden":["As the GAO report recognizes, the long-term health of our forests relies on additional fuel reduction options and funding to reduce the risks that catastrophic fire poses to our nation's ecosystems, communities and federal budgetary resources.","The war on meth must be fought with a multi-pronged approach.","We are taking steps to fight the production of meth on our own soil through limiting access to precursor ingredients, supporting educational efforts and providing necessary resources to law enforcement.","Large corporations and unions know the power of being big enough to bargain for better rates.","Small businesses are seeing huge rate increases every year, and more and more of them are saying they just can't afford to provide coverage. That's part of the reason more than 45 million Americans are now uninsured.","We also have to stop the flow of precursor chemicals that meth cooks use to boil up this poison.","I came away from the forums with a profound concern about the highly addictive and destructive nature of methamphetamine. Families are torn apart, lives are destroyed and treatment is difficult to get.","Operation Northern Star with Canada has made significant progress in battling meth from the north, and we are engaged in numerous training opportunities in Mexico to help curb the problem from the south.","Whether fuel cell system development in central Oregon, wind power generation along the Columbia Gorge, or geothermal energy in southern Oregon, investing in new energy sources makes America more energy independent while creating good paying, environmentally friendly jobs.","With the increasing demand for oil around the world and the rising costs in Oregon and throughout the nation, we must focus on the development of alternate energy sources, especially those that are clean, efficient and renewable.","As federal lawmakers, we have a responsibility to set a precedent for energy efficient practices.","A man of strength and wisdom, John Paul became an inspiration to generations of both Catholics and non-Catholics throughout the world by encouraging freedom, promoting peace and respecting all faiths.","It is no secret that those of us in the Northwest believe the Administration's proposal to drive up the cost of electricity in our region is not only misguided, but also will not achieve the intended goal of raising money for the treasury.","A $1.7 billion average increase in electricity costs is estimated to result in a $1.3 billion decrease in personal income and a loss of 13,000 more jobs in the region.","Since 2000, we've seen base power rates rise by 50%.","I did not come to Washington to raise the electricity rates by as much as $40 per month as this plan would do.","I came here to help make America more competitive and prosperous by developing an energy policy that increases conservation, promotes cleaner technologies, encourages development of renewables and enhances domestic production of gas and oil.","I am maintaining my schedule of commuting to Washington, D.C. each week from Oregon so that I can spend my weekends and days when we are not in session traveling to communities throughout my district.","Many individual growers now are growing organic fruit, and many are taking it upon themselves to market their own products to the public, as opposed to necessarily going through big processors, although, obviously, the bulk of the fruit still is dealt with that way.","I've experienced first-hand the wonderful work organizations like J Bar J do for young people in Central Oregon and I am encouraged that the federal government is taking an active role in the Cascade Youth and Family Center.","The Round-Up is a wonderful community celebration, and I greatly enjoy the chance to visit with residents and see so many families enjoying the festivities offered throughout the week.","Removing substantial fuel loads from our forests helps prevent catastrophic fire and better protects species, watersheds and neighboring communities that call them home.","As a lifelong Oregonian, I prefer our forests green, not black.","It is up to us as lawmakers to provide the resources and streamlined processes that will enable our federal forest managers to become the best possible steward of our lands."],"Greg Wise":["I've built a tree house; because of my architectural training, it's heavily over-designed, with an oriel window sticking out of it and flying foxes coming off it.","Parties are not my thing; I keep it low-key.","In Scotland, I have a huge barn full of woodworking tools. I love working with my hands. I basically just make myself bleed a lot. I'm very accident-prone.","I'm very interested in poo. We don't have a very good relationship with poo, and we should have.","I'm best when I'm feral, when I don't wash or shave or change my trousers for a couple of weeks.","The last thing I want to do is get togged up, go out and be polite.","Any woman knows that it takes two people to be a good parent.","I don't have any labels for myself, really. Sometimes, when I am out with my wife, I am just Mr. Thompson. Or at my daughter's school, I'm Gaia's dad. I don't think of myself as Greg Wise, actor.","I'm a trained architect. Both my parents were architects.","I owe it to those around me to keep sane. We all do.","Acting is not my primary drive in life, although I'd be a very unhealthy person without it.","Very few of us playing a murderer will actually have killed someone.","It's good to explore your darkness.","I'm terribly bad at lying in real life. I flush, look away, do the scratching of the nose, or whatever.","I don't see the point in marriage: if you make a commitment, you make a commitment. Fidelity is important to me; it's about honouring that commitment.","As an actor, you have to understand how you are seen and then play with that. Otherwise, my looks are not important.","The nuclear family doesn't work. It's very destructive; it grew out of selfishness.","Life is about now - some things are just too important to miss.","I think you must be running away from something pretty enormous if you don't want to see a person more than once or twice. I think relationships don't get interesting for quite a while. When the initial heady rush fades, that's when it gets really exciting.","My first heartbreak was extreme. I went to Australia for 10 months when I was at school and told the girl I was madly in love with not to come out to see me - and of course, when I came back, she met me at the airport to tell me she'd met someone else.","I don't think women have ever thrown themselves at me, although I'm quite naive about these things, or was when I was available.","I am a better listener than talker - but that's partly because I believe rows are often caused by saying things you haven't thought through properly.","I used to work as a tour guide for Americans. I'm convinced that even after four weeks on the road they had no idea where they had been. They were in a bubble.","I've spent quite a bit of time in East Africa.","As a teenager, I used to travel everywhere with my guitar. I appreciated the fact it was with me, but it was always an absolute pain to carry around - even though, in those days, you could take in on a plane as hand luggage.","I am starting to hate airports and the whole business of getting onto the plane. It all takes so long I want to scream."],"Greg van Eekhout":["'California Bones' is the first volume in my trilogy about Daniel Blackland, a wizard trying to survive in a world that eats wizards. It's a book about friends and family, trust and betrayal, the love of power and the power of love.","In high school, I stole a six-foot submarine sandwich from a banquet room in front of several hundred people. I did it because I was in marching band, and we were promised food if we played, and they broke their promise. It was my first and only heist, motivated by justice and hunger.","I grew up in Los Angeles, and I was always fascinated by the La Brea Tar Pits. Right in the middle of the city, in an area called the Miracle Mile, for crying out loud, we have these eldritch ponds of dark, bubbling goo. And down in the muck, there're all these amazing fossils: mammoth and saber tooth cat and dire wolf.","Being part of the original 'Star Wars' generation, I have always known a dark future.","If 'Star Wars' wasn't enough to prepare me for a dark future, there was the 'Planet of the Apes' franchise, conveniently repeated for me in Los Angeles on KABC's Channel Seven 3:30 movie. Apes enslaving humans! Mutants with boils and an atom bomb! Ape riots in Century City! They killed baby Caesar's parents!","As a kid, I didn't need to be convinced the future promised peril and oppression, so when I started thinking up the middle-grade science fiction novel that became 'The Boy at the End of the World,' it seemed only natural to build the story around a dark vision of the future. In my book, civilization has nearly destroyed itself.","As a reader, I tend not to get too much from tales of unrelenting grimness.","Back in 1982, when there were still only a manageable number of 'X-Men' titles on the racks (by which I mean just one), Marvel quite reasonably figured the world could stand another team of beleaguered mutant superheroes. And so were born 'The New Mutants,' junior X-Men whose powers had just begun to manifest at the onset of puberty.","I don't think that eating bones is necessarily gruesome unless you're a vegetarian.","I try to eat vegetarian, though I'm not very good at it, and it's a work in progress. But we basically are what we eat. Eat fat, and there's fat in your body. Eat protein, and there's protein in your body. Eat magic, and there's magic in your body.","There's a certain amount of world-building that I hold off on until I need it for the story. World building in advance isn't really my thing, maybe because I didn't grow up playing RPG's.","In everything I write, I'm always striving to hit the right mix of light and darkness, humor and pain, fun and seriousness.","More than working toward the book's climax, I work toward the denouement. As a reader and a writer, that's where I find the real satisfaction.","I feel lucky that my career so far has included books for adults and books for kids. They're equally important to me, and I hope I get to continue writing both.","I think there's only one reason to write in any genre or to any particular age group: You are called to it. You think it'd be fun.","Middle grade fiction, to me, is really about emergence of self. It's about expressing the idea that the world is going to start affecting you more, and your parents' influence is going to wane. Middle grade is when a lot of kids discover their passions - art, music, sports, what have you.","The stakes in my books tend to be kind of ridiculously high. In 'Kid vs. Squid,' the question is whether or not the California coast will be subsumed by the ocean in favor of the creation of a new Atlantis. In 'The Boy at the End of the World,' what's at stake is the survival of the human species.","It's possible I'm a weird person, you know, and if I could only write for people who are like me, I wouldn't have any audience at all. Ultimately, I'm my audience. I'm writing stories for myself. I don't have kids of my own, and I don't hang around kids all that much. Maybe that puts me at a disadvantage.","At a certain point in the writing of any book, you become absolutely certain that it's terrible and is only getting more terrible with every word you write. This is normal. You just have to keep going, push your way through, and have faith that, through practice and experience and determination, you will get to the end."],"Gregg Allman":["Before I got into rock n' roll, I was going to be a dentist.","I said, other people can write songs, let's see if I can. So the first 400 or 500 wound up on the floor somewhere. Then I wrote one called Melissa.","I could not see myself going back into the studio without Tommy Dowd, our beloved producer who passed away in 2002. Then in 2009, Michael Lehman, my manager, really pushed me to meet with T Bone Burnett. I ended up meeting with T Bone in Memphis, and we hit it off right away; I knew he was a guy I could work with.","Gotta take my puppy on the road with me, Killer.","I would like to be remembered as a - somebody who could rock your soul or make your cry with a song. And somebody who's kind, who loved to laugh, and loved his God.","I got tired of playing other people's songs.","The Beatles had just come out, and everybody had a band. It was incredible competition out there.","There are as many ways to write songs as there are songs.","I play every show like it's my last. Fortunately, that's never turned out to be the case.","My goal is to put out an album with every song being an original composition of mine. I want the credits to read, 'All songs written by Gregory L. Allman' - that is something I really want to make happen.","The best advice I got really had nothing to do with singing; it came from my brother, who always told me to stick to my guns and to believe in myself. I think Duane saw my talents and believed in me long before I ever did, and that meant the world to me.","I have been going to the gym instead of the bar, trying to get back down to my fighting weight.","At the Muddy Waters thing, I played the first song by myself on an acoustic guitar. I thought that was great that y'all did that tribute to Muddy Waters. I had a real good time.","Clapton asked my brother to play on his record. I thought that was the most wonderful thing in the world.","I didn't think we would ever make enough money to pay rent by playing music.","I got Jimmy Hall from Wet Willie and he also plays now with Hank Williams Jr.","The booking agent had the audacity to take 10 percent, so we wound up with about $100 a week apiece.","When I got out of high school, I thought, I'll take a year or two off and play the clubs, get this out of my system, and then go to med school.","You got to be pretty thin to be in the movies, or it helps. I would actually love to do it.","In my line of business, there's no better feeling than having a real nice work that you're really satisfied with.","Yeah, like, when I look back on my life, I just remember back what happened in '74, or something. It seems like only the real good stuff comes to mind. I don't think of all the tragedies and all the funerals. That just doesn't come to mind at all. I guess I'm really blessed that way.","As they say in the bible, that you're supposed to rejoice when people die and mourn when they're born, because it's one of the most painful acts you go through in life, is being born, and dying.","I left home the day after I graduated from high school because I knew we weren't going to make any dough to pay the rent in music.","I've come to the conclusion that I'm not supposed to be married.","My father was murdered when I was two. Duane, even though he was only a year and 18 days my elder, he became a father figure to me. I would have done anything for my brother - I loved him so much.","There's only one cook in the kitchen, only one chef. I let the soloists do their thing - you've gotta let a man do a solo the way he wants - but as far as picking the tunes and working on the arrangements, I take full responsibility for it.","I was always the Doubting Thomas of the bunch, and I don't think I was convinced about the Allman Brothers until 'Fillmore East' hit - that one removed all doubt!","'Queen of Hearts' is one I'm really proud of because I worked so hard on it, and then I was told it wasn't good enough to be included on an Allman Brothers album. That directly led me to go into the studio and cut 'Laid Back,' my first solo release. So 'Queen of Hearts' is special to me.","When you travel on a bus with guys who love all kinds of music, you get exposed to some great stuff, man.","People always lean toward who's the best guitar player, who's the best singer? I don't see it that way. They're all the best, you know? They've all gotten your attention, you've admired them, you've tried to sing like them. That makes them the best, each and every one of 'em.","So many people out there can probably sing very good - all they need to do is just drop their inhibitions. That's why most people do their singing in the shower.","Pop just didn't have enough substance for me. All this nyah-nyah-nyah, you know, 'Paper Tiger' and 'Hold the Ladder, James' and 'Crimson and Clover.' That wasn't music!","Stage fright is not a thing about 'Am I any good?' It's about 'Am I gonna be good tonight?' It's a right-now thing. It helps me. If I went out there thinkin', 'Eh, we'll go slaughter 'em,' I'm positive something would go seriously wrong.","The thing with the piano is, the piano is like percussion almost - well, it is. You have to... not beat on it, but there is more work involved than a Hammond. With a Hammond, you just lay your hands on the keys, man, and you're gone.","Duane Allman was the best guitar player I ever heard who didn't read a note.","I've never sat down and tried to write something for some occasion. You just write the tune and stay totally wide open to everything. It'll find the person or persons who are supposed to do it.","I really told my story as I saw it in 'Cross to Bear,' and I was pleased - and a bit surprised - by how well it was received and how it sold. No. 2 on the 'New York Times' bestseller list? I'll take that any day, my man!","When I got out of high school, I thought, 'I'll take a year or two off and play the clubs, get this out of my system, and then go to med school.' More than 40 years later, I figure it's finally time to write about this crazy journey that's taken me around the world and back."],"Gregg Easterbrook":["Stereotypes involving Christian identity, Christian persecution is so far back in history now that no one fears it being revived, unless you live in China, I guess.","I didn't view myself as attacking the boss. I viewed my boss at ESPN as the publisher and president of ESPN.","It was actually a very nice little book done by a gift book company. They illustrated it with pictures from 1920s football, before there were face guards.","Torture numbers, and they'll confess to anything.","And if there was something, suppose I wanted to write something really damning or embarrassing about one of the owners, that would really be a problem on the NFL's site.","And then ESPN fired me. I did not think that was a fitting punishment.","But by showing us live coverage of every bad thing happening everywhere in the world, cable news makes life seem like it's just an endless string of disasters - when, for most people in most places today, life is fairly good.","But if you could make that mistake and press the send button and the entire world sees it forever.","Even though Rush is not me and the situations were very different, I think, in the Rush Limbaugh thing, ESPN was criticized for not acting, and you remember that after a couple days of controversy over Rush.","Everyone needs a certain amount of money. Beyond that, we pursue money because we know how to obtain it. We don't necessarily know how to obtain happiness.","For what I wrote that started this whole controversy, I deserved to be criticized, and I felt bad about writing it. I felt bad mainly as a writer and a thinker.","Heroic people take risks to themselves to help others. There's nothing heroic about accepting $5 million to go out and run around chasing a ball, although you may show fortitude or those other qualities while you do it.","I behaved poorly by starting this whole thing and I made some mistakes in dealing with it, and they made some mistakes in dealing with me, and taking down all my stuff was probably one of them.","I don't think there are many larger lessons to be found in sports.","I think professional sports, football, to use it as an example, it's fundamentally a form of entertainment.","I think that might have been an element in it, and people have asked me that very thing. Remember, Disney is the majority shareholder, but it is not an operating division of Disney.","I think the thing that I most appreciate now is that stereotypes involving Jewish identity activate fears of persecution that exist in the present day.","I'm a smart guy, I know the history of this issue and why people care about it.","I'm working seven days a week in the fall. I couldn't possibly keep that up. This is only for the fall. In the last couple of years I've tended to do most of my serious writing in the winter, when there's nothing going on with football.","Inevitably, these sorts of things are going to come back to blow up in people's faces.","It was Orwellian. I completely disappeared, and disappeared the same day. It was by early that evening when the Times story ran. That was an overreaction. All human beings under pressure behave poorly.","Jewish persecution is a historical memory of the present generation and people fear it in the present day, and that's why those references are so much more powerful. I just understand that better now.","Now, for pure bloggers, for individual people who are just posting their own thoughts, they would still run the same risk of saying something wrong or embarrassing, but they wouldn't harm their institutions by doing so.","You know, some of the good part of blog theory was that blogs would be like diaries that the world could read. They would be spontaneous, whatever pops into your mind, as a diary would be."],"Gregg Harper":["Folks have a common misconception that Mississippi is strictly a rural, outdoors state. While we are famous for our hunting, sport fishing and year-round golf, we also have leading manufacturers like Peavey Electronics and Viking Range Corp.","Trying to find my way around the Rayburn building is always a challenge. Combining my poor sense of direction with a confusing design is not good.","I would like to acquire a document autographed by John Witherspoon, who signed the Declaration of Independence and is one of my American heroes."],"Gregg Henry":["Actors really are superstitious. You can always spot a group of actors at a restaurant. They're the ones spitting on their knuckles and hurling salt everywhere.","Like many actors, I'm very grateful, I feel very fortunate, very lucky to be able to make a living with what I do and what I love. I'm surprised and grateful all the time.","I consider myself an actor that tries to have as many tools as possible in the bag. And I think that includes the method, then of course it includes some improv techniques, and includes all kinds of different things, because you never know when you're going to have to work on something and in what way.","I'd trained at the University of Washington and had a Bachelor of Fine Arts in acting."],"Gregg Sulkin":["If I had any advice to give people, it would be to relax; never treat an audition like an emergency. There will be plenty more in your career. If you think you messed up, you probably didn't. And if you did mess up, it's not the end of the world.","There are more things to worry about in the world than a messed-up audition. It's out of your hands. So often, it's not down to acting abilities but something an actor has no control over. So go in, be prepared, do your job, and go and enjoy the rest of your day.","The Jewish community is all about love and family, which is the most important thing in my life, too.","I didn't ever think about being an actor. But I fell in love with it when I realized how amazing, difficult, and interesting it is.","The fans on 'Pretty Little Liars' were the craziest fans I've ever met in my life in the best possible way. The dedication that those fans have to the show and the characters is amazing.","Ever since I was young, I played sports.","I know when I have kids, when I'm older, I'm going to encourage them to play sports because I think it teaches you a lot. It teaches you discipline, teamwork, and that there's really no 'I' in team.","I've played American characters so many times now, it's so natural to me. But when I play American, I stay in the American accent from the minute I get the job till the minute I wrap.","I love sports, and when I was playing soccer, I was always trying to be the leader on the team and the one who takes control."],"Gregor Mendel":["My scientific studies have afforded me great gratification; and I am convinced that it will not be long before the whole world acknowledges the results of my work.","The value and utility of any experiment are determined by the fitness of the material to the purpose for which it is used, and thus in the case before us it cannot be immaterial what plants are subjected to experiment and in what manner such experiment is conducted."],"Gregor Strasser":["The rise of National Socialism is the protest of a people against a State that denies the right to work.","If the machinery for distribution in the present economic system of the world is incapable of properly distributing the productive wealth of nations, then that system is false and must be altered.","The important part of the present development is the anti-capitalist sentiment that is permeating our people."],"Gregorio Sablan":["I love to walk. Back home, I do that every day. I leave home and walk, and go walk for hours.","My wife doesn't like me eating doughnuts. I love doughnuts.","I've always had this core belief in public service. Even before I became a citizen, I volunteered in the Army.","We in Congress must take action to keep assault weapons and high-capacity clips out of the hands of those who are so dangerous or deranged or deluded that they can snuff out the life of innocents on a whim."],"Gregory Bateson":["It is impossible, in principle, to explain any pattern by invoking a single quantity.","Science, like art, religion, commerce, warfare, and even sleep, is based on presuppositions.","But epistemology is always and inevitably personal. The point of the probe is always in the heart of the explorer: What is my answer to the question of the nature of knowing?","Logic is a poor model of cause and effect.","We do not know enough about how the present will lead into the future.","In the transmission of human culture, people always attempt to replicate, to pass on to the next generation the skills and values of the parents, but the attempt always fails because cultural transmission is geared to learning, not DNA.","It is of first-class importance that our answer to the Riddle of the Sphinx should be in step with how we conduct our civilisation, and this should in turn be in step with the actual workings of living systems.","Every move we make in fear of the next war in fact hastens it.","A major difficulty is that the answer to the Riddle of the Sphinx is partly a product of the answers that we already have given to the riddle in its various forms.","All experience is subjective.","If we pursue this matter further, we shall be told that the stable object is unchanging under the impact or stress of some particular external or internal variable or, perhaps, that it resists the passage of time.","It is to the Riddle of the Sphinx that I have devoted fifty years of professional life as an anthropologist.","It is, I claim, nonsense to say that it does not matter which individual man acted as the nucleus for the change. It is precisely this that makes history unpredictable into the future.","Language commonly stresses only one side of any interaction.","Logic can often be reversed, but the effect does not precede the cause.","Members of weakly religious families get, of course, no religious training from any source outside the family.","Number is different from quantity.","Official education was telling people almost nothing of the nature of all those things on the seashores, and in the redwood forests, in the deserts and in the plains.","Rather, for all objects and experiences, there is a quantity that has optimum value. Above that quantity, the variable becomes toxic. To fall below that value is to be deprived.","To think straight, it is advisable to expect all qualities and attributes, adjectives, and so on to refer to at least two sets of interactions in time.","Interesting phenomena occur when two or more rhythmic patterns are combined, and these phenomena illustrate very aptly the enrichment of information that occurs when one description is combined with another.","Money is always transitively valued. More money is supposedly always better than less money.","Numbers are the product of counting. Quantities are the product of measurement. This means that numbers can conceivably be accurate because there is a discontinuity between each integer and the next.","Synaptic summation is the technical term used in neurophysiology for those instances in which some neuron C is fired only by a combination of neurons A and B.","There is a strong tendency in explanatory prose to invoke quantities of tension, energy, and whatnot to explain the genesis of pattern. I believe that all such explanations are inappropriate or wrong."],"Gregory Benford":["True twins share womb chemistry and endure many fateful slings and arrows together. The fabled connection between twins is true in my case.","As fandom grew more variegated, genzines reflected a broadening of interests, carrying personal columns of humor and reflection, science articles, amateur fiction, stylish gossip, and inevitably, thoughtful pieces on the future of fandom.","Aging is mostly the failure to repair.","Electromagnetic theory and experiment gave us the telephone, radio, TV, computers, and made the internal combustion engine practical - thus, the car and airplane, leading inevitably to the rocket and outer-space exploration.","To us large creatures, space-time is like the sea seen from an ocean liner, smooth and serene. Up close, though, on tiny scales, it's waves and bubbles. At extremely fine scales, pockets and bubbles of space-time can form at random, sputtering into being, then dissolving.","I've always felt that specialization is best left to the insects.","The simplest way to remove carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, is to grow plants - preferably trees, since they tie up more of the gas in cellulose, meaning it will not return to the air within a season or two. Plants build themselves out of air and water, taking only a tiny fraction of their mass from the soil.","We hope we can slow or possibly reverse the symptoms of Alzheimer's.","We have a name for people who create universes - they're called gods. There is no greater hubris than to think that we could take the place of godlike implications.","Enzymes - plainly the most important biotechnology of our era - already permeate many industrial processes. Unlike fossil fuels, they carry chemical programming which drives complex reactions, are renewable, and work at ordinary pressures and temperatures.","Congress came to see NASA primarily as a jobs program, not an exploratory agency.","Indeed, the history of 20th century physics was in large measure about how to avoid the infinities that crop up in particle theory and cosmology. The idea of point particles is convenient but leads to profound, puzzling troubles.","In coastal waters rich in runoff, plankton can swarm densely, a million in a drop of water. They color the sea brown and green where deltas form from big rivers, or cities dump their sewage. Tiny yet hugely important, plankton govern how well the sea harvests the sun's bounty, and so are the foundation of the ocean's food chain.","Certainly I see no reason why society should prevent grieving parents from having a baby cloned from the cells of a dead child if they wish.","Invoking nature with its implied supremacy ignores that many cultures have fundamentally differing ideas of even what nature is, much less how it should work.","DNA sequencing opens vast ethical issues. We shall be able to know who has defective genes. What will it mean when we can be sure we're not all born equal? Worked out, the implications will scare a lot of people. Insurance companies will not want to cover those with a genetic predisposition to illness, for example. Here lurk myriad lawsuits.","In temperate zones, winter is the best insecticide; it keeps the bugs in check. The tropics enjoy no such respite, so plants there have developed a wide range of alkaloids that kill off nosy insects and animals.","The talk shows I've done are all radio for exactly this reason: I don't want to wear a rubber mask.","Very little useful science got done in the space station. NASA never did the experiments needed to develop the technologies required for a genuine interplanetary expedition: centrifugal gravity to avoid bodily harm and a truly closed biosphere.","Seeing the space future through science fiction can be difficult. Much science fiction of the early era, the 1950s through the '70s, took an expansionist view.","Science fiction writers didn't predict the fade-out of NASA's manned space operations, and they weren't prepared with alternative routes to space when that decline became undeniable.","Experience shows that if you put more ethicists on a problem, you can end up with more problems.","The earliest depiction of libertarian eugenics may have appeared in a science fiction novel, Robert Heinlein's 1942 tale 'Beyond This Horizon.'","The Matrix itself is not some external evil, but rather an outcome of our own error, our karmic payoff of past actions. Not merely illusion, it is an allusion to a founding myth of our culture.","In science fiction, basic doubts featured prominently in the worlds of Philip K. Dick. I knew Phil for 25 years, and he was always getting onto me, a scientist. He was a great fan of quantum uncertainty, epistemology in science, the lot.","As a literature of change driven by technology, science fiction presents religion to a part of the reading public that probably seldom goes to church.","Mathematics cannot handle physical quantities like density that literally go to infinity.","Dinner at college high table is one of the legendary experiences of England. I could remember keenly each one I had attended; the repartee is sharper than the cutlery.","Like immense time-binding discussions, genres allow ideas to be developed and traded, and for variations to be spun down through decades.","'Star Trek' is notorious for looting the more thoughtful work of writers for their striking effects, leaving behind most of the thought and subtlety.","Genre pleasures are many, but the quality of shared values within an ongoing discussion may be the most powerful, enlisting lifelong devotion in its fans.","Star Trek's insight lay in the promise of going to the stars together, with well-defined stereotypes who could supply the emotional frame for the potentially jarring truths of these distant places.","Like the ocean, land plants hold about three times as much carbon as the atmosphere. While oceans take many centuries to exchange this mass with the air, flora take only a few years.","My brother Jim and I shared a womb without a view for nine months.","Reared in rural southern Alabama, we enjoyed an idyllic Huck Finn boyhood. But education there was casual at best. Our mother and father were high school teachers and challenged the pervasive easy-going ignorance.","I have an artificial left shoulder, wired back together after a softball accident.","The common liberal orthodoxy that living close to the land leads to eco-awareness is historically naive, considering that Mesopotamia, northern Africa, and the Mayan civilization were ruined by people who had lived there quite a long while.","Around 1930, a small new phenomenon arose in Depression-ridden America, spawned out of the letter columns in science fiction magazines: fandom.","Fandom grew first through individual correspondence. It was cheap and quick, continent-wide contact for a penny stamp.","Virtuality - connection without proximity - is a major attraction in both fandom and the Net. Nobody knows you're a dog through the U.S. mail, either. Fans could be utterly different in their fanzine persona, which may be why both fandom and the Net were invented by individualistic Americans.","As we all saw in grade school, once you learn how to read a book, somebody is going to want to write one - that's how authors are made. Once we know how to read our own genetic code, someone is going to want to rewrite that 'text,' tinker with traits - play God, some would say.","To deliver vast new resources to humanity, we must pioneer and occupy the moon, Mars, and perhaps even beyond.","Terraforming our moon will take many decades and vast abilities. Before we can begin, we'll have to master the resources of our solar system - especially transporting raw masses over interplanetary distances.","Our moon was born too small to harbor life. It came from the collision of a Mars-sized world into the primordial Earth. From that colossal crunch spun a disk of rocks that condensed into a satellite.","The moon's closeness is a huge advantage: To make it habitable, we would first have to bombard it with water-ice comets, a tricky endeavor best attempted with the many resources waiting on and near Earth.","It turns out that if you optimize the performance of a car and of an airplane, they are very far away in terms of mechanical features. So you can make a flying car. But they are not very good planes, and they are not very good cars.","A view of nature as dense and nonlinear is at the core of our contemporary science. Process and order emerge subtly.","The world is neither running down nor deterministic, and a strict division of order versus chaos is just wrong.","In the end, postmodern art is obscene not because it is offensive, but because it is boring.","Nostalgia is eternal for Americans. We are often displaced from our origins and carry anxious memories of that lost past. We fear losing our bearings.","The thing that most critics miss about Faulkner is that his famous storytelling voice is, in fact, a standard Southern storytelling voice that is typical of the Gulf Coast - Mississippi, Alabama and so on.","I like audacious ideas.","My feeling is that science is virtually an unexplored ground. It's very visible - more so all the time - but there's no fiction that tells us how scientists think, and they really don't think the way that other people do.","When Joseph Wambaugh writes about the LAPD, you listen because you know he knows the scene. Lots of people write cop novels, but they don't have that authenticity.","It really helps if you know your subject matter immediately. I find that enormously useful because then you can concentrate on all the usual novelistic things - the character, the plot and so forth - and you don't have to spend an enormous amount of time learning another trade, essentially.","This was the 1940s; there was no television. It was a different age - it was not swamped by media; it was swamped by reality, and storytelling was a very big art where I came from.","Science would lead you to a more interesting life than something else.","The people who built the space program - both Soviet and U.S. - were readers of science fiction.","Because I've been a full professor doing research and lecturing at the University of California, I didn't have a lot of time to write, so I have always used my unconscious a great deal to do the really heavy lifting.","At the end of the day, I sit down for about five minutes and review all the problems I'm working on, research problems or writing problems, and I go to sleep. Then when I wake up in the morning, I've trained myself to not open my eyes and to just lie there and recall the problems and see if there's anything there.","You don't actually have ideas; ideas have you.","I'm a very big Faulkner fan 'cause I'm a Southerner.","Whatever the life form, evolution selects for economy of resources.","Will searching for distant messages work? Is there intelligent life out there? The SETI effort is worth continuing, but our common-sense beacons approach seems more likely to answer those questions."],"Gregory Corso":["Now, twenty years old, I come out and I go back to Greenwich Village. Now, of course, I'm a wealthy man.","They, that unnamed 'they,' they've knocked me down but I got up. I always get up-and I swear when I went down quite often I took the fall; nothing moves a mountain but itself. They, I've long ago named them me.","My background did not start with the East Side; it started with Greenwich Village, which is West Side.","The other guy I dug a lot was Burroughs because he was a smart man already; he learned it through the druggie pool - the street scene of an old aristocratic kind of man.","Anyway, I lived on the streets and did pretty good until I got caught stealing, what was it? I kicked in a restaurant window, went in and took all the food that I wanted, and while coming out I was grabbed.","I just trust people and they sense everything's gonna be alright.","I moved up over Lower East Side and I was adopted by eight foster parents; I lived all over New York City with these parents, man, till I was about ten years old.","I remember the people I knew in prison; I was very fortunate to know them - they came from 1910, 1920, 1930.","I was what? - twelve years old - and I was thrown in the cells with these people, so I learned fast.","My father took me back home, back to Greenwich Village, and he thought by taking me out of the orphanage he'd be out of the World War too. But no way - they got him anyway. He went in the Navy and then I lived on the streets.","My father went into the armed service and I never saw my mother - I don't know what happened to her.","Now the Tombs, like the name says, are so horrible that they had to close it down. Today it doesn't exist and people go in the electric chair and all that.","The judge said I was a menace to society because I had put crime on a scientific basis.","The lucky thing was that I was Italian; when the other Italians saw me fight back, they came to my defence.","You see, I went to the sixth grade and that was the highest I ever went."],"Gregory David Roberts":["Once you love something, you can never stop loving it. Even after a divorce, the heart will not stop loving.","More dreams are realised and extinguished in Bombay than any other place in India.","The choking humidity makes amphibians of us all, in Bombay, breathing water in air; you learn to live with it, and you learn to like it, or you leave.","I think the novel form chose me. I was a writer before I became a criminal... my first instinct was to write.","I've been to Delhi, Madras, Bangalore and a lot of other cities, but I have never seen a crime set-up like that in Bombay.","A city may be dirty on the outside but is clean on the inside. Many cities in the world are clean on the outside but dirty on the inside.","'Shantaram' is the second in the series of a quartet of novels that I have planned about my life but is the first to be written. The third book is a sequel to 'Shantaram,' the first a prequel.","Nobody who has done business in any country with an Indian would doubt the shrewdness of Indians, but what Indian people bring to the world is something special and unique, which is the capacity for a loving interaction.","Sometimes, when you live a life at such a wild edge, an extreme edge of experience, you can come back into the world - if you come back at all - with some essence from that experience that people find useful.","Crime is stupid, lazy and weak. You can only exploit it and make money out of it.","Because my life has been so notorious and so bad, it can overshadow my work."],"Gregory H. Johnson":["It's a wonderful experience to look at our Earth.","I did a little bit of flying in high school, but I've just always been inspired and excited about airplanes.","NASA has made a difference.","The building of the International Space Station is something wonderful, and it will show us how to take the next step beyond low-Earth orbit.","John Glenn's anniversaries have followed me all of my life. I was born in 1962, the year he orbited Earth.","Children often ask me, they say, 'Well, how do you become a fighter pilot, or how do you become an astronaut, or...?' And I say, 'Love what you're doing and do it very well.'","My first date was with Endeavour, and my last date is going to be with Endeavour, as far as space shuttles are concerned.","I'm just tickled pink that I'll be on Endeavour's last flight.","I was watching a black and white television in Cairo, MI., at my grandparents' house, and I watched Neil Armstrong step on the moon. At that point, it set the bit for me to be an astronaut, and it was kind of like a dream, but it really wasn't reality.","I progressed through my schooling, undergraduate and graduate degrees, excited about math and science and engineering, but really didn't think about being an astronaut at that point. It was kind of unreachable.","I loved being a test pilot, and so being an astronaut was - was not my end point in, you know, either I achieved success by being an astronaut, or if I don't get picked, I'm not successful. I loved my career as a pilot, and it was a bonus to be selected as an astronaut.","I was a military brat; we moved all around.","I remember the first time that I flew on an airplane overseas, it was about when I was seven; it was 1969.","It still amazes me, when I go out and fly the T-38, and I'm looking at those little, short, skinny little wings, and that thing's flying. It's just amazing to me, even now.","One of my favorite places on the planet is a place in northern Michigan: Long Lake in Traverse City.","When you look at the Earth's horizon and see the thickness of the atmosphere, it's not even the thickness of an orange peel.","I really like connecting with kids.","My brother still lives in the house my parents owned in Fairborn. I go back there a lot to visit friends and keep my connection to the National Museum of the Air Force and my membership with the Dayton Engineers Club.","When I started flying, I realized how enjoyable it was, and flying became my main focus while engineering went on the back burner."],"Gregory Harrison":["Suddenly Star Wars came out while we were on hiatus, and we looked like the old Buck Rogers series, where they had cigarette smoke blowing out the back of the rocket ship.","So I got interested in singing and I have always used my voice. Not professionally as much, but around the living room, the campfire, that kind of thing.","7th Heaven is quite a hit for them now, and they are hoping to appeal to a very similar audience with our show; skewed slightly older I guess, since it's a 9:00 to 10:00 show.","Actually I have been singing since I was a kid.","And that's the mistake that was made with Steel Pier. Roger was caught between a rock and hard place. It would have cost a couple of million dollars more to take it to Boston or someplace first. So we opened about a month too early.","Brian and I got cast out of that show into Trapper John, M. D.","But I always held my music up and protected it from compromise. So I just do it for my friends. I've written hundreds of songs, and I'm sure I have a few albums worth of songs.","But I can't wait to watch the Tonys this Sunday. I'm really glad Broadway is doing so well this year, especially with its straight plays. It's been a wonderful year.","But we were doing plays and movies which I had nothing to do with other than being a producer, and I don't have that kind of interest or time any more.","Honestly, when I got to Hollywood I was trying to sell my songs.","I didn't feel compromised as an actor, and allowed other people's fingerprints all over that aspect.","I directed an episode of Touched by an Angel a couple of months ago, and I will be doing more of that. I just like to keep a bit of variety going; it keeps things interesting.","I got a series with the WB next year. We start shooting in July. It's going to be called Safe Harbor, and it's an hour show. It's a Spelling show and will follow 7th Heaven.","I had done a lot of plays, particularly at my own theater in LA, and it was the first time in my theatrical life where I didn't feel that my role was also to keep everybody else working hard.","I have a big family and had to move them all from the coast of Oregon to New York three times for the workshops and for the actual production itself, which had about a four month development rehearsal schedule.","I have four kids; three girls and a boy. The oldest girl is 13, and has her own social life now, so there's a bit of begrudging cooperation there. It's tough.","I have kept a part of Catalina Productions going, through which I develop a few projects just for me.","I have to be very careful about how often I drag my family to places. They need some stability in their lives.","I have to own something before I can say it, and I have to own it before I can sing it as well, emotionally. I only enjoy acting and singing if I am believing what I am doing.","I learned to play guitar at a young age and converted poems and stuff that I had written to songs.","I love to sing and I do think that my strength as a singer is... I think I have a voice that is certainly sufficient under most any circumstances... but I think my strength is that I really am an actor and I really do have to own what I am saying.","It was the first time that I was on Broadway, and I got to run as fast as I could to keep up. And I loved it!","Then when I got to Hollywood, the first musical I did was Festival in 1977.","Well, I want to do The Music Man. I think it's an amazing opportunity, but I think that they are probably looking at major movie stars right now, and I don't blame them.","What I ended up doing was becoming an actor who didn't mind doing other people's words."],"Gregory Hines":["I don't remember not dancing. When I realized I was alive and these were my parents, and I could walk and talk, I could dance.","I've had times when I've done what seems like a thousand interviews to promote a film that I'm in. I start to think that I'm the best thing that ever happened to the world, talkin' about myself for cryin' out loud. Then I come home, and my wife needs me to help with dinner and empty the garbage, and the kids need help with their homework.","I never wanted to be a star, I just wanted to get work.","I read the script, and I knew it was a good part. It was written for a white actor. That's what I'm up against - I have to try to make roles happen for me that aren't written black.","I'm going to tap until I can't: I'll be so old, all I can do is walk out from the wings to stage center. But I'll be there.","It turned out to be exactly that, but more challenging emotionally. I looked at it in a more physical way, having to act in a chair and move around. But it really was more emotionally challenging.","My character had been in the chair for seven years. He had gone through his anger, depression, drug and alcohol abuse. He had gone through everything, now he was up, he was happy, he was filled with his dream.","You know the first time I sat in the chair I felt anything but up, it was very emotional for me. I had a chair in my hotel room, a chair at rehearsal, and I was trying to spend as much time as I could in the chair.","I can remember feeling very angry, and saying no! I can do it myself! From that point of view it was very emotional for me to get myself to the point to sit in the chair and be 'up'.","They were very generous with me. Everybody was willing to talk about their particular accident, what they had to deal with and how they got back in touch with their competitors' spirit.","It would be like the films I've seen where wardens would decide to be in a jail cell for a week, to get a sense of what it would be like to be a prisoner.","They told me that the hotels had maybe two rooms set up for people with disabilities, but if they got there too late, and didn't get one of these rooms, they couldn't take a shower. The room wasn't hooked up for them, or maybe the sink was too high.","I think everybody at some point - especially if they've been working their whole lives - should take time out and think about what they've done.","Once I got to be about twenty-five, I got interested in the music of the time. I started smokin' dope, I started drinking, I started slowing down and trying to find myself. I didn't want to work in nightclubs.","I wanted to make a movie, because the whole life of the movies appealed to me. You work hard for three or four months, then you don't work at all for a couple of months.","My roots are on the live performing stage, so while I enjoy making films and the other things that I do, when I get on stage, I feel at home; I'm comfortable.","One of the things about working on stage - actually, about working in show business, that is - is that it's such a collaborative effort. I suppose that everything in life is - every endeavor where people are able to be successful.","As parents, we're human beings, too, but sometimes we're not as understanding as we'd like to be.","I grew up in the '50s, a tough time for African Americans. I had friends whose fathers would openly say, 'Just bite your tongu;, don't cause any problems.' My father was not like that. Even in the toughest times racially, if somebody disrespected his family, they were in trouble.","My father has always been my hero.","I like to do an interview when the other person isn't expecting it. I find it's more spontaneous.","When my brother and me got into performing in the late '40s and early '50s, it was a sensational opportunity to learn from our elders. Every show we played had a dancer, a comic, a juggler, a singer, an acrobat. I came to appreciate virtuosity in all forms of the business."],"Gregory Isaacs":["Look at me as a man who performed works musically. Who uplift people who need upliftment, mentally, physically, economically - all forms. Who told the people to live with love 'cause only love can conquer war, and to understand themselves so that they can understand others.","If I produce myself, I'm gonna exploit no one - just myself.","Since I was growing up, I liked love songs - Smokey Robinson, Sam Cooke. That was the kind of songs getting the girls dancing.","Bob Marley was one of my favourite artists. He sang politically conscious lyrics, yet he sang love songs, too.","When people hear the name Gregory Isaacs, I want dem to think of 'Night Nurse' and 'Red Rose For Gregory' and 'The Cool Ruler.' I love it when somebody comes up to me and say, 'I love your songs.'","The Gregory Isaacs feel is universal, trying to uplift who I can uplift. I sing music on a worldwide basis. That is made to be accepted in thy sight."],"Gregory Keyes":["My degrees are in anthropology, and I have friends who have worked with apes.","I was pretty young when I saw the original 'Planet of the Apes', and for a time in the seventies, I was pretty obsessed with it.","It takes a while to get a movie together, and they don't start talking books until the movie is close to being finished."],"Gregory Maguire":["I write because I admire the act of rationalization, of seeking clarity in one's understanding of the complexities of life, and I'm bad at it. I'm slow. Writing, which is an arduous and slow process, proceeds at the same rate as my sloth-like mind.","While I pride myself on trying to be creative in all areas of my life, I have occasionally gone overboard, like the time I decided to bring to a party a salad that I constructed, on a huge rattan platter, to look like a miniature scale model of the Gardens of Babylon.","When I began 'Wicked', I really thought of it entirely as a one-off, as the English say. There was no intention that there should ever be a follow up, because the subtitle was 'The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West'. She was dead and gone, as the book says, at the end.","I'm a comic writer, in some ways, and a comic person when I'm up at a podium, in order to disguise the fact that in my heart I'm disgustingly earnest.","When I write a book, I write very cleanly from page one to the last page. I hardly ever write out of sequence.","I never write a book unless I can't help it. Something has to bother me, like a mosquito, until I have to do something to relieve the itch.","My first job was scooping ice cream at Friendly's in Albany, New York. I hated the work, most of my colleagues, and the uniform, and I more or less lost my taste for ice cream permanently.","I like classical music of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and I adore Bach above all.","I had written children's books for 14 years before I published 'Wicked.' And none of them were poorly reviewed, and none of them sold enough for me to be able to buy a bed.","I like to think I'm a pretty good-natured guy and pretty civil and probably not ever truly guilty in any serious way of any legal infractions.","I didn't even realize this at first, but there's almost no central character in any of my 24 books who doesn't have a dead mother or a lost parent.","My tastes in music tend to favor anything my kids don't like, out of natural antipathy amplified by a sort of malicious glee.","I was just about to begin writing 'Mirror Mirror', within about a week of it, when September 11, 2001 happened. I found myself incapable of caring about fiction-making for a number of months.","Have you ever noticed when you look in a mirror, unless you're really depressed or something, the person in the mirror generally looks a little more competent, a little more curious, a little more intelligent than you actually feel yourself to be? They often look more interesting and more soulful.","The story of 'Mirror Mirror' is in many ways a story about evolution. It's about the evolution of a child into an adult. It's about the evolution of those dwarves into something a little less rock-like, a little more humanoid. It's about the evolution of history, too, from the darkness of the Middle Ages into the light of the Age of Reason.","I'm not a writer because I want to make money. I'm a writer because I'm a very slow thinker, but I do care about thinking, and the only way I know how to think with any kind of finesse is by telling stories.","In a sense, 'Out of Oz' is an examination of how individuals keep going, keep reinventing themselves and their lives, even after life-altering complications have afflicted them.","I do love to sing. Had I a longer set of thigh bones and a sweeter voice, I should have loved to be a performer.","I actually prefer female voices to listen to, mostly, but among the male singers whose voices I like are Jeff Buckley, Art Garfunkel, that sort of voice. Contemporary crooners rather than rockers."],"Gregory Meeks":["I'm a product of public housing. My parents grew up poor, but their dream was to own a home.","If you put a purchase on a charge card, you're paying it off forever. You have to know how to pay it off before you go deeply in debt.","If I had my choice, every high school would be teaching financial literacy along with math and science.","When it comes to investments, I have to go to someone else to understand them, but then I have to make a judgment. I can't do that if I don't have a basic understanding myself.","I live like most of the people in my district: paycheck to paycheck."],"Gregory Nunn":["It is harder for a poor man to be successful than it is for a rich man.","The right man, in the right place, at the right time, can steal millions.","Never underestimate the value of cold cash.","If you want to really know what your friends and family think of you die broke, and then see who shows up for the funeral.","A liberal is a man who is right most of the time, but he's right too soon.","All the world's a stage, and all the clergymen critics.","Grief, and an estate, is joy understood.","Anyone who doesn't miss the past never had a mother.","There is no such thing as a harmless truth."],"Gregory Peck":["Tough times don't last, tough people do, remember?","Faith gives you an inner strength and a sense of balance and perspective in life.","Inside of all the makeup and the character and makeup, it's you, and I think that's what the audience is really interested in... you, how you're going to cope with the situation, the obstacles, the troubles that the writer put in front of you.","I'm not a do-gooder. It embarrassed me to be classified as a humanitarian. I simply take part in activities that I believe in.","There we were, hundreds of us lined up, waving at the great man as he tipped his hat to us. And that is the extent of my acquaintance with Albert Einstein.","What did I do in high school? I grew from 5 feet 4 inches to 6 feet 2 inches.","I don't lecture and I don't grind any axes. I just want to entertain.","My feeling about him is that the America that we have today, the freedoms we enjoy and the privileges we have, are really the reflection of Abe Lincoln's convictions, his vision, and his toughness.","I never liked the name Eldred. Since nobody knew me in New York, I just changed to my middle name.","I had that stubborn streak, the Irish in me I guess."],"Gregory Petsko":["For thousands of years, long before there was such a thing as a science of chemistry, people were fascinated by plants, because they knew that plants contained substances that could affect people. Coffee will keep you awake. Tobacco contains something that will calm your nerves. Foxglove contains an extract that'll affect your heart.","As far as protecting yourself against Alzheimer's disease, well, it turns out that fish oil has the effect of reducing your risk for Alzheimer's disease. You should also keep your blood pressure down, because chronic high blood pressure is the biggest single risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.","Alzheimer's disease starts when a protein that should be folded up properly misfolds into a kind of demented origami.","Synchrotron light has revolutionized the field of protein crystallography. It has made it possible to look at much larger structures with much smaller crystals.","A whole host of things that we now know are drugs turn out to be plant alkaloids.","Synthesis is the process of making a natural product, or some other substance, artificially, in the lab, one step at a time, from extremely simple building blocks.","I think the decision to make substances like steroids from plants, rather than from animal tissues, was a landmark in the history of medicine as well as the history of chemistry.","Almost without exception, the talented women I have known have believed they had less ability than they actually had. And almost without exception, the talented men I have known believed they had more.","If you want to lower your risk of Parkinson's disease, caffeine is protective to some extent; nobody knows why. Head injuries are bad for you. They lead to Parkinson's disease."],"Gregory Smith":["I've gone through several cycles. When I was little, I was the cute kid with missing teeth and funny one-liners. Then I moved on to be the young guy who wanted to be a grownup.","I am not a morning person.","I drive an old Camaro that I got when I was 16. And I've been known to do stupid things with my time, like Friendster.","I don't have a cell phone.","I don't cook.","The character I played on 'Everwood' was so serious and melancholic that after doing it for four years, it really started affecting my soul. I was becoming Ephram.","Some projects feel like the stars are aligning for them from the very beginning.","I backpacked all around the world and kind of found myself. Then I settled back in L.A. and found 'Rookie Blue.'","I'll tell you one big misconception. Cops never say 'Freeze!' It might be misinterpreted. They might think you were, like, ordering fries. Or that you had fleas.","When I was 16, I was in a film called 'The Patriot.' I spent every second I could on the set watching the director and his team bring America circa 1775 to life. From that moment on, I was hooked.","A couple of my favourite cop movies are 'I Love a Man in Uniform' and 'The Long Goodbye.'","I didn't watch a lot of cop shows growing up, but I am a huge fan of 'Southland' now.","We've all been there, right? When you meet someone personally and then you find yourself working with them professionally, it's awkward.","It's hard to reinvent the wheel with a cop show. But 'Rookie Blue' has a pure emotional center that's not cynical.","Odd, interesting names are good to me.","My career will come full cycle one day when I play the father of a cute little kid missing teeth who spouts one-liners.","That's basically how I learned everything as an actor. I was just a kid, and I worked with these actors, and I'd ask them questions, and then something would work for me, and I'd try to move forward with it.","Acting is such a strange thing, it's different for everybody.","I'm not a very good interview, usually."],"Gregory Stock":["People who drink four or more cups of coffee a day - it doesn't matter whether it is caffeinated or decaffeinated - have a reduction in Type 2 diabetes, or a reduced incidence of Type 2 diabetes, of about fifty percent. The same with Parkinson's, although there it is more related to the caffeine.","If out of concern over cloning, the U.S. Congress succeeds in criminalizing embryonic stem-cell research that might bring treatments for Alzheimer's disease or diabetes - and Dr. Fukuyama lent his name to a petition that supported such laws - there would be real victims: present and future sufferers of those diseases.","If you judge by what people do to improve their health, they value their lives highly. So adding to your period of vitality is something that most people would certainly do. If there was a pill that would do that, it's clear that everyone would take it.","The genomics revolution, proteomics, metabolomics, all of these 'omics' that sound so terrific on grants and on business plans. What we're doing is we are seizing control of our evolutionary future. I mean we're essentially using technology to just jam evolution into fast-forward.","Consciousness, for me, is a manifestation of complexity in biology. It's an emergent property.","In my view, the most damaging evils that are perpetrated upon us are through some abstract notion about good, where we're willing to sacrifice individuals in the present for some great vision of an improved or perfect future.","We should be happy. We should be enjoying that there is all this bounty. Somebody can take an iPod and have all the world's music at their beck and call in an instant. What an amazing thing!","There is a pent-up demand from people who want to clone their dead children.","Geographic boundaries really begin to disappear with the Internet.","When a couple has a strong preference for a baby boy or girl, who is injured by allowing them to choose? Certainly not the child.","The biggest development in reproductive biology is the birth-control pill. Nobody ever talks about it, but look at the consequences: demographics; aging populations; the sinking population of Europe, Japan; immigration. It's incredible.","A lot of the differences between people have biologic underpinnings. Now, we have a dogma of egalitarianism. Everyone's the same.","Our increasing ability to alter our biology and open up the processes of life is now fueling a new cultural war.","Retarding the aging process would be therapy and enhancement because it would mean defeating diseases and because it would extend our life span.","There are a lot of people highly motivated to be the first to clone a human.","Everybody is going to want to look at their genetics. You're going to want to get a genetic profile.","As we decipher our biology and learn to modify and adjust it, we are learning to modify ourselves - and we will do so. No laws will stop this.","No one really has the guts to say it, but if we could make better human beings by knowing how to add genes, why shouldn't we?","We're all going to eventually, even in the developed world, going to have to lose everything that we love. When you're beginning to rot a little bit, all of the videos crammed into your head, all of the extensions that extend your various powers, are going to being to seem a little secondary."],"Gregory Wasson":["There's an opportunity for the pharmacist to play a much greater role in health care, especially with what we have going on in this country with the shortage of primary-care physicians.","There's an opportunity for the corner drugstore to play a much greater role. Pharmacists have been extremely well respected - they're one of the top two or three most-trusted professionals in opinion polls year after year.","I'll compliment on the spot. I want a clean, neat drugstore. I'll check the restrooms and closets.","When I see something that needs to be corrected, I may talk to a store manager. I don't want to demoralize people when it's beyond their control.","The minute you humiliate people, you've lost them for life."],"Greil Marcus":["The Sixties are most generously described as a time when people took part - when they stepped out of themselves and acted in public, as people who didn't know what would happen next, but who were sure that acts of true risk and fear would produce something different from what they had been raised to take for granted.","No failure in America, whether of love or money, is ever simple; it is always a kind of betrayal, of a mass of shadowy, shared hopes.","I had tremendous fun fooling around with the way people talked about songs, just the way that became another way of understanding the world.","It is a sure sign that a culture has reached a dead end when it is no longer intrigued by its myths.","It may be that the most interesting American struggle is the struggle to set oneself free from the limits one is born to, and then to learn something of the value of those limits.","Elvis transcends his talent to the point of dispensing with it altogether.","We make the oldest stories new when we succeed, and we are trapped by the old stories when we fail.","Elvis' early music has drama because as he sang he was escaping limits.","I never find myself even catching lyrics until something in the sound has taken me captive. Thinking about anything else is just the pleasurable byproduct of wow.","Bob Dylan continues to release odd and unsettling records, and to do odd and unsettling things on stage. So the term 'still' seems meaningless to me. But the real answer is simple: I listen to Bob Dylan for pleasure more than I listen to anyone else for pleasure.","Farber had a huge effect on me as a writer. I don't mean I write like him. Farber is, first of all, a great stylist, a great writer. Anyone can read Manny Farber's film criticism, whether that person is a novelist, a poet, another critic, a historian, and learn a lot about writing by reading him.","You're going to react to a painting in a way that the painting demands you react.","I'm a fan of Oliver Stone. I like his movies, I like his excess, and I think he has a great capacity for empathy and it comes out more powerfully in this movie than in any of his other films, even the formal 'I'm identifying with the underdog' movies like 'Born on the Fourth of July.'","Patriotism in America, as I understand it, is a matter of suffering, when the country fails to live up to its promises, or actively betrays them.","Hearing things like 'Wake Up' by Lora Logic, or the Raincoats' 'In Love' - that was something I wasn't prepared for. I couldn't hear anything that came before it in the music, and I didn't want to. I was absolutely in love with its out-of-nowhereness.","If 'Mystery Train' is my Nixon book and 'Lipstick Traces' my Reagan book, 'Invisible Republic' is my Bill Clinton book. I really liked Clinton. He made me proud to be part of this country again. For all of his failings, the way he put all that he'd done in jeopardy, I supported him from beginning to end.","I learned that when something just has to be said to move the discussion along, or broaden it or deepen it, if I can just keep my mouth shut for five minutes a student will say it. So for me a lot of teaching is about keeping my mouth shut.","I want another idea, another project, but you can't make them up. They show up."],"Grenville Kleiser":["Good humor is a tonic for mind and body. It is the best antidote for anxiety and depression. It is a business asset. It attracts and keeps friends. It lightens human burdens. It is the direct route to serenity and contentment.","By constant self-discipline and self-control you can develop greatness of character.","You can develop good judgement as you do the muscles of your body - by judicious, daily exercise.","Periods of wholesome laziness, after days of energetic effort, will wonderfully tone up the mind and body.","It is often better to have a great deal of harm happen to one than a little; a great deal may rouse you to remove what a little will only accustom you to endure.","To every problem there is already a solution whether you know it or not."],"Gresham Barrett":["While war is never anyone first choice, sometimes it is a necessary choice.","The most insignificant score is the score at halftime.","Younger workers should have more freedom to build their retirement nest egg.","As a dedicated and proud father of three, I am a strong advocate of life. I value life whether born or unborn.","I will always support legislation which respects and values life.","At the end of the day, we need a leader who thinks with his head but leads with his heart.","You may boo, you may turn your back, but I have devoted my life to the conservative cause."],"Greta Garbo":["Anyone who has a continuous smile on his face conceals a toughness that is almost frightening.","Life would be so wonderful if we only knew what to do with it.","The story of my life is about back entrances, side doors, secret elevators and other ways of getting in and out of places so that people won't bother me.","You don't have to be married to have a good friend as your partner for life.","I never said, 'I want to be alone.' I only said, 'I want to be left alone.' There is all the difference.","There are many things in your heart you can never tell to another person. They are you, your private joys and sorrows, and you can never tell them. You cheapen yourself, the inside of yourself, when you tell them.","My talents fall within definite limitations. I am not as versatile an actress as some think.","Is there anything better than to be longing for something, when you know it is within reach?","This is where I have wasted the best years of my life.","There is no one who would have me - I can't cook.","If you are blessed, you are blessed, whether you are married or single.","I want to be alone.","It is bitter to think of one's best years disappearing in this unpolished country.","Your joys and sorrows. You can never tell them. You cheapen the inside of yourself if you do tell them.","Being a movie star, and this applies to all of them, means being looked at from every possible direction. You are never left at peace, you're just fair game.","I don't want to be a silly temptress. I cannot see any sense in getting dressed up and doing nothing but tempting men in pictures.","I smoke all the time, one after the other.","I wish I were supernaturally strong so I could put right everything that is wrong.","If only those who dream about Hollywood knew how difficult it all is.","There are some who want to get married and others who don't. I have never had an impulse to go to the altar. I am a difficult person to lead.","There seems to be a law that governs all our actions so I never make plans.","I'm tired and nervous and I'm in America. Here you don't know that you live."],"Greta Gerwig":["I'm not goal-oriented so much as I'm constantly aware of what I'm passionate about, and I'm constantly updating the list. I envision many possible futures for myself where I could be happy, so I just try to keep my passions alive.","I loved 'Moonlight.' I thought it was really beautiful. Really great.","We would go down to Riverside, California, which is very poor now, but that's where my grandfather grew up. He grew up during the Depression in Riverside.","The more particular you make something, the more universal it becomes.","I've never worked on anything that I haven't in some way enjoyed.","I feel so part of the filmmaking community. It's amazing how much people support each other.","You only get one life, so you might as well feel all the feelings.","There's a grace period where being a mess is charming and interesting, and then I think when you hit around 27, it stops being charming and interesting, and it starts being kind of pathological, and you have to find a new way of life. Otherwise, you're going to be in a place where the rest of your peers have been moving on, and you're stuck.","There's a style in modern dance right now called Release Technique. It's based on a feeling of falling and catching yourself, and I thought it was such a good metaphor for the way life feels.","When you're on set, and that clock is going, every second you spend doing something is a second you spend not doing something else. That's true of all of life, but it's very vivid on a film set because you're always managing that.","I feel like every year there's a thing about 'not enough roles for ladies!' and, then, also an article, like 'The Year of The Woman.' I think that we all just know in our hearts they're underrepresented. But that doesn't mean that there aren't amazing moments.","I live in New York, and I love New York as well, but I think Los Angeles is a place where if you have the right person with you, there are all these little worlds that you would never guess by just looking at the exterior of what the city is.","I have very intense feelings of joy or sadness. I used to not like that so much because I was worried it was girly, and I wanted to be more stoic. I think this happens a lot. When you're 16, there are qualities you wish you didn't have, and then when you're 30, you're like, 'Thank God I have that; otherwise, I'd be living less vividly.'","I'm really interested in trying to tell stories about women that don't involve romantic components. That's so much a part of the way we feel about female characters and their needs that it feels like it's built in - but I'd like to find a way that it's not. There are so many more stories than that.","When you write something you know, you're making a story that will work, whether or not there's bits taken. It's always funny to me when people say, 'Well, it's clearly autobiographical,' and I say, 'Well, how do you know my autobiography?' Certainly, there are things that are connected, but I just think it's a very interesting assumption.","There's something very satisfying about old cameras because they're ingenious. I mean when you take them apart and actually see, 'Oh, this is how we make photographs,' it's an ingenious thing, but it feels like it's in a way a layman can appreciate, whereas a digital camera, I don't even begin to know what goes into making a digital camera.","I thought movies were handed down by God. I knew that theater was made by people because I saw the people in front of me, but movies seemed like they were delivered, wholly made, from Zeus's head or something.","I'm, like, the only actor in New York who's never, ever been on any 'Law & Order.' And I've auditioned for so many. The sad thing is I love 'Law & Order.' I'm really obsessed with it. And they always said to me, 'You seem like you're making fun of the material.'","I think it's true of a lot of teenagers that you're convinced that life is happening somewhere else.","There's nothing more thrilling than watching great actors say things that you wrote and bring them to life.","I don't really decide what the core of the story is before I write. I write to figure out what the story is. And I think the characters end up talking to you and telling you what they want to be doing and what is important to them. So in some ways, your job is to listen as much as it is to write.","Working is not instantly rewarding. It's a long process, and it's much easier to just feed whatever dopamine cycles exist in your brain in instant gratification ways. I get it; I do it.","I thought Mia Hansen-Love was a true auteur, and I always wanted to work with her. Mia's empathy for her characters and her ability to use the language of cinema to communicate real human depth is extraordinary. She's a humanist.","I don't know any woman who has a simple relationship with their mother or with their daughter.","There are a lot of love stories in 'Maggie's Plan,' but the deepest, truly romantic one is between Maggie and her daughter.","I'm interested in long careers where you take detours.","I'm always interested in relationships between women. I'm always interested in how women relate to each other, whether it's a family relationship or it's a friend relationship. That's such uncharted territory in cinema.","One of the things that happens when you write characters - and maybe this is my own sentimentality - is that I always find I have an instinct to protect them.","When you're writing a screenplay, it's like you're dreaming the film for yourself again and again and again until it becomes almost like a memory before you make it.","I didn't know the city at all, but I was so happy to be in New York I cried. I was so excited.","I've never had a plan, I've always done things from instinct.","I had dreams, but I didn't have the sense that they would necessarily work out. They seemed very far-fetched.","Getting bad reviews or doing something that's not great is also really good for you as an actor. It also makes me feel as an actor that I've earned my stripes a bit.","I think as an actress, I prefer having a character on the page. It allows you to be more invested in actually creating a whole person. It's easier when you're not trying to come up with your next line on the spot.","The economy is rough. I think that affects everyone from big filmmakers to tiny filmmakers.","I was serious about ballet for a long time, but my mom got me into tap and jazz and modern and hip-hop, and I was one of those over-lessoned children.","I loved dance.","When I did plays in high school and college, I never remember memorizing my lines, but once I had blocking, I had all my lines memorized. Once I had movement associated with words, it was fine. Before I had blocking, it was just text on a page. Once it became embodied, it was much easier.","I'm not really capable of memorizing stuff without moving around, that's how I do it.","Books and theater were the way I understood the world and also the way I organized my sense of morality, of how to live a good life.","In terms of sheer pleasure, Tom Stoppard was very big for me because he is so funny and so smart, and it felt delicious reading him.","I think being attracted to mistakes is one of the things that film can capture in a way that theater can't. Film can capture a moment of spontaneous life that will never be captured again.","Sacramento is where I grew up, so I felt like it had not been given its proper due in cinema.","Something people say about acting is that acting is listening. But I think that writing is listening, too. That you really have to listen to what are they saying and what they're communicating to you. And so, a lot of it is just getting stuff down.","I'm so interested in taking tropes from other movies and putting them on something where it doesn't belong.","I think structure is so deep in us. We put it in stories we tell our friends or in emails we write. We want it. It's how we create meaning.","The transition from tiny movies to less tiny movies to really big movies has been actually quite seamless in a lot of ways as far as my experience of acting in them.","Writing on my own versus co-writing kind of is the exact same thing because we don't sit in the same room when we write. We're always writing alone anyway.","I'm all for the banalities of life and humiliation and everyday tragedies, but I also think people have big moments, and they have bigness in them.","I think that people in their 20s actually aren't given enough credit for their ambition.","I stopped being interested in improvisation, and I continue to not be that interested in it. Comedians can do it on a different level because they have a goal, but if you're improvising something that's dramatic, there's not that much to be good at.","Everybody is always in the middle of their own opera.","When I was a kid, I used to do my homework in the living room, where there was a picture window. I was hoping that someone would walk by and see me looking very studious in my living room.","I always feel like a vague failure in L.A. - it always makes me feel like I should somehow be different than I am. And I don't know why.","When I graduated from college, I thought that I would probably never be an actor because it seemed like everyone was big by the time they were 20 or not at all.","It's really hard for me to be around people I admire.","I wouldn't call myself 'into the DJ scene.' I have friends who are DJs, like James Murphy. I was really into the DJ scene at his wedding. But generally, I'm not at the clubs. I've never been to a rave.","I was a massive Whit Stillman fan. Groupie. I would have done anything for him.","I love movies, but sometimes I think it's better for actresses not to be total cinephiles. You have to be able to do the work at some point; you can't be totally starstruck. 'I can't believe it's Woody Allen!' You have to get past that.","I sometimes have to turn off the fan part of my brain when I'm acting; otherwise, it would be terrible.","I knew I wanted to be involved with theater or film in any way I could, either as a writer or director or actress.","Acting was always the first love, but a lot of people want to be actors, and my goal was, 'Come hell or high water, I will be a part of this world, however I can.' So that just led me to throwing myself into every aspect of narrative storytelling I could.","I love writing, and I think I'm kind of a workaholic. I'm happiest when I'm working.","For me, the French new wave is Truffaut and Rohmer. Godard I sometimes have trouble with because he's very much of a director's director. I feel Truffaut is such a humanist, and I always go in that direction.","Woody Allen was the reason I wanted to move to New York City and one of the reasons I wanted to make films. I felt that I understood his films, and I love them so much. When you're starting out, certainly, you have this sense of wanting to talk back to people who have influenced you, and I always wanted to talk back to Woody Allen.","As a writer, I think I'm mainly interested in contemporary themes, so when I create my own stuff, it's inherently that. But as an actor, I would like to do lots of different things. I would love to play someone completely different from myself in a costume drama.","I feel like I'm an actor that likes to have lots of points of connection.","For Mike Mills, I learned that having dance parties and crying with your cast does not make you a weak director, it makes you a strong director.","I always have a soft spot in my heart for New York designers and independent designers, people who are doing the fashion equivalent of what I'm trying to do in film.","I feel like a good pair of diamond studs goes a long way. They make everything look dressy, and you just seem more put together.","Young Harrison Ford, what a dreamboat.","I'm scared of the Internet. That's not real, but it is. I'm worried about what it's doing to us.","I sound like an old man when I talk about the Internet, but I am actually worried about what it's doing to our brains and our sense of connection.","I was very serious about ballet until the age of 12, at which point my body changed, and it wasn't quite right.","I was part of a hip-hop group called Fly Style. I was one of two white girls, and I was part of the younger company, which was called Touch of Style. And it was amazing. It gave me a different perception of dance and beauty because the other girls were mostly African-American and Latina.","I'd applied to graduate school for playwriting, and I got rejected by every school. I felt that theatre was closed but that, when it came to film, the door was very slightly ajar. If I have any virtues, it's that I'm good at walking through doors that are slightly ajar.","I've made so many films in New York. There was an assumption I think a lot of people had that I am a New Yorker, that I am from New York, and I always felt like nothing could be further from the truth.","The Catholic theatrics are pretty high quality, but the Protestants have better hymns.","I feel like movies are presents, and credits and fonts are bows and wrapping paper. I like everything to feel like it was given a lot of time. I hate it when I watch movies, and it seems like they just went and picked a font and, like, called it a day.","I'm always interested in how people use language to not say what they mean.","I feel like, when I play characters, I create a space in myself that feels like the character and that doesn't go away. Somehow, you carry that with you. You let it go, but a little piece of it remains.","I have a fundamentally hopeful view about people, and that might merely be a reflection of the fact that I've lived an incredibly privileged life in a very wealthy nation without a lot of the struggles that most of the world has to face.","Having health insurance made me feel like a real person. Up until then, it felt like I was getting away with something, and if three things went wrong, it would all fall apart.","Whenever you work with someone who you idolize, you realize... he's just a person trying to make a movie as best he knows how. And that doesn't look so different from other people trying to do the same thing.","Making movies is a hard thing, and it's slow. So you can glorify the product, but the process is difficult no matter who you are.","One of my favorite things about Telluride is because it's so small, the directors are really there for each other. You look at another director, and they feel the same thing you feel.","I think I've always wanted to direct, but I didn't go to film school. I was lucky enough to work in movies, and I think those became my film school in terms of acting and watching directors work and also writing and co-writing and producing.","I think it's a great tragedy of childhood that you only really appreciate it once it's done: it's very hard to feel appreciative of the gifts you have until you're gone.","Courage doesn't grow overnight. It can be a long process.","I loved the idea of dramatic art of storytelling as a way to make sense of things. It's really what I love and what I care about.","When I read 'Greenberg,' I had a really strong sense if I could be any kind of writer I wanted to be, I'd be this kind of writer. And I felt like, even in my experiences, what writing I had done, even on a small scale, when it was good, it shared some quality with it.","I love big, sprawling movies where there are too many characters, and people get introduced halfway through, and you're like, 'Wait, who are these people?'","I get nerdy and nervous around not only great actors, but great directors and DPs I love.","I love movies, so getting to be in the conversation and meet some of my heroes has been so fun. It's just the most fun thing ever.","Greta Gerwig always seemed like a name that was mine. My mother did a good job.","'A People's History of the United States' was actually a very big book for me. I read it in high school, and I felt like my mind was really blown by it. I think the truth is I read it because it's referenced in 'Good Will Hunting.'","From Rebecca Miller, I took the idea that the director needs to arrive every day an hour ahead of everyone else and walk through the entire day.","From Noah Baumbach, I learned to have a strict no cell phone policy on set. There is nothing that bums you out more than looking over and seeing somebody on their smartphone, and that goes for actors and everyone else.","One of the great advantages of my time spent in movies and in basically every role possible, both in front of the camera and behind the camera, that I've gotten to see all these different ways that people work and the way movies are constructed from the inside out, from beginning to end.","I wrote the script to 'Lady Bird,' and it really came out of a desire to make a project about home - like, what the meaning of home is, and place. I knew Sacramento very well, obviously, growing up there, and I felt like the right way to tell a story of a place was through a person who's about to leave it.","Specifically with directors I'd worked with, and even some that I haven't, they were all incredibly generous with me, having really long conversations about what they felt was useful as tips.","I'm interested in characters that have just a touch of madness.","I just don't feel like I've seen very many movies about 17-year-old girls where the question is not, 'Will she find the right guy' or 'Will he find her?' The question should be, 'Is she going to occupy her personhood?' Because I think we're very unused to seeing female characters, particularly young female characters, as people.","Mike Leigh is my all-time favourite writer/director/creator.","There's something that happens around 27 and 28, when people start coupling off more aggressively or changing their lives according to what their economic prospects are, and not keeping themselves on par with the group - you realise suddenly that they're not your family. And I think that's very painful.","I love musicals. I grew up on musicals.","I have very strong feelings about dance and how it's shot.","I'm far too middle-class to morally object to a paying job.","As an actor, I just go off the director. I never ask how big the part is. I don't look at it from the perspective of, 'Is this going to be good for my career?' I just look for directors, and I think part of that is I knew I always wanted to be a director.","Nobody knows what you have in you until you've done it, so I just keep pushing those boundaries, and I figure it will all come out in the wash.","I think something about high school students being snobby about how much they have or don't have is particularly absurd because it's not theirs. It's their parents'. So to feel quite good about yourself because you've got the fancy house and car doesn't make any sense - you didn't earn any of that.","I lived for two years with six girls in an apartment that was built for three people, and it had no heat. We would sleep in our coats and in sleeping bags. And it was great."],"Greta Scacchi":["A relationship requires a lot of work and commitment.","Theatre is a sacred space for actors. You are responsible; you are in the driving-seat.","I want to come across as a positive person.","Having had a reputation for being sexy is a great prop to lean on now.","In many ways, when you're young and sexy, it's very annoying to be whistled at and to have someone always trying to attract your attention, but now when it happens I find myself registering the fact almost warmly.","I look for people who're passionate, dedicated to the text, and in whom I trust completely.","You seldom get that in film where you're lucky if you get any say at all in the final cut.","On the stage, you alone hold the key, and on the night you have to trust that the director has inspired you enough to take the material and run with it.","With a theatre audience there's always the additional sense of a sustained challenge of which I'm acutely aware and for which you need to have the tools ready - your voice, physicality, brain.","I always knew it was going to be difficult when I got beyong 40, but I didn't realise it would start at 35.","The only work I did for the next five years after splitting from Vincent was work I'd already lined up.","Once, I had so many scripts coming to me that I could hardly read them all.","Hollywood will accept actresses playing ten years older, but actors can play ten years younger.","I avoided nudity unless a film couldn't be told without those scenes. If you look at my films, few of them have that element, yet nudity and male fantasies have become emblematic of my work.","Two people can make love but that isn't necessarily love.","I had the conviction that lovemaking fools you. The overpowering emotions it induces make you think you're sharing the same feelings as the other person and that they're imagining the same as you.","I'm a heathen when it comes to marriage.","It helped me when I decided that we're on this planet to learn to live together and get along.","I have done everything I can to make sure my daughter knows her father because you form your own identity by rebelling against your parents - but first you have to know them.","My father was absent and he was a hero to me.","I have invested some money and I have a home, but people don't realise that you might only be working for a few weeks of the year and remain unemployed the rest of the time.","I've been through some very difficult stages in my life, but I wouldn't change anything.","I feel lucky, happy and philosophical about it all.","I came to Ireland 20 years ago as a student, hitch-hiking round for a week and staying in Dublin."],"Greta Van Susteren":["People often ask why I left CNN - I didn't like management. I liked my colleagues in the news gathering but the corporate culture that seized management when AOL came in (Steve Case and Gerry Levin) was disgusting.","Unfortunately, this is a free society, and we're gonna have people with trucks, and people with bombs.","When Mrs. Bush was First Lady, she went all over the Mideast talking about breast cancer awareness and the need for early screening. She did this in places where the cultures prohibit such discussion or even detection efforts.","I've been a workaholic since I was 18.","Of course, every time someone does a story on plastic surgery, my name will be dragged up. I've made it safe for other people to have plastic surgery. It's no longer a bad word.","My close proximity to many of the newsmakers can give me a different perspective about people in politics and what they might say than others who don't know them.","What person here illegally (and in his right mind), will go to the government, announce being here illegally (e.g. plead guilty), provide all sorts of information as to where that person lives etc. to get a work permit only to be a target for deportation in two years?","As we begin to leave Afghanistan, are we fooling ourselves about what we are leaving behind or what we have promised the people of Afghanistan? Especially the women and girls?","No candidate dares to look for a new campaign model that could really enhance the democratic process. Instead we are left with the current one which makes our candidates look like hucksters.","It is harder to lie in an interview. A good interview - and it can be polite - is not a one way street like a candidate controlled ad. An interview is not programmed by the candidate and so the candidate can't be exactly sure what will be asked.","In an interview with a journalist, you look petty taking the pot shot but in a slick ad you can really do damage - including unfair damage - from afar. It is not that much different than waging a war by a drone than by hand-to-hand combat.","I really enjoy what I'm doing.","Let's not kid ourselves. You pick up 'The Washington Post' and find O.J. Simpson on the front page; 'serious journalists' covered Anna Nicole Smith.","A lot of people in this business are born with money or family connections.","I'm an independent type. No one tells me what to do.","I like really stupid comedies."],"Gretchen Bleiler":["Life is short, and if we enjoy every moment of every day, then we will be happy no matter what happens or what changes along the way.","As long you are doing what you love and making decisions from the heart, you will be successful.","I've learned that you have to make careful choices because everything has an impact. I've also learned that you can't please everyone in life, so please yourself and figure out what really matters.","Your money is power, so be aware of the products you're buying and the companies you're supporting to make sure you're helping the companies that are leading the way in sustainability.","I've had cumulative concussions and realized that's something you carry with you.","I'm so grateful for all the experiences I've had; the life lessons I've learned along the way are just completely invaluable.","I think whenever you have any kind of injury or challenge, you just have to deal with it the best you can. You have to decide what's important to you and focus on getting back to where you want to be. And enjoy where you are and what your goals and dreams are and just give it 100 percent.","I have three brothers, and they were all snowboarders, and I always looked up to them. That's the reason I started snowboarding. I always wanted to be just as good as they were.","I think whenever you get out and do something different, like mountain biking or surfing, it just makes you more aware of your body and balance. For me, I've always loved anything that involved sports, so I've always just tried different things.","I think everyone in snowboarding is close. We've become a big family. It's not a cutthroat sport. I'm competing against one of my best friends, and I think it's cool to be at the top of the half pipe, dropping in with your competitor but your best friend, too.","I love songs with a lot of confidence.","For me, vision is just about the most important thing. So goggles play a huge role in my sport. I come to the competition with a bunch of different goggles and tons of different lenses in multiple tints. The weather can always be changing, and you have to have the right thing to make sure you can see perfectly.","I get to experience so much in my life as I travel around, and it's just such a great way to get to share that with people. All these sites, like Twitter and Make It Pro, give me such a very strong way to interact with people. It's easy to let people be part of your life and to keep all of your friends and fans together.","Everyone has different things they like in terms of board setup. The grind of the board and how it's waxed - you want to make sure that the speed of the board is right for the conditions of the halfpipe. And then there's the edges and the bevel of the edge.","When I first started snowboarding, nobody trained off-hill. People weren't going to the gym and getting stronger. Snowboarding was more self-expression, like skateboarding. It was just something you went and did. It wasn't something you trained for.","Jumping on the trampoline for even a half an hour is a really good workout. You get really tired. The next day, you're feeling it. And you really have to use your core. If you don't, your lower back hurts the next day.","When you're up on the hill, and you know you're as strong as you can be, you're more willing and able and confident to go and do bigger and harder and more technical tricks.","If you wake up in the morning, and you're feeling tired, I feel like if you get on your yoga mat and even practice for, like, 10 or 15 minutes, it's really great for just grounding you, centering you, and getting the energy moving.","From day one, snowboarding led me down a totally different path, and it's that path that's kept me laughing and continually intrigued. I love the satisfaction at the end of the day of overcoming my fears, of spending all day outside working hard, and there's nothing better than the feeling of landing a new trick for the first time.","I don't have too strict a diet.","Core training is so important.","There will always be another email to get through; something to clean up, file, and organize; more errands to do. Which is why balance is so important. Life is a marathon, not a sprint.","It takes energy to get energy.","With the new year comes a refueled motivation to improve on the past one.","I learned a few years ago that balance is the key to a happy and successful life, and a huge part of achieving that balance is to instill rituals into your everyday life - a nutritious balanced diet, daily exercise, time for yourself through meditation, reading, journaling, yoga, daily reflection, and setting goals.","More and more, companies are realizing the value of their female consumers, and that's showing up in the female-specific products they're making, their marketing strategies, and even the feel of their companies internally.","I've gotten to work with some amazing brands that, in many cases, market to female consumers.","Sometimes in life, when we really want something, we can approach it in a way that might actually be closing us off from achieving it.","Building up expectations, creating unrealistic time frames, feeling like our end goal is the end all, be all can all lead to frustration or anxiety. We end up feeling as though we have to power through what we want rather than enjoy the process and just let the result come as it may.","When you operate from a nothing-left-to-lose mentality, it's essentially the same thing as the 'Law of Least Resistance.' You have a goal in mind, but you're not emotionally attached to the outcome. You're focusing on all of the little steps inbetween.","When you find yourself hitting up against a wall over and over again, it's time to try a different route.","Snowboarding has really shaped the person I've become, and I consider every moment a good one because every one has led me to where I am now.","Change can be uncomfortable and scary. But I believe change exists to teach us to appreciate and enjoy the right now.","I'm a competitor, and since I was 2 years old, I have always wanted to be the best at whatever I was doing.","When I first started snowboarding, it was something that was only really done in the winter. Mount Hood in Oregon was the magical exception.","Mt. Hood is still one of my favorites for its sun, warmth, and slushy, forgiving conditions.","As pro snowboarders, skiers, etc., we all know that what we do is risky.","Our job as pros is to walk a very fine line: be the best but stay healthy so you can continue to progress and be at the top. You can't push the sport and yourself if you're always hurt.","Being at the top means never being satisfied with what you're comfortable with - comfortable means you've stopped pushing, and you're either going to get passed, or you already have been. But if you're constantly pushing yourself, then you're exposing yourself to falls and injuries.","Over the course of my 13-year career, I've had a lot of concussions, and yet, because I'm no longer competing or suffering from concussion symptoms, I felt like I was in the clear. The reality, though, is that I get concussions far more easily, and my symptoms last far longer than ever before.","From any traumatic injury, you're going to experience a lack of confidence. There's a whole process you have to go through to break free of that.","I'm a two-time Olympian, but ever since I was a little girl, the Olympic dream has influenced me.","It takes a village to earn a spot representing your country, and I know that every single person who helped me get to the Olympics was also touched by the dream. The web of inspiration is incredible. Because of this, I know that the core principles and spirit of what the Olympics stand for are worth protecting.","Meditating, even for a little bit, is better than nothing.","Meditation isn't necessarily this magical experience where we don't ever have thoughts.","When I win, I'm happy. When I lose, I'm also happy. I'm grateful for this life I have to live. It's a great life.","I grew up snowboarding in two of the best states for the sport: Colorado and Utah. The world-class ski mountains in these neighboring states were key factors that allowed me to represent our country in two Olympics and numerous X Games.","Climate change poses a far greater threat to the outdoor industry than even the privatization of the public lands.","I typically have breakfast, have a snack, have lunch, have a snack, and have dinner.","I like eating small meals frequently throughout the day, it helps me keep up my metabolism and get more out of my training.","We need more balance in the world - more balance of the feminine and the masculine.","When you start to find balance, then you start to ask more important questions, like, 'Who am I really?' That's when you start seeing that every single person around you is a human being just doing the best that they can.","It took me a long time to figure out how to deal with pressure.","The first few years I was competing, I'd ride so well in practice, then choke and fall in competition. Now I take a deep breath and say, 'Look at me. I'm outside. I'm doing what I love.' Still, nothing's matched the pressure I felt standing at the top of the halfpipe for the first time at the Olympics.","I'm very competitive.","It sucks. When you're a woman in sports, people want you to show some skin.","It's okay to feel nervous before a competition because it means you care about doing well.","I run on the beach, surf, and bike.","Have a specific goal every time you hit the gym; this way, your workouts have built-in purpose.","The programs I do with my trainer are amazing for overall strength and have a major focus on building my core. We do a lot of unique exercises that shake up the nervous system, which builds my balance and propreception. That's really important for my sport.","If you take minutes a day to take care of your mouth, the odds are you'll take the next steps needed to take care of your whole body, like exercising and eating healthy. It's a building block for other healthy habits.","As a professional snowboarder, my goal is to educate and create awareness around the issues we're facing with climate change.","While everyone's purpose may be different, with social media we all have that platform to create the change we want to see in the world, and I spend a lot of time encouraging others to step up and use theirs.","What most people don't realize is that in snowboarding, there are two different aspects: the filming side and the competition side. The filming side is when snowboarders spend the entire winter season trying to document the best, most progressive and innovative riding of the year.","The Olympics have always been very special to me.","Getting older, getting married, buying a house, becoming a different person... I had to figure out what my new motivations, inspirations, and goals were.","I've always had bigger legs and butt; it's just the way I'm built. Over time, I realized that they were blessings because that foundation - my legs and butt - is what helps me flip 12 feet above an icy halfpipe.","Being involved in sports, you think less about how your body looks and more how it performs.","Eliminate the energy vampires in your house. Connect all of your appliances to power strips and turn them off they're when not in use.","Walk, skateboard, bike, car pool, or use mass transit more, and drive less.","Get a composter and let nature breakdown your compostable trash and use the remains as mulch for your plants.","After the Winter Olympics in 2006, I realized I had a platform to speak about causes that were important to me - and people would listen.","As a professional snowboarder, my livelihood obviously depends on snow. And for me, traveling around the world, chasing the snow, I see the effects of climate change first hand. You can tell the difference.","I love how snowboarding is like no other sport out there - I mean, some of my best friends are my biggest competitors. And we just cheer each other on. It's a very supportive sport.","Every year, I push myself to do something different - and push the boundaries a little bit more.","I partnered with Mission: it's a really cool company based on giving athletes what they need. I have my own signature lip balm because when I'm up on the hill, protecting your lips is so important.","If you're stressed at work, or before a competition, or if you need to be energized, or relaxed, there's so many scents that kind of take you there.","The Olympics, you're in front of the world, and yeah you're competing, but you want to look good. You want to have a great representation of who you are.","I care about the way I look, and I want to look my best. My regime isn't crazy. For my face, it's just sunscreen because foundations and tinted moisturizers rub against my neck warmer. But I do like eyeliner, mascara, and a little color on my lids.","I want to keep snowboarding as long as I'm still having fun and progressing my riding.","When I started snowboarding, I was looking for success to bring me identity. I still love to win, but at the same time, I don't need the X-Games to show me who I am.","I'm a Midwestern girl; I was born in Toledo, Ohio, and grew up in Dayton until I was ten years old. Then my whole life changed.","My family moved to Aspen, Colorado, where we had 'Avalanche Danger' days that kept us from going to school, climbed 14,000-foot peaks as part of my education, and I learned to snowboard.","Growing up with brothers, I've always been a very competitive person and also very involved in sports. So when I was younger, whatever sport I was involved in, I wanted to go to the Olympics for that!","When you choose to take the road less traveled, it can sometimes be a bumpy ride along the way, but if you're doing it for the right reasons, then the reward is so great.","When I first started snowboarding, there weren't a lot of girl riders on the hill.","What snowboarding has always had and the Olympics has not touched is that spirit, that original spirit of creativity and athletes standing up and having a voice and being innovative. But I guess what the Olympics has done is provided a platform for that spirit, and that's what I see as being a really positive thing.","I've landed on my shoulders a lot of times, and separated them and stretched the capsule. I've torn my ACL in my right knee; that took me out for an entire season.","I think snowboarders have a unique experience when it comes to the Olympics because we have a pretty frequent competition circuit in addition to the games. So it's not a sport where your big moment is just once every four years.","You've made the time to go to the gym, so don't just go through the motions.","I work out hard; that way, I can eat whatever I want. If you have a hard time regulating your diet, pushing yourself at the gym will help you keep the pounds off.","When you feel the burn, that's when you know you're doing an exercise correctly. If you're doing 20 crunches, and you're not struggling, make an adjustment so they're harder to do. Don't cheat yourself. If it isn't burning, you're not getting stronger.","I'm on the road a lot, but I eat healthy whenever I can with foods that don't contain pesticides.","I'm a two-time Olympian, but on the front and back end of both of those were two Olympics where I narrowly missed making the team.","I remember being glued to the TV as I watched the Olympics as a kid. There was something so magical, almost otherworldly, about the Olympics. My favorite part was that moment right before it all started. The moment where the athlete would stand up ready to face whatever lay ahead.","I have at least one goal that I work toward each day. It's all about taking hold of the day rather than letting the day run you.","I love dried mangoes, walnuts, and goji berries. The mix provides iron, antioxidants, and omega-3s and really kicks up my energy.","Lots of times, people go to the mountains and feel like it's not cool to wear a beanie and goggles and neck gaiter. But you're so much more comfortable, and you're getting the protection you need.","Mission makes athlete-specific products. I always use their sunscreen - it's an anti-sting formula, which is huge for me because it doesn't burn my eyes when I'm snowboarding in warmer temperatures.","If you don't snowboard a lot, then it's a good idea to go to the gym before you get up on those mountains to make for a better experience. Lots of core exercises and squats and lunges would help work the muscles you'll be using."],"Gretchen Carlson":["Be brave and be fearless, and for God's sake, stand up for yourself.","It's so unbelievable that in 2017, almost every single woman has a story about sexual harassment.","Holding true to what you believe - even in a big city - is so important.","Trust is the most important aspect of being a journalist. If people don't trust or find you relatable - you will not have success.","I believe giving back is one of the greatest life lessons we can teach our children: that the world isn't all about them and that, through our actions, people will really discover what kind of a person we truly are.","All women deserve a dignified and respectful workplace in which talent, hard work and loyalty are recognized, revered, and rewarded.","I'm ready to move on to the next chapter of my life in which I will redouble my efforts to empower women in the workplace.","Sometimes when women come forward about sexual harassment, they're seen as a troublemaker.","I never expected to be the face of sexual harassment. But I never give up on anything. So when placed in a new, challenging situation, it's like, 'I'm going to give this 110% because that's what I've done my entire life.'","I'm a huge believer in visualizing achieving the task before it happens.","The minute that you go to arbitration, it's 100% confidential, so nobody ever hears about it.","There are no guarantees in life, but I believe faith provides all of us with a foundation to live the best lives possible - knowing that there is a higher being who loves us and will never leave us. Through the many struggles in my life, my faith is sometimes the only thing I have to hold onto. God was my only friend.","I'm setting up a fund to empower girls and women to speak up - on all issues, not just sexual harassment. For me, it's about inspiring women to come together.","Even though we have laws against it and HR departments to handle it, a woman - especially if she is young and just starting out - can never be sure that reporting harassment won't hurt her career.","I actually always say that I have a son and a daughter, but I work more for my son, because I want him to respect women when he gets into the real world like he respects his mom right now.","My grandfather was the minister at the Lutheran church. My dad owned a car dealership in town. My mom was the consummate volunteer and cheerleader for me.","A lot of things I've done in my life have taken incredible mental fortitude.","Arbitration clauses have become prevalent in most corporate agreements or contracts for employees.","We need more women in higher roles, because the tone for sexual harassment would no doubt be different.","I grew up thinking that I could be anything I wanted to be in this world because my mom told me that every single night.","I wanted to play the piano.","Becoming Miss America was one of those things. It immediately changed what I thought I was going to do with the rest of my life.","I think one of the things I've learned is that the tone of an organization is set from the top down. And if you have men running an organization that want to honor women, that's a whole different experience than if they don't.","I respond to every email. I sign every autograph for every person.","Half of the equation is men, and right now, unfortunately, men are running the majority of corporations, so we have to make sure that if that is the case, that they are respectful and honor women for their true accomplishments.","I've been for women's empowerment my entire life.","I am saddened by the prevalence of powerful men disrespecting and objectifying women - and getting away with it for years.","I am particularly distressed when people in the public eye who influence our culture perpetuate sexism.","My vibrato was my weakness. With romantic pieces, I could be a lot more schmaltzy. My wider vibrato fit that.","Everyone knew how powerful Roger Ailes was. I certainly felt intimidated by that; the culture of 'Fox and Friends' was intimidating to me.","I wish some days that I didn't have as much drive as I do. I'd sleep better.","I've always been an incredibly strong person, and I've also been underestimated.","I've been truly blessed to have so many supporters and, of course, blessed to have my family and all my friends.","I have strived to empower women and girls throughout my entire career.","I am extremely proud of my accomplishments at 'Fox News' and for keeping our loyal viewers engaged and informed on events and news topics of the day.","A lot of people who have come up to me at restaurants - men - and have said, 'I want to shake your hand, because I have daughters'.","I defend CNN! I defend all sorts of people when I think it's wrong.","My parents raised me with a never-give-up attitude, telling me I could be anything I wanted to be. I was a serious violinist and a valedictorian of my high school class. I knew all about hard work.","Men need to hire more women and put them in higher positions of power within organizations.","Let's teach our girls and boys how to show the same respect to their colleagues in the workplace they show their moms and sisters at home.","The assault weapon ban in this country should be reinstated.","I've reinvented myself many times in my life. I thought I'd become a concert violinist but burned out at 17. I thought I'd go to law school but became Miss America.","One of the most important things to do is to raise our kids in a respectful way with both genders.","In our society, people look at women who are tenacious, smart, attractive, and talented and for whatever reason say, 'There must be something wrong with that equation. She couldn't possibly be all of those things at once.'","A lot of stories that aren't true get out into the mainstream, and it's hard to correct that. People want to hear what they already believe.","I do think we need to find common ground on some of these major issues facing our nation.","We need a woman in the White House right now. I really think that women want to work together.","Maybe it's because I'm short and blond, but people have really underestimated me.","During the time I was Miss America, I had come to New York City because I had decided I wanted to try to get into television.","I cling to the hope that with more and more women in the workplace, we can teach younger generations to be respectful and also encourage young women to speak up when they've experienced abuse.","Once I turned 40, I stopped giving a rip about my detractors, the people who say nasty things. It's more candid and honest than it would have been. I share my failures, which is important.","Sexual harassment can really affect you for a long time, and I want more women to come forward.","After I won Miss America, I called my dad, who had four kids in college, to say he no longer had to pay for Stanford.","The political scenario has gotten so divisive - not only in Washington, D.C., but across the country, too.","Life is about compromise - in relationships and at work.","When people don't want to debate you on the smart issues of the day, it's just a lot easier to call you a dumb blonde from Fox.","When people watch me on TV, they see part of my life. I wanted to let them know the real me behind the scenes. The child who was a concert violinist from the age of six. The young woman who took on the challenge to compete in the Miss America pageant. The television journalist for twenty-five years.","Nothing was ever handed to me. My hope is that when people read my story, it will inspire them to reach for their goals and not give up. The real story is this: if I can do it, you can, too.","If you Google me, you'll find plenty of 'dumb blonde' references - even though I graduated with honors from Stanford and studied at Oxford University. I don't let it bother me.","Sometimes people look at television personalities and say, 'Wow, they've never had any problems.' And I really wanted people to know that hadn't been my path. I want people to know the real me underneath.","I always wanted to have a really successful career, but I always wanted to be a mom, too.","Hearing that I had a 3 percent chance of ever having kids was one of the more devastating moments in my life.","We like to say Miss America is the classy one. It has a talent category. I would have been dead last in Miss USA - I'm five foot three, I'm not a model, and I never wanted to be one.","For all of you out there who don't know what 'ignoramus' is, it's an ignorant lawyer.","I wanted to see how much of an insult it was to be called an ignoramus. I didn't know what it meant; I just Googled it.","One week after getting married in my thirties - while I was working as the main anchor at the CBS affiliate in Cleveland, Ohio - I got fired.","My career had zero to do with whether or not my husband also worked. It had everything to do with personal identity, personal goals, and making the most of my life.","I didn't win Class President in tenth grade. I was too chubby to win a role in the school play 'Oklahoma!' and I didn't make it into a singing and dancing group in high school for the same reason - too fat.","My advice to people who've lost their job: go back to the things that made you from the start.","The future is wide open. I may actually go back and get that law degree someday.","I might even pursue a career in politics. If I do, I will have had great practice dealing with the avalanche of daily criticism from working at Fox News and being a former Miss America. I'm ready for anything!","We all remember growing up with mean girls, right?","One of my proudest moments in life was earning the valedictorian medal in high school. I worked so hard for it!","I wasn't naive, but at the end of my Miss America year, when two different executives attacked me during what I thought were informational interviews about jobs, I was shocked. I didn't see it coming, and the worst thing about it was the shame I felt, as if I'd done something wrong.","I took off the makeup and stashed the crown, and now I was just another young woman out in the world. It's almost dizzying how fast the fame goes away - like a stage that turns dark at the end of a performance.","During my whole year as Miss America and afterward, I was calling agents, looking for advice and opportunities. When I was in New York or in Los Angeles doing different appearances, if I had time on my schedule, I tried to meet with executives.","To this day, I have an open door policy. I seek out interns and young women and try to help them. Women mentors were important to me, and I want to do that for others.","I wasn't prepared for the environment I encountered trying to break into television news. In the world of music, where I spent my formative years, we were judged solely on our talent, and gender wasn't a factor.","I know, normally folks on TV wouldn't readily admit their age, but since there's nothing you can do about it, you might as well own it and be happy."],"Gretchen Mol":["The interesting thing about Bettie Page that I discovered was to leave the mystery. She always retained a little mystery. Let there be some unknowns.","People were always able to look at Bettie Page and see what they needed her to be and she gave them that permission to do so. So in that way she's a feminist but I don't think she was ever trying to be.","It's not like I have a master plan or anything.","It's hard to know really how it's going to happen, but the career ebbs and flows and now there's a nicer feeling of interest than there has been at other times.","I think it's sort of disrespectful to the partner you're having sex with to talk about it.","I think because I've maintained my residence in New York, those kinds of films have been more accessible.","I haven't had to do too many, or many explicit ones. Everybody feels weird, and everybody is trying to tiptoe around and make you think they're not there. The last time I did a love scene, I couldn't keep a straight face.","I focused on where she was from of course, her voice and her history, her relationship with God - her religion. This was probably the strongest relationship she has had, really. She never seemed to maintain close relationships with husbands.","I began thinking I would do musical theater because in high school that was really the only sort of curriculum they had as far as getting onstage and doing anything that anybody would see. So that's what I did.","Hopefully, I'll just get to be part of good films and work with good people, and that's how it will develop.","Donnie Brasco was great, but the energy on the set made it kinda hard to get in there and have an opinion."],"Gretchen Parlato":["You want to have a feeling when you sing that you just love singing; you love the feeling of singing, and you love this feeling of this voice coming out of your body into this world. It's about really getting that most beautiful, pure, centered tone, thinking about the story of each song and the lyrics, and connecting your own life to that story.","For me, the best way to be as an artist is to be completely yourself, letting that vulnerability come through.","As an artist, what you do represents who you are. Coming from a genuine, honest place - that's what I'm trying to do.","If I could sing like a Chaka Khan, an Aretha, a Kim Burrell, if I could do all these amazing runs and belt it out, I would. I've attempted that, and it's not something anyone would want to hear.","You always have to be ready. When I'm washing dishes, I have to have a towel ready so I can dry my hands and push the record button on my phone.","It's really fun to get into that process of creating an album and telling a story. I really love it.","It's like, whenever I do any kind of cover, if it's a jazz piece or pop cover, I want to honor the original and make sure that the bulk and the juice of what makes that so great is there, but take it to a different place.","The meditative, calm sound is a reflection of my personality. I've got a silly and a crazy side, but it makes sense the music would come across that way. I do yoga every day and try to keep a sense of peace and calm in my life. I don't have a lot of frantic energy.","I always used to say I'm definitely not a straight-ahead jazz singer, because then there's people who would hear what I do and say, 'Is it jazz? I don't know...' Whatever it is, it really comes down to creating music that makes people feel something.","Having artist parents, they knew the importance of exposing me and my sister to all types of music and art and making art part of our every day. it was just always there.","I've always surrounded myself with other artists. My close friends, people I've been in relationships with - I went to an arts high school - even my elementary school was arts based.","Ultimately, I think there's this umbrella term of jazz, and what's cool about not just what's happening with my music but this general sense of what's happening with this generation of musicians, is it's a very broad term, and we can incorporate all types of music, and we can be influenced and inspired by all kinds of sounds.","I might sound like the weird artist hippy girl or whatever, but I don't have a complaint about what jazz is or what I'm doing with music. And that's more of a philosophy on my life. I could find things that maybe could shift or change, but ultimately, it's like that's not a good way to live our lives and think about what we do.","I feel like I was always singing. Since I could speak, I could sing. It came very naturally. In school, I was always singing in choruses and choirs. I always loved to sing; it was something to fun to do.","It's fun to use all of my range; there are so many different colors and textures that come out, revealing different parts of my voice. I know what my voice is capable of, and I try to fit it to each song, evoke a mood.","I don't sing very loud, which some people have given me trouble about, but we all have to figure out what our voices are, embrace that."],"Gretchen Rubin":["One of the best ways to make yourself happy in the present is to recall happy times from the past. Photos are a great memory-prompt, and because we tend to take photos of happy occasions, they weight our memories to the good.","Nature is impersonal, awe-inspiring, elegant, eternal. It's geometrically perfect. It's tiny and gigantic. You can travel far to be in a beautiful natural setting, or you can observe it in your backyard - or, in my case, in the trees lining New York City sidewalks, or in the clouds above skyscrapers.","Negative emotions like loneliness, envy, and guilt have an important role to play in a happy life; they're big, flashing signs that something needs to change.","Turn off your email; turn off your phone; disconnect from the Internet; figure out a way to set limits so you can concentrate when you need to, and disengage when you need to. Technology is a good servant but a bad master.","I have a lucky perfume. I love beautiful smells, but I save one of my favorite perfumes to wear only when I feel like I need some extra luck.","Being taken for granted is an unpleasant but sincere form of praise. Ironically, the more reliable you are, and the less you complain, the more likely you are to be taken for granted.","Superstition is the irrational belief that an object or behavior has the power to influence an outcome, when there's no logical connection between them. Most of us aren't superstitious - but most of us are a 'littlestitious.'","Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Lower the bar. Actually spending ten minutes clearing off one shelf is better than fantasizing about spending a weekend cleaning out the basement.","Keep in mind that to avoid loneliness, many people need both a social circle and an intimate attachment. Having just one of two may still leave you feeling lonely.","The days are long, but the years are short.","It's hard to avoid 'unconscious overclaiming.' In unconscious overclaiming, we unconsciously overestimate our contributions relative to others. This makes sense, because we're far more aware of what we do than what other people do. Also, we tend to do the work that we value.","Habit allows us to go from 'before' to 'after,' to make life easier and better. Habit is notorious - and rightly so - for its ability to direct our actions, even against our will; but by mindfully shaping our habits, we can harness the power of mindlessness as a sweeping force for serenity, energy, and growth.","In the scope of a happy life, a messy desk or an overstuffed coat closet is a trivial thing, yet I find - and I hear from other people that they agree - that getting rid of clutter gives a disproportionate boost to happiness.","Happiness is a critical factor for work, and work is a critical factor for happiness. In one of those life-isn't-fair results, it turns out that the happy outperform the less happy. Happy people work more hours each week - and they work more in their free time, too.","If you're impatient while waiting for the bus, tell yourself you're doing 'Bus waiting meditation.' If you're standing in a slow line at the drugstore, you're doing 'Waiting in line meditation.' Just saying these words makes me feel very spiritual and high-minded and wise.","Watching TV is companionable: you share an experience, you can comment on the action here and there for a bit of conversation... it's a way of showing someone that you want his or her company and engaging in a low-key, pleasant, undemanding way.","Working is one of the most dangerous forms of procrastination.","It's so easy to use tired, shopworn figures of speech. I love using long, fancy words but have learned - mostly from writing my biography of Winston Churchill - that short, strong words work better. I am ever-vigilant against the passive and against jargon, both of which are so insidious.","A series of small but real accomplishments gives people the energy and confidence to continue. For instance, a person who wants to write a novel might resolve to write one sentence each day. Or a person who wants to start running might resolve to run for one minute.","As goofy as it sounds, I try to sing in the morning. It's hard both to sing and to maintain a grouchy mood, and it sets a happy tone for everyone - particularly in my case, because I'm tone deaf, and my audience finds my singing a source of great hilarity.","Each week, I post a video about some 'Pigeon of Discontent' raised by a reader. Because, as much as we try to find the 'Bluebird of Happiness,' we're also plagued by those small but pesky 'Pigeons of Discontent.'","No leader did more for his country than Winston Churchill. Brave, magnanimous, traditional, he was like a king-general from Britain's heroic past. His gigantic qualities set him apart from ordinary humanity; there seemed no danger he feared, no effort too great for his limitless energies.","One thing I wish I could tell my younger self: take photos of everyday life, not special occasions; later, that's what will be interesting to you.","I'm always trying to figure out ways to keep hold of memories. My one-sentence journal, for instance.","One major challenge within happiness is loneliness. The more I've learned about happiness, the more I've come to believe that loneliness is a terrible, common, and important obstacle to consider.","I get such a buzz out of cleaning closets.","Some kind of clutter is difficult - letting go of things with sentimental value, sifting through papers - but some clutter I find very refreshing to clear. I drive my daughters nuts because I'm always wandering into their rooms to clear clutter.","The biggest waste of time is to do well something that we need not do at all.","Don't keep excessive amounts of anything. Those glass vases that come from florists. Those ketchup packets that come with take-out food. A house with two adults probably doesn't need fifteen mismatched souvenir coffee cups.","A 'treat' is different from a 'reward,' which must be justified or earned. A treat is a small pleasure or indulgence that we give to ourselves just because we want it. Treats give us greater vitality, which boosts self-control, which helps us maintain our healthy habits.","Now, the term 'friend' is a little loose. People mock the 'friending' on social media, and say, 'Gosh, no one could have 300 friends!' Well, there are all kinds of friends. Those kinds of 'friends,' and work friends, and childhood friends, and dear friends, and neighborhood friends, and we-walk-our-dogs-at-the-same-time friends, etc.","Often, if there's something that I want to do, but somehow can't get myself to do, it's because I don't have clarity. This lack of clarity often arises from a feeling of ambivalence - I want to do something, but I don't want to do it; or I want one thing, but I also want something else that conflicts with it.","Getting paperwork under control makes me feel more in control of my life generally.","We can use decision-making to choose the habits we want to form, use willpower to get the habit started, then - and this is the best part - we can allow the extraordinary power of habit to take over. At that point, we're free from the need to decide and the need to use willpower.","I do better with routines and predictability. I don't react well when there's a sudden change in the schedule.","The more I examine the issue of clutter, the more effort I put into combating it, because it really does act as a weight.","I love taxonomies, categories, ways of dividing people into groups.","Although we often assume that feelings inspire actions, in fact, actions also inspire feelings. By pushing myself to act happier, I make myself feel happier.","When we don't get any treats, we feel depleted, resentful, and angry, and we feel justified in self-indulgence. We start to crave comfort - and grab that comfort wherever we can, even if it means breaking good habits.","If you'd like to watch less television, try putting the remote away in a very inconvenient place and making yourself put it away every time you use it. If it's a big pain to turn on the TV and to change channels, you might find yourself drifting to other activities that will be more satisfying in the long run.","If you've had something for more than six months, and it's still not repaired, it's clutter.","Like most people, I have several pet subjects - that may or may not be interesting to other people. Don't get me started on happiness, or habits, or children's literature, or Winston Churchill, unless you really want to talk about it.","During my study of happiness, I noticed something that surprised me: I often learn more from one person's highly idiosyncratic experiences than I do from sources that detail universal principles or cite up-to-date studies.","They say that people teach what they need to learn. By adopting the role of happiness teacher, if only for myself, I was trying to find the method to conquer my particular faults and limitations.","I embrace treats, but I'm also very wary of treats. Treats help us feel energized, appreciated, and enthusiastic - but very often, the things we choose as 'treats' aren't good for us. The pleasure lasts a minute, but then feelings of guilt, loss of control, and other negative consequences just deepen the lousiness of the day.","My writing tends to become very dense, so I have to keep some cushion. Sometimes, words that seem superfluous are actually essential for the overall effect.","Whenever I'm trying to decide how to spend my precious time, energy, or money, I ask myself a series of questions. 'Will this broaden or deepen my relationships?' 'Will this contribute to an atmosphere of growth in my life?' 'Is this a way to 'Be Gretchen?' and 'Will this help connect me to my past?'","Sometimes, counter-intuitively, it's easier to make a major change than a minor change. When a habit is changing very gradually, we may lose interest, give way under stress, or dismiss the change as insignificant. There's an excitement and an energy that comes from a big transformation, and that helps to create a habit.","I'm a compulsive note-taker, and I used to feel self-conscious about pulling out my little notebook and taking notes during a casual conversation. Then I noticed that people really seemed to enjoy it; the fact that I was taking notes made their remarks seem particularly insightful or valuable. Now I don't hold myself back.","Never label anything 'Miscellaneous.'","A person with 'oppositional conversational style' is a person who, in conversation, disagrees with and corrects whatever you say. He or she may do this in a friendly way, or a belligerent way, but this person frames remarks in opposition to whatever you venture.","I collect axioms, paradoxes, maxims, teaching stories, proverbs, and aphorisms of all sorts, because I love to see complex ideas distilled into a few words.","Whenever I start a new book, I think, 'This is the most interesting subject of all time. It's sad, I'll never enjoy writing another book as much as I enjoy this one.' Every time, I'm convinced. And then I change my mind when I start the next book.","It's easier to get rid of things when you're giving them to someone who can use them, but don't let this kind intention become a source of clutter itself. I have a friend who has multiple piles all over her house, each lovingly destined for a particular recipient.","Do I need fifty finger-painted pictures by my toddler, or is one enough to capture this time of life? Mementos work best when they're carefully chosen - and when they don't take up much room!","One of my 'Secrets of Adulthood' is: Somewhere, keep an empty shelf. I know where my empty shelf is, and I treasure it.","Many people keep photos in their homes, in their office, or in their wallet, and happy families tend to display large numbers of photos at home. In 'Happier at Home,' I write about my 'shrine to my family' made of photographs.","Work done by other people sounds easy. How hard can it be to take care of a newborn who sleeps 20 hours a day? How hard can it be to keep track of your billable hours? To travel for one night for business? To get a 4-year-old ready for school? To return a few phone calls? To load the dishwasher? To fill out some forms?","Often, the more reliably you perform a task, the less likely it is for someone to notice that you're doing it and to feel grateful and to feel any impulse to help or to take a turn.","I'm much calmer when there's no TV or music playing in the background.","One of my most important 'Secrets of Adulthood': Outer order contributes to inner calm.","In 'Happier at Home,' I write a lot about my struggle to create an unhurried atmosphere at home.","For quotes, I have one document for general quotes; the other for happiness-related quotes, which I use for the 'Moment of Happiness,' my daily emails of happiness quotes.","For notes related to books I'm writing, I've wondered whether I should organize my notes better, but I do find that the action or scrolling through them and seeing odd juxtapositions of ideas helps to stimulate my own ideas and creativity. I worry that if I kept the notes in a highly-structured way, I might lose some of these benefits.","While television is a good servant, it's a bad master. It can swallow up huge quantities of our lives without much happiness bang for the buck.","An enormous amount of ingenuity and creativity goes into commercials, and they can be fascinating if you pay attention.","I always feel calmer when I exercise. In fact, that's probably the main reason I exercise.","Try to never say 'yes' on the phone; instead, say, 'I'll get back to you.' When you're actually speaking to someone, the desire to be accommodating is very strong, and can lead you to say 'yes' without enough consideration.","Take care of difficult calls or emails as quickly as possible. Procrastinating just makes it harder; getting them done gives a big boost of relieved energy.","When accepting a responsibility, imagine that it's something that you'll have to do next week. That way you don't agree to something just because it seems so far off that it doesn't seem onerous.","People are powerfully moved by imagination, belief, and knowledge. They can consider the past and future. They can make changes in their behavior out of reason in a way that animals can't do.","I really work on paying attention to the clues my self is giving myself. For instance, I think of myself in the third person. That allows me to manage myself better.","Children's literature is one of my joys, and it's also my mental comfort food.","Embrace good smells. No cost, no calories, no energy, no time - a quick hit of pleasure.","Accept yourself and expect more from yourself.","Give warm greetings and farewells. I was surprised by how much this resolution changed the atmosphere of my home.","One of my key realizations about happiness, and a point oddly under-emphasized by positive psychologists, given its emphasis in popular culture, is that outer order contributes to inner calm. More than it should.","I love cunning containers as much as anyone, but I've found that if I get rid of everything I don't need, I often don't need a container at all.","You can love someone but not want to keep a gift from that person. It's okay to pass an item along to someone who will appreciate it more.","Don't let yourself fall into 'empty.' Keep cash in the house. Keep gas in your tank. Keep an extra roll of toilet paper squirreled away. Keep your phone charged.","Growing up in Kansas City, I was always neat, the teacher's pet, know-it-all type.","I'd always vaguely expected to outgrow my limitations. One day, I'd stop twisting my hair, and wearing running shoes all the time, and eating exactly the same food every day. I'd remember my friends' birthdays, I'd learn Photoshop, I wouldn't let my daughter watch TV during breakfast. I'd read Shakespeare.","Most decisions don't require extensive research.","People often assume that the same approach will work for everyone, that the same habits will work for everyone, and that everyone has the same aptitude and appetite for forming habits, but from my observation, that's not true.","If I can do something in less than one minute, I don't let myself procrastinate. I hang up my coat, put newspapers in the recycling, scan and toss a letter. Ever since I wrote about this rule in 'The Happiness Project,' I've been amazed by how many people have told me that it has made a huge difference in their lives.","It was my interest in happiness that led me to the subject of habits, and of course, the study of habits is really the study of happiness. Habits are the invisible architecture of everyday life, and a significant element of happiness.","For one person, organized files might be a crucial tool for creativity; another person finds inspiration in random juxtapositions.","When you're doing a job that benefits other people, it's easy to assume that they feel conscious of the fact that you're doing this work - that they should feel grateful, and that they should and do feel guilty about not helping you.","If you want someone else to do a task, don't do it yourself.","When we're trying to form and keep habits, we often search - even unconsciously - for loopholes. We look for justifications that will excuse us from keeping this particular habit in this particular situation.","We need to have intimate, enduring bonds; we need to be able to confide; we need to feel that we belong; we need to be able to get support, and just as important for happiness, to give support. We need many kinds of relationships; for one thing, we need friends.","I love finding - or inventing - ways to categorize people.","'Potato-chip news' is news that's repetitive, requires little effort to absorb, and is consumable in massive quantities: true crime, natural disasters, political punditry, celebrity gossip, sports gossip, or endless photographs of beautiful houses, food, or clothes.","Most people enjoy 'potato-chip news' from time to time - to track a presidential election or the Oscars. However, some are particularly drawn to material that makes them feel shocked, frightened, insecure, or indignant, and that's what potato-chip news often provides.","Spending hours stressed out in front of the TV isn't the same as volunteering or donating. Feeling a high level of personal distress makes people feel agitated and emotionally drained, to the point that they lack the energy or detachment to help - or the energy to manage themselves.","One thing that makes me very happy is to have a complicated idea and to feel that I've expressed myself clearly. I remember writing the ending to 'Happier at Home.' I wrote the entire book to build to that ending 'now is now,' and what I had to say was very abstract, and yet I felt satisfied that I managed to say what I wanted to say.","Remember that although the distinction can be difficult to draw, loneliness and solitude are different.","In 'Before and After,' I identify the sixteen strategies that we can use to make or break our habits. Some are quite familiar, such as 'Monitoring,' 'Scheduling,' and 'Convenience.' Some took me a lot of effort to identify, such as 'Thinking,' 'Identity,' and 'Clarity.'","I've always loved 'Before and After' stories, in books, magazines, and TV shows. Whenever I read those words, I'm hooked. The thought of a transformation - any kind of transformation - thrills me. And that's the promise of habits.","I have a terrible memory of my own past. I can barely remember my childhood. I have few memories from college and law school - though once I got married, I got the advantage of being able to consult my husband's memory.","Keeping a habit, in the smallest way, protects and strengthens it. I write every day, even if it's just a sentence, to keep my habit of daily writing strong.","Enthusiasm is a form of social courage.","Skillful conversationalists can explore disagreements and make points in ways that feel constructive and positive rather than combative or corrective.","Putting myself into categories is fun, and I think it also gives me insight into my own nature. When I see myself more clearly, I can more easily see ways that I might do things differently, to make myself happier. Categories can be unhelpful, however, when they become too all-defining, or when they become an excuse.","I've found that I snack less and concentrate better when I chew on a plastic stirrer - the kind that you get to stir your to-go coffee. I picked up this habit from my husband, who loves to chew on things. His favorite chew-toy is a plastic pen top, and gnawed pen tops and little bits of plastic litter our apartment.","I read a lot, all the time, but often I read books for research, or because they're interesting to me in some way, even if they aren't exactly 'pleasurable.'","We all want to get along well with other people, and one way to do this is to help people feel good about themselves. If you make a person feel smart and insightful, that person will enjoy your company.","One of the most important elements of my identity is my identity as a reader. I love to read - really, if I'm honest with myself, it's practically the only activity that I truly love to do.","When Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's government fell in May 1940, the nation turned to Churchill. At last, his unique qualities were brought to bear on a supreme challenge, and with his unshakable optimism, his heroic vision, and above all, his splendid speeches, Churchill roused the spirit of the British people.","I'm constantly on the hunt for insights about happiness or ideas about how to be happier - which probably makes me a somewhat tiresome companion at times.","Take the perspective of a journalist or scientist. Really study what's around you. What are people wearing, what do the interiors of buildings look like, what noises do you hear? If you bring your analytical powers to bear, you can make almost anything interesting.","When I became obsessed with Winston Churchill, I wrote a book about Churchill. What a joy it was to write that book!","Kennedy was president for only 1,037 days, but during his short tenure, he achieved much. At the Cold War's most dangerous hour, he preserved the peace. He improved relations with the Soviet Union and replaced tension over Berlin with a limited test ban treaty."],"Gretchen Wilson":["Mothers and daughters have that rivalry thing.","I don't really think about having had a hard life. It was just my life, and it's all I knew. It made me who I am - all the good and bad - and it's where all of the songs on Here For The Party came from. I've lived them all.","To me, redneck is a sense of self and a way of life.","What I'm doing is a dream come true but at the same time its work. It's like anything else. The only time it doesn't really feel like work to me is when I'm on stage and doing what I've prepared myself for my whole life which is to stand out in front of a crowd and sing.","I got to where I couldn't listen to country radio. Country music is supposed to have steel and fiddle. When I hear country music, it should be country.","People ask me where I go to get away, and I say 'Home.'","I just like Raisin Bran - it keeps me regular.","All my life, I just felt that I should have finished my education.","I don't want to be ignorant in my daughter's eyes.","I still fit in with the hillbillies!","I've always been the kind of woman who had a man in her life even when he was the wrong man.","My daughter is a redneck woman, she's a redneck girl.","I'm a mom first, a singer second.","Good music is good music.","Today, if you were to look at my CD collection, it might scare some people.","I think music can heal your soul if you'll let it. It can also bring you up if you're down. It can also bring you down if you're too up. It's a mood thing."],"Grete Waitz":["I am about to get involved with the biggest cancer hospital in Norway. They are building a fitness center to work with patients. I will be a consultant.","One day you are happy and laughing and the next you are crying.","Another inspiration that has helped me get through has been Lance Armstrong's story. My cancer is not nearly as bad as his, but I believe in staying motivated and keeping as fit as you can.","Every day I spend time on the treadmill. I am walking faster, stronger and harder than I was two months ago.","For a couple of days after chemotherapy, food tastes really bland, even the best foods. I haven't been sick, but have been a little tired. I haven't lost any weight.","I am a private person and that has always been my personality.","I am living in Norway, where I am under the care of the best cancer doctor in Norway and I can be closer to my family.","I tried to keep it secret, but the story got into the newspapers. It was more difficult for my family, who couldn't understand why the media wouldn't leave me in peace.","In terms of fitness and battling through cancer, exercise helps you stay strong physically and mentally.","The worst injury I ever had was a stress fracture from running.","What Fred Lebow went through was an inspiration for me. You have to set goals for yourself.","You go into the disease as one person and come out of it as a different person. It has changed my perspective on everything. Things that used to upset me no longer do."],"Gretel Ehrlich":["People travel and hunt on the sea ice - in Alaska, they hunt in skin boats for bowhead whales; in Greenland, they hunt with dogsleds. The ice is their highway. The ice is also the ecosystem in which marine mammals and terrestrial animals such as polar bears exist.","What people don't understand about the Arctic is that this isn't just about those other people, those Eskimos that have nothing to do with us. The Arctic drives the climate of the whole globe.","In 2007, I received a National Geographic Expeditions Council grant to go around the top of the world and talk to Arctic people about how they've been impacted by climate change.","I started traveling in the Arctic in 1991, so I experienced the ice in winter and spring. The seasonal sea ice, it has a long season. It starts in September and ends in June.","Every footstep we take, every action has a consequence. We breathe in weather, but we breathe out CO2. We're responsible for weather and for climate."],"Grey Damon":["I've actually been asked once or twice if I had some Puerto Rican in me.","I don't really enjoy watching reality TV.","I think that there's not much point to being an actor if you're not enjoying it, so I try to be picky about roles I do like to go out for.","My ma and pa are both very artistic, so I suppose it's in my blood. But my ma's the one who was into theater and such. I owe my love of it to her. If she didn't drag me to small community workshops when I was a wee little lad or exposed me to anything artistic for that matter, I wouldn't be who I am today.","I think about the work I've landed, and I think to myself, 'If I never land a job again, I could still die happy.'"],"Grey DeLisle":["Many thanks for all of the love and good wishes sent our way from my friends out there in cartoon land... the only place where a nine month pregnant woman can still play a hot goth chick in a belly shirt!","I feel like my music is just an extension of my acting. I treat the songs like scenes that tell a story... it's very similar. My favorite thing is when cartoon fans show up to my live gigs! They are always the most kick-butt audience members 'cause they're not trying to act all cool like a lot of the music fans do! It's refreshing!!","I was always talking in weird voices from the time I was two. I guess I just found a way to keep doing it! I did get a degree in theater and took some voice-over classes... but most of it is just the same stuff I was doing as a kid!","I hardly ever watch my own work. I just end up picking myself apart! I can't even stand to hear myself on voicemail. the sound of my own voice is like nails on a chalkboard. The same goes for my records.","Somehow, it seems that the sadder a song is, the happier I feel. The release of emotions that many would label as 'negative' is actually a liberating process for me.","My favorite thing is when cartoon fans show up to my live gigs! They are always the most kick-butt audience members 'cause they're not trying to act all cool like a lot of the music fans do!","I did get a degree in theater and took some voice-over classes."],"Griffin Dunne":["New York means so much to people. If you're inclined to leave the nest, New York is where most people think they have to go, and it's been that way since the first skyscraper.","I've always been schizophrenic; I've never been interested in limiting myself.","I produced six movies with Amy Robinson since the very early '80s.","On every movie I've done as a director, I look at the producers and having done it, I don't envy them, at all.","As a director, I've been able to combine with what I've learned as an actor and as a producer: it melds quite nicely into what I feel like I should have been doing all along.","But I remember feeling as a producer I felt like the guy who called the caterer and got the band; I had to work the party while everybody else was having a good time.","My hunger and desperation, being an actor, an out of work actor - my memory of that is as fresh as an open wound.","Every movie is wildly different. So many of the problems are the same, but they take on different guises.","But at the same time, never having final cut before, I really learned an interesting thing for any studio executive who is reading this: that if a director has final cut, it's actually easier and more interesting to listen to notes.","I think we were the first picture to cut on Final Cut Pro. So we were the guinea pigs, because we got a deal on the system. But with that comes all sorts of technological problems I couldn't begin to describe.","If movies are set in New York, they really should be shot in New York.","I'm being told it saves money to shoot in Toronto, because of tax benefits, the crews are cheaper, but what I save in the bottom line, I lose in a million other ways.","In the '80s, I can't say that Amy and I were aware of an independent film community. We could only get a certain amount of money for our pictures, which made them low budget movies, but they were distributed through studios.","I came to New York to be an actor and I became a film producer first.","I only got to be able to act, because I gave myself a job as a producer.","And I like being able to go back and forth, and I don't really care if it's a small budget or big budget or studio or independent, as long as it's got a story that's compelling and there's enough money to make the picture.","I'm in five guilds; that's a lot of dues to pay. So I have to keep on working.","Documentaries have always inspired me in narrative filmmaking.","Although there was a screenplay, the actors never knew what questions I was going to ask them, and all of my character's voice-over narration and scenes were added after the fact.","It struck me that working digitally with a small crew, I could lay out a general plan for Famous and hope for mistakes which would create something more than satire and something less than truthful reality.","I met Steve McQueen once. Well, met isn't really the right word."],"Grimes":["The most valuable live thing for me is when people look like they're having a good time.","Miami is just really fun whenever I go there. It's like this post-apocalyptic Barbie world: everything is pink, and there're palm trees everywhere. But then there are also all these people in crazy sunglasses, warehouses with sick parties where all the girls are covered in spikes and black leather. It's a very weird place.","It's obviously funny to be a meme, so I could be down with it in that regard, but it also belittles one's art.","In America there's lot of cool cities, but in Canada there's, like, well, Vancouver, Toronto and Halifax may be cool, but they're so expensive. Montreal is the only city that's affordable but also has buses and culture.","If I'm a bad mood, I can't go on stage and smile.","When I first started out, I was making really slow, psychedelic ambient music because it was all I could do.","I feel like vocals are to music what portraits are to painting. They're the humanity. Landscapes are good and fine, but at the end of the day everyone loves the Mona Lisa.","You don't just have to be influenced by rock, or goth, anymore. It's okay to say, 'My influences are Tin Pan music from Bali and Rihanna.' There are still so many combinations that haven't been done yet.","I believe the human mind is a very fallible thing, but it's the only thing that I can really know, I guess.","I truly love 'Gangnam Style.' I guess it's a meme. I feel like it's one of the few times where the meme and the quality combines nicely.","By the time I'm 50, there is probably going to be a nuclear holocaust. I should just enjoy myself.","If you focus too much on development of the visual angle, it could be a detriment to what you're doing musically.","I don't think I know anyone who has a steady job in Montreal.","The way that you present yourself visually totally dictates your audience and everything that anyone thinks about you.","I went through my adolescence having this revelatory experience - I can have any music I want, and I can get it immediately. For me and for a lot of people I know, there's this musical eclecticism that happened.","I don't want to have to compromise my morals in order to make a living.","My image seems to be so infantilized, and I don't really know why. It belittles the music.","I can't censor myself; it's really important for me to say how I feel.","I'm a super-introverted person.","I don't even wear shoes with heels because I hate making a noise when I walk and people looking at me.","It's kind of like I'm Phil Spector, and I'm forcing a young girl to make pop music and perform exhaustively. Except, instead of it being someone else, that girl is also me.","I always wanted to be really experimental.","As a producer, I'm trying to challenge myself to just make something that is of a professional quality - not necessarily pop music, but maybe in the sense that Nine Inch Nails is professional quality.","When I'm making a song that's very Grimes, it just feels very insular and it feels weird to have someone else do something on it.","The thing about music is it's not an obscure pursuit, it's a very natural thing for human beings to do. Once you put in the effort, the learning curve is very fast.","I'm against spending money to record.","I'm tired of being considered vapid for liking pop music or caring about fashion as if these things inherently lack substance or as if the things I enjoy somehow make me a lesser person.","I'm tired of being congratulated for being thin because I can more easily fit into sample sizes from the runway.","I'm sad that it's uncool or offensive to talk about environmental or human rights issues.","I'm just very obsessed with Japanese stuff in general.","I have a lot of Japanese friends: I grew up in Vancouver, and there's this huge Japanese population over there.","It's really hard to be on stage and packing your gear when people who just saw you play are in the room, because they all just want to talk to you.","Usually I perform with dancers.","I like going crazy. And not just for art - I like extremes in general.","I've always been very intense about everything I do.","I was incredibly unpopular in high school but also extremely notorious.","I have an intense desire to constantly make music, and I don't feel that way about anything else.","My favorite music is never the music that anyone else likes, and other people's favorite songs are always my least favorite.","My dream job would be sitting in a room, cranking out hits for Rihanna.","It's interesting to be a front person who is controlling the majority of the sound.","If I went on 'American Idol,' I would definitely be kicked out immediately.","My set can get really screamo and aggressive, or it can be ambient and Enya-esque.","I want to make Grimes a high-fashion sci-fi act.","I don't own anything designer.","I've always been such a nerd.","I listen to a lot of medieval music.","I like creating beauty out of scary things.","I think my sound is post-Internet.","My manager lives on my block; four of the apartments in my apartment complex of seven are people I know. It's a really close-knit community, and almost everyone on these few blocks are artists or graphic designers, because we live right on the cusp of a warehouse district.","There's definitely a solitary aspect to not having a band, and there are times when I wish that I did.","From an early age, I knew I would be unhappy if I wasn't doing something creative.","I'm not trained in music.","I'm not, like, a natural performer. It's sort of a thing that I've had to learn to do.","I need to be able to work for 20 or 30 hours in one go in complete darkness, alone with just the computer glow.","Music is a religion to me and my friends.","If you look at the way people behave at shows, icons are now musicians; they are the people that we worship.","There are a lot of musicians I've met on Twitter where it was like, 'Hey, I like your music' - and then I ended up meeting them and it turned into a friendship.","I like to aestheticize every possible thing that can be aestheticized.","If you tell someone you're doing something innovative, they'll think you're doing something innovative.","I want to make an a cappella record to release for free.","Fashion can be a really powerful tool, but it's also a place where you can be totally humiliated and have your power taken from you.","I think if you're good at art, you'll be good at most types of art.","I can tell really early on in a painting if I'm going to toss it or not.","I start a lot of songs and throw them out because the energy is not right. It's almost like the file becomes cursed. I have to delete it.","I'm actually not a particularly negative person, but I feel like most things are better when they're not actualized. The motivation that comes from wanting something is so much more driving of people than actually getting it.","Especially with music, people want confidence.","I love a lot of very sentimental music, but I shouldn't necessarily be the person who makes it.","Success, for me, is a song that can deliver shivers.","The thing is, I really like working. If I sit around too much, I get really bad anxiety.","There used to be a lot of industry in Montreal, and now there's not, so it's really easy to get huge, empty spaces where you can practice and make music or make art for very, very cheap.","I just can't perform well unless I'm wearing jeans.","I'm a very unhealthy person, and Montreal is very cold, and I'm usually sick when I'm there.","I'm a very nervous, shy person.","Removing all stimulation around you is a really positive thing in terms of stimulating your creativity.","I think I have serious latent Catholic guilt issues.","I'm not good at being, like, a sexy girl.","Basically, I'm really impressionable and have no sense of consistency in anything I do.","You rarely find someone who sings really well and who produces really well; it's a problem, and I just think it's a missing link in the music scene.","I like performing, but I usually get really sick when I'm on tour, and it's just hard.","You want people to hate you. If you're just making people happy, you're like Mumford & Sons.","I've seen Animal Collective live, and I suffered permanent hearing loss from that show!","I get offers to do huge-budget music videos with big production companies all the time, but I have no interest.","Most of my music videos were made for under $200.","I'm not interested in making art unless I'm totally freaked out and worried people are going to hate it."],"Grizz Chapman":["When you go through something, like, you learn to appreciate little things - the birds, trees, flowers.","Hit the gym... Working out is the key to your life.

When I was his age, I wasn't thinking about giving someone a kidney. How do you ever repay someone for something like that? You can't. It's not like borrowing $20 from someone and telling them you're going to give it back. It's something that you can never repay someone for.","I pay attention to everything now - the taste of bread, the taste of water.","You can put a kidney in your body - and somewhere down the line, your body might reject it.","I was a celebrity bodyguard. I didn't keep the best hours or choose the best food when I was on the road.","I'm on a never-ending quest to get back on a TV series, and I want to get on 'The Walking Dead.'","Why can't a seven-foot guy play a doctor? Why can't I be a teacher? Why can't I be a football coach? Why can't I be a cab driver? Anything. Anything else than that. I can cry. I can do those things that they think the big guys can't do. So just give us a chance.","Whatever I can do for the longevity of my life, I'm going to do.","Even though you don't feel anything, you need to get an annual check-up.","I didn't want to die. I wanted to live. I wanted to be with my family and wanted to see my 11-year-old son grow up.","I get a lot of the time, 'We don't know how to market you,' or, 'You're too big.' Or, 'We have one of you already,'. But you don't have one of me already; you don't have a seven-foot, lovable guy. You don't have that.","My agent knows what I'm looking for. And I'm also looking for a new agent, too, so I'm putting it out there. Again, I'm not going to turn down every role, because there is no bad role, really. It's all what you bring to the role, but that traditional, 'Stand here and open a rope,' I'm not doing it.","Opening up is something I have to learn how to do if I'm going to be in this business.","I want to show there's an edgier side of people who love comic books. And there are people who don't look like you and me who do read comic books and who love artists.","Being a nerd is not always a bad thing. It's actually cool to be a nerd.","I'm the biggest nerd you know. I'm a nerd, I'm a techie, and I don't have a problem with saying it.","Keep your blood pressure under control and pay attention to your urine. If it's foamy, that's not a good sign, and you need to check out your kidneys.","I was diagnosed with hypertension when I was 24, and I battled hypertension for about 10 to 12 years, and then I went to the doctor for something else, and he found that I had high levels of protein in my urine, and that's how I found out I had kidney disease.","I was on dialysis three times a week for four and a half hours each time.","I was in the hospital for about two weeks because I had some complications due to the transition to kidney from dialysis and getting off of that.","Tracy and I were pretty good friends before '30 Rock.' The chemistry you see on camera - that's what it is. What you see on camera - that's just friends, so that's why it comes across so well on TV.","You can't take away that Liz Lemon is my boo; you can't take that away.","I'm on a never-ending quest to get back on a TV series, and I want to get on 'The Walking Dead'.

I think it is a real and achievable goal.","Osteoporosis, as the third threat, is particularly attributable to women's physiology.","Since the reduction of risk factors is the scientific basis for primary prevention, the World Health Organization promotes the development of an integrated strategy for prevention of several diseases, rather than focusing on individual ones.","That the AIDS pandemic is threatening sustainable development in Africa only reinforces the reality that health is at the center of sustainable development.","This double burden of disease is rapidly putting a serious brake on the development efforts of many countries.","We are also in the process of defining how best to work together with food and other companies to address diet and physical activity factors in order to prevent chronic diseases.","When public and private sectors combine intellectual and other resources, more can be achieved.","With an annual investment of $66 billion by 2007, we can save 8 million lives each year.","Women's health is one of WHO's highest priorities.","The burden of disease falls on the poor.","This syndrome, SARS, is now a worldwide health threat...

A farmer on subsidies is part welfare bum, whereas a free-market farmer is a small businessman with a gun.","Spending is not caring. Spending is what politicians do instead of caring. Spending more does not guarantee success. Politicians like to measure spending because it is easier than measuring actual metrics of accomplishment.","Our goal is to shrink government to the size where we can drown it in a bathtub.","Less government, less regulation, lower taxes.","The job of the government isn't to go around and try and make people sacrifice, it's to try and make people free. The reason why we have a national defense is to protect our freedoms.","Compromise is moving in the right directlon more slowly than one might like.","My goal is to cut government in half in twenty-five years, to get it down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub.","Hypocrisy is the tribute that vice pays to virtue.","Every time we've cut the capital gains tax, the economy has grown. Whenever we raise the capital gains tax, it's been damaged. It's one of those taxes that most clearly damages economic growth and jobs.","The important thing about tax reform is you make the tax code less complicated, easier for people to understand.","Government should enforce rule of law. It should enforce contracts, it should protect people bodily from being attacked by criminals. And when the government does those things, it is facilitating liberty. When it goes beyond those things, it becomes destructive to both human happiness and human liberty.","A lot of young people just starting out unskilled, as all Americans do when they're born here, come to this country, and so the business community is for immigration.

So raising taxes is what politicians do, instead of reducing spending.","Everyone would have bigger and safer cars if they didn't have those CAFE standards: corporate average fuel economy.","There are several reasons to oppose tax increases.

People who came to this country are more freedom-loving and more American than people who just happened to be born here.","We cannot allow anything that's called 'national defense' to justify any and all spending. We need to be very, very careful that we don't overspend and say, 'Oh, that's defense,' when perhaps it isn't.","I'm for tax reform, not tax increases.","The welfare state creates its own victim/client constituency. By making individuals free and independent, we reduce the need for 'charity' to those truly needy citizens what we can certainly afford to help through real charity.","The Democratic Party is made up of trial lawyers, labor unions, government employees, big city political machines, the coercive utopians, the radical environmentalists, feminists, and others who want to restructure society with tax dollars and government fiat.","We plan to pick up another five seats in the Senate and hold the House through redistricting through 2012. And rather than negotiate with the teachers' unions and the trial lawyers and the various leftist interest groups, we intend to break them.","There's no reason to raise taxes. Taxes should be lower... The problem we have is that government spends too much, not that taxes are too low.","We want to reduce the size of government in half as a percentage of GNP over the next 25 years.

No. Grover Norquist and Americans for Tax Reform focus on the tax issue. The tax issue is a powerful issue.","If the parties would brand themselves the way Coke and Pepsi and other products do so that you knew what you were buying, it had quality control. I vote for the Republican. He or she will not raise my taxes. I'll buy one. I'll take that one home.","We should reduce total government spending as a percentage of the economy. The left wants to focus on the deficit so they can take us away from the focus on spending as a percentage of the economy.","As long as we're focused on spending, there are only two ways to do that: One is spend less, and Democrats have no solutions for that. Or we have pro-growth policies that make the economy grow so the dead-weight cost of government becomes a smaller percentage of the economy and therefore less expensive.","Twenty-five years ago, I created the Taxpayer Protection Pledge at the federal level. Then I brought it to the state and local level. About 97 percent of the Republicans in the House and 85 percent in the Senate have signed on, and the number of candidates who have taken the pledge is even higher. It's become a party position.","The American taxpayers are a powerful force. They don't want their taxes raised. Obama and the Democrats have a fight with the American people, not with me.","Well, certainly the Democrats have been arguing to raise the capital gains tax on all Americans. Obama says he wants to do that. That would slow down economic growth. It's not necessarily helpful to the economy. Every time we've cut the capital gains tax, the economy has grown. Whenever we raise the capital gains tax, it's been damaged.","I run a taxpayer group - the most powerful guy in D.C., nonsense. OK? There are buildings with thousands of people in them, all lobbying for more spending and higher levels of spending and more government commitments. And there are a handful - a handful of groups that fight for less spending.","Obama wants to take the individual small business tax to 44 percent, and the corporate rate - he says - down to 28 percent or whatever. But that really damages the small businesses. And it doesn't make us competitive. You got to take them both down to 20, because state and local corporate taxes are 5 percent.","I think it's very important to always make sure that you're talking to the entire coalition and to as many Americans as possible; not to go chasing after one little group or another. The Democrats would bring new groups into their party and not notice that larger groups are going out the back door.","Look, the center right coalition in American politics today is best understood as a coalition of groups and individuals that on the issue that brings them to politics what they want from the government is to be left alone.","I know the activists I deal with, we sort of try and check each other to make sure that we haven't gone native, that you come to Washington thinking it's a cesspool, you don't want to end up thinking it's really a hot tub and getting used to it. So that's something one has to keep an eye on all the time.","When I was younger, I thought of myself as a Nixon Republican because he was the anti-Communist.","This always confuses liberals, that conservatives like the military and don't like the bureaucracy. That's because the military has their guns pointed out and the bureaucracy has them pointed in.","Democrats are people who raise your taxes and spend your money on weird stuff. They steal your guns, and they spit on your faith.","The question is: How do we reduce spending from 25% of GDP, which is where Obama put us? The focus is on total government spending. Can we bring it down, in a reasonable and politically acceptable way? That's what the Paul Ryan plan does. It puts us on a gradual reform path to reducing the size of government.","Obama has been perhaps the most partisan President since Truman. He hasn't learned to be civil - note his insulting speech to Paul Ryan, who did us the courtesy of scoring a budget. The president has to talk to Republicans when it comes to the debt ceiling. He has reached the debt ceiling before anyone expected.","Obama is a guy who claims to be unaware that there was a Tea Party, a guy that's detached from the country.","We should reduce total government spending as a percentage of the economy.","A 20-pound weight on the back of a small horse is more damaging than a 20-pound weight on a very big horse.","The goal is to reduce the size and scope of government spending, not to focus on the deficit. The deficit is the symptom of the disease.","The tax issue is the most powerful issue in American politics going back to the Tea Party.","We need a Federal government that does what the government needs to do and stops doing what the government ought not to be doing.","Immigration is America's No. 1 economic asset. The rest of the world can't do that. We can have every smart person we want, every high-skilled person we want.","The future of the Republican Party, all the different folks looking to lead the Republican Party at the national level in the future, recognize we should do immigration reform.","People who say that there's a vote within the Republican Party that moves against immigrants is just factually not accurate.","If you feel the government should leave you alone, you're a Republican. If you think the job of the government is to go push people around and take things for you, then you're a Democrat.","If you're so committed to liberty that you see the Soviet Union as a threat, you're a Republican. If you're kind of indifferent to freedom and the level of the lack of freedom in the Soviet Union is just a question of extent and not really threatening to anybody, then you're a Democrat.","Democrats are people who raise your taxes and spend your money on weird stuff. They steal your guns, and they spit on your faith. And because the Democratic Party was taken over by the aggressive secular guys, they became hostile not just to conservative Catholics and evangelical Christians, but Orthodox Jews and Muslims and Mormons.","Reforming Social Security to make it fully funded and independently held, that's compassionate because it allows people to control their own lives; cutting taxes on families and all Americans to let people have more control over their lives.","Conservatives should insist that defense spending be examined with the same seriousness that we demand in examining the books of those government agencies that spend taxpayer money in the name of welfare, the environment, or education.","We laugh at liberals who declare that their favorite spending programs should be exempt because the spending is for a noble cause.","Spending should be transparent. All spending by the Pentagon should be online. Every check. Exceptions should be made for legitimate national security issues. But military and civilian pay and retirement benefits are not state secrets. This has already been done in many state governments.","Not continuing a tax cut is not technically a tax increase.","It is wrong to divide the nation white against black, native born against immigrant or one religion against another. It is also wrong to divide people by income. East Germany was not an improvement over South Africa. Obama divides Americans against each other. This is wrong.","Income should be taxed one time at one rate, not again and again.","Someday I hope Americans will not believe that anyone had to spend his or her days fighting for limited government because everyone they know wants maximum freedom and minimum statism.","People learn their politics at a young age and tend to stick with it.","Smaller government, more individual responsibility, more individual control creates more Republicans. More state power and ownership and control and top-down decision-making creates more Democrats.","As more and more Americans own shares of stock, more and more Americans understand that taxing businesses is taxing them. Regulating businesses is taxing them. They ought to be thinking long-term about their ownership, not just their income, and that they should pay taxes on capital, as well as taxes on labor.","Most Republicans have made it very clear they're not interested in raising taxes. They want to reform government.","If you have to change the law to get more money, that's a tax increase, and Americans for Tax Reform supports all efforts of tax reform, getting rid of deductions or credits, or something that's misclassified, as long as you at the same time reduce rates so that it's not a hidden tax.","The American taxpayers are a powerful force. They don't want their taxes raised.","I was an anti-communist before I was political in other ways.","What's hurting the U.S. economy is total government spending. The deficit is an indicator that the government is spending so much money that it can't even get around to stealing all of the money that it wants to spend. But the tip of the iceberg is not what hit the Titanic - it was the 90 percent of the iceberg under water.","The Republican Party and the conservative free market movement have been presidentially focused for too long.","The taxpayer group in every state is always - always referred to as nuts.","People who are willing to stick to a strong pro-life position aren't going to be pushed off a strong anti-tax position. For people who like to think in ideologically cohesive ways, it makes no sense, but that's the way it is.","I was a math guy as a kid. I was really good at math. I wasn't particularly interested in it.","Our job is to make people free.","Stupider than France is not where we want to be on tax policy.","If you raise taxes, it won't reduce the deficit. The other team will simply spend the resources.","I'm not for no taxes. That would be an anarchist. I am for lower taxes.","If you let people own their land, they take care of it. That's why privately owned land is always taken care of, and the parks look like cesspools. Nobody takes care of what everybody owns.","It would be unwise for the modern Republican Party to come across as hostile to immigration. That has been the losing position in American history for 200 years.","Historically, opposition to immigration in the United States has been racially and religiously motivated in the ugliest, nastiest way possible.","My goal in life is to get the federal government down to half its present size and under control, and then I can write murder mysteries.","Tax increases slow economic growth. Why would you raise taxes? We need to reform spending, the tens of trillions of unfunded liabilities can never be funded by tax increases, that can only be fixed by reducing spending.","Americans for Tax Reform is a national taxpayer organization dedicated to opposing any and all tax increases. We work at the national, state and local level for lower taxes, less government spending and limited government.","The central issue of our time - of all times - is the size, power and scope of government.","Taxation is not charity. It is not voluntary. As we shrink the state and make government smaller, we will find that more and more people are able to take care of themselves.","We have to have a conversation about whether Obama's plan to increase spending to occupy Afghanistan helps make America a safer country, or not. I think at some point, we may decide that we don't have to have that size military and cost footprint in the country. You look at what you want to accomplish, how many soldiers you need.","Spending an extra dollar on the D.C. public school system isn't spending an extra dollar on education. Spending an extra dollar with the Pentagon doesn't buy you an extra dollar on defense. Republicans need to look skeptically at military spending.","Tax reductions are usually simpler and less distortive. I'm certainly willing to look at getting rid of tax deductions/credits, and go to dramatically reduced rates.","My wife and I have what's known as mixed marriage. I am a Methodist, she is a Muslim. So we're keeping it in the M's.","There are 100 different doors to come into the conservative movement. You can disagree with 99 of them, as long as you agree on one: more-limited government."],"Grégory Baugé":["I'm certain I can be the fastest in the world.","My dad was very into cycling and had lots of magazines around the house. So I knew about the best cyclists of that era: Arnaud Tournant, Laurent Gane. I watched a lot of the Tour de France and the Tour of Spain with him.","I started as a road cyclist and did all types apart from BMX. I started doing a lot of competitions, and then my dad suggested I tried the track. At first the thought of falling is scary, but you realise soon that if you go fast enough, you'll be fine. I realised it was more than a hobby when I was 16.","It is still difficult being a black cyclist. There are people who say bad things to you that they won't to a white person. It is stupid that that is the case, but your skin colour is there, and some people judge you on that."],"Guan Tianlang":["The AAC is the best amateur event in the region and the most important tournament to me every year.","I like playing many other sports, such as basketball.","My biggest dream is to win four Majors in a year.","On a school day, I practice for two hours and more than half a day on weekends.","I started playing golf at about four years old.","The experience at the Masters was two years ago, and I am eager to win again this year so I can return to Augusta National in 2016.","It is a lot of work when you have to go to school and then try to improve your game at the same time.","The AAC at Royal Melbourne was a wonderful memory for me. I had a slightly disappointing finish, but I gained a lot of experience by playing in the last group.","I want to win a major, and hopefully I can win the four majors in one year.","I hope I can make more miracles, more dreams come true."],"Gucci Mane":["Sometimes you almost have to laugh to keep from crying to deal with the pain associated with the 'hood.","I had given thought to acting, but I never really had a good enough opportunity or a character who made sense and paralleled my life a little bit. I feel like I'm one of the poster boys for a bad guy in a movie. I feel like I'm a good person to play a bad guy in a movie. I can say that.","I would collaborate with James Franco as a rapper any day.","I'm satisfied and proud of the things I did - even the bumps and the bruises that I've had on the way. You fall down, you get up, you brush yourself off and you keep going. And that's what we're doing.","A lot of times when you keep it real with somebody, you can't expect them to keep it real with you.","I'm not a fan of anybody music who I feel like a sucka. I don't listen to you. They play you in the club, you can have the #1 jam, but if I know your character, how can I listen to your music?","That fame monster's a fool, man. It really is.","My goal is to drop 10 projects in 2013. All albums. I gotta do it. I know the 10 projects I want to drop.","A lot that was happening in 2005, 2006, good and bad, the beats reflected it. It was a lot of money around. People was making music to throw money to."],"Guglielmo Marconi":["I am glad to have this opportunity of expressing my high appreciation of the honour extended to me many years ago by the Royal Swedish Academy of Science by enrolling me amongst its members.","Every day sees humanity more victorious in the struggle with space and time.","Thanks to the high standing which science has for so long attain and to the impartiality of the Nobel Prize Committee, the Nobel Prize for Physics is rightly considered everywhere as the highest reward within the reach of workers in Natural Philosophy.","You will also allow me to thank the Academy for inviting me to lecture in Stockholm, for its hospitality, and for the opportunity afforded me for admiring the charm of your people and the beauty of your country."],"Gugu Mbatha-Raw":["When you become a slave to a public persona and don't feel comfortable without it, it becomes a shield, and it shouldn't come at the expense of your self-worth.","My personal style is somewhat androgynous and simple. With my lifestyle, I've become more of a minimalist.","For me, I try and be authentic in my choices and follow my instincts, and I think it's a valuable message for women in today's society to learn to love yourself.","I enjoy classics, but classics are classics for a reason. I prefer to focus on the future. There are a lot of new stories to be heard.","Speaking as a mixed-race woman, there aren't many historical stories about people like me.","If you're an artist, it's great to have a knowledge of the business and be educated about that, but you've got to keep the balance right between business and artistry; otherwise, you get cynical.","Different fragrances promote different emotions, and I find that fragrance gets me in the frame of mind for that person.","I just love performing so much, and I threw myself into every musical theater production that was going in my home town and at school. And then, I went to the National Youth Music Theatre, which was really a galvanizing experience for me when I was 17.","I was born in the '80s, so I don't really remember it very strongly, but the music is so iconic. And so those artists - Madonna, Prince, Janet Jackson, Whitney Houston - you still hear those songs all the time. And there's such a distinctive style - the clothes, the shoulder pads, the big hair, the perm.","Everyone says to you, 'if you play Ophelia, you'll end up crazy,' but we're all somewhere on the spectrum of mental health, and I think that if you approach it that way it's not such an intimidating issue.","I don't really want to just play the girlfriend or the love interest. I get so many scripts like that, and - not to moan, because I'm really fortunate - but I just look at those scripts, and my heart sinks a little bit because I think there's so much more to us than that.","The 'Pride and Prejudice' with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle was something I watched on a weekly basis with my mum at home in Oxfordshire.","I didn't really grow up on hip-hop. Ella Fitzgerald and the old school jazz divas are more my comfort zone.","When I was nine, 'The Borrowers' was such a big series for me!","This is going to sound really sad, but I didn't really have any heartthrobs when I was growing up. I was a bit of a geek.","Corsets were a challenge in 'Belle;' fake nails tripped me up in 'Blackbird.' Guess I'm not a mani type of girl!","I like to choose things that fit my body for sure; you learn to find the things that complement your shape.","I like the collarbone, a very clean collarbone. I think there's something also very delicate and balletic about that part of a woman's body, and I'm not really a cleavage person, but I do like a back or a shoulder; I think there's something very alluring about backless dresses.","In my own life, when I'm not working, I do wear a lot of black. I think I do feel very comfortable in black.","I'm interested in playing lots of different complex women.","I was always the one leading the way in terms of wanting to do acting, singing and dancing. I was lucky that my mother had a very well-adjusted perspective of the world and never pressured me to do anything I didn't want to do.","I think there are parts of myself in every character I play.","At home I wear my own clothes, no makeup and don't do anything exciting with my hair. I get to borrow pretty dresses for the red carpet and have experts do my hair and makeup.","I've always sung. I was really into musical theater when I was growing up. As a kid, I listened to Ella Fitzgerald and Nina Simone, actually, on cassette tapes.","Because of my job, my hair gets played with a lot on set, so I try to give it little bit of breathing space when I'm not working.","I do a lot of yoga, and when I'm in L.A., I have an outdoorsy sort of lifestyle. It's sort of comfortable, West Coast, yoga chic.","When I'm not working, I'm really, really low key. I don't wear makeup unless I have to; I don't get my hair done unless I really need to.","The actors that inspire me are the comedians and the people able to shape-shift into different roles and into different media.","I try not to define myself. Other people are going to do that for you anyway.","I like being free to take on any project that inspires me and to trust that the work will speak for itself.","I played Dorothy in 'The Wizard of Oz.' That was my first role on stage.","I was so thrilled to be in 'Doctor Who.' It's such a wonderful experience, and the fan base that that show has never fails to surprise me.","In 2009, I was living in London and getting work I enjoyed.","I see L.A. as a workplace rather than somewhere to live. If I don't get out, I go crazy. If you have a little success, people treat you differently, so it's good to keep a healthy perspective. It's acting, not rocket science.","From the age of four, I loved ballet and tap. I was in the school band, the choir, and all my school plays.","I feel like I learn in every project.","You have to be able to appreciate who you are.","In terms of 'Beyond the Lights' and 'Belle,' they're definitely stories about identity. They're female empowerment stories. So I'm exploring that through my work.","This is what I've always wanted to do ever since I was a little girl. Coming from dance and theater and what was accessible to me in my hometown, it was all I did after school and on the weekends. The idea of making my hobby into my job was the ultimate quest.","I never wanted to be like anyone growing up. It's always been about the enjoyment, and I've just never wanted to imitate anyone.","Watching and learning from the great Josette Bushell-Mingo, who was playing Cleopatra in Antony and Cleopatra at the time, and then to return to the same stage six months later playing a lead role, was incredible - I fell in love with the poetry and the breadth of the language so much that I didn't want it to end.","You've got to find a way to relate to people. I just did an improvised episode for Joe Swanberg's new Netflix show, 'Easy,' and it was a huge learning curve for me and taught me so much about fear and courage. But when you're present in the moment, the audience, it's incomparable.","I definitely grew up to Nina Simone and a lot of Ella Fitzgerald. And I loved Amy Winehouse. I loved that sort of soulful singer.","That's the wonderful thing about acting - you play a role. It's about humanity, rather than labeling.","It's odd doing a movie, and then a year and half later having to go to a premiere and talk about what you did, and get dressed up and have your picture taken.","I am an only child, so I relate to the intensity of that single-parent, mother-daughter relationship.","I love to go hiking. There's a lot of concrete in L.A., and I come from the Shires, so it's important for me to get back in touch with nature.","One of my favourite places is Hampstead Heath. When I first moved to London, I lived in Highgate, and I would walk on the Heath at the weekends and go to the Kenwood House coffee shop.","For film, I think because it's more detailed, and especially with historical material, you really have to find the right projects. Speaking as a mixed-race woman, there aren't many historical stories about people like me. When people think of 'dual heritage,' they think it's a modern concept, but really it's not.","Sometimes you can't fight change, because you're a part of it, and I feel that in the context of these films that are happening now, there is a kind of change coming in terms of how history is represented on film, and the African, and the African-American and British African experience.","I'm a very improvisational cook. I sort of like to make things up as I go along. I'm quite creative in the kitchen.","I spent a chunk of time in New Orleans doing the movie 'Free State Of Jones,' getting to work with Matthew McConaughey, and also did 'Concussion,' where I got to work with Will Smith.","I think being biracial is a different experience. I think that, and coming from the U.K., I feel as much white as I do black. And so it's really important for me to address these issues of identity in my work. But also, you know, we're always stronger when we work on, you know, what we have in common. And I love exploring that in my work.","I feel like my work has been incredibly diverse."],"Guido van Rossum":["I have this hope that there is a better way. Higher-level tools that actually let you see the structure of the software more clearly will be of tremendous value.","If you decide to design your own language, there are thousands of sort of amateur language designer pitfalls.","Now, it's my belief that Python is a lot easier than to teach to students programming and teach them C or C++ or Java at the same time because all the details of the languages are so much harder. Other scripting languages really don't work very well there either.","Yes, I definitely believe that it has some good cross-platform properties. Object orientation was one of the techniques I used to make Python platform independent.","The second stream of material that is going to come out of this project is a programming environment and a set of programming tools where we really want to focus again on the needs of the newbie. This environment is going to have to be extremely user-friendly.","If you're talking about Java in particular, Python is about the best fit you can get amongst all the other languages. Yet the funny thing is, from a language point of view, JavaScript has a lot in common with Python, but it is sort of a restricted subset.","There was a project at Lawrence Livermore National Labs where many years ago they went down this path for scripting and controlling very large numerical calculations.","I would guess that the decision to create a small special purpose language or use an existing general purpose language is one of the toughest decisions that anyone facing the need for a new language must make.","In my daily work, I work on very large, complex, distributed systems built out of many Python modules and packages. The focus is very similar to what you find, for example, in Java and, in general, in systems programming languages.","Mark Hammond is working in this area, with Windows Scripting Host. It is definitely an area where Python fits almost perfectly. That's quite independent from Java, actually.","My own perception of that is somewhat colored by where people ask my advice, which is still, of course, about changes to Python internals or at least standard libraries."],"Guilherme Leal":["If we want to increase our own happiness, we need to invest in growing the community happiness and also take care of the whole, of Mother Earth.","Brazil has one of the greatest natural patrimonies in terms of biodiversity.","I believe that companies are, above all, agents of transformation.","Creating mechanisms for ending deforestation and promoting regeneration of the environment is one of the most effective ways of achieving net-zero emissions.","We have serious challenges regarding climate change, unsustainable use of natural resources, water scarcity, loss of biodiversity, forests and farmland. Not to mention the huge inequality still prevailing in several parts of the planet.","I pretty much believe, as everyone in the B Team does, that business must succeed beyond the bottom line. More important than profits is how you get to them. Measuring financial earnings and losses only is definitely not enough and has led us astray from creating a better world for all.","Make no mistake: business forces, if used long-sightedly, are the tools for leveraging new consumer behaviors, new and smarter ways of production, and for accelerating the transition to a sustainable world.","We need to be both conscious and competent to design products that emulate nature's life cycles, making sure that they endure and are either recycled or absorbed.","At Natura, we have long been committed to measure and improve the impacts of our activities.","We need a mobilized and active civil society using its purchasing power to demand sustainable products and practices. It is also essential that governments commit to the future, creating fiscal and regulatory conditions for sustainable policies to thrive.","We are working with the communities in building institutional relationships with local governments and businesses to create ways to get value from the Amazonian area in order to keep the forest as the forest. This makes sense for us from the perspective of climate change and of poverty.","At the end of the 1990s, we decided we should invest our best efforts to work in a sustainable way with the ingredients that the Amazon produces."],"Guillaume Apollinaire":["Now and then it's good to pause in our pursuit of happiness and just be happy.","It's raining my soul, it's raining, but it's raining dead eyes.","A structure becomes architectural, and not sculptural, when its elements no longer have their justification in nature.","Artists are, above all, men who want to become inhuman.","I love men, not for what unites them, but for what divides them, and I want to know most of all what gnaws at their hearts.","The plastic virtues: purity, unity, and truth, keep nature in subjection.","I hate artists who are not of their time.","Joy always came after pain.","Without poets, without artists, men would soon weary of nature's monotony.","When man wanted to make a machine that would walk he created the wheel, which does not resemble a leg.","One can't carry one's father's corpse about everywhere."],"Guillaume Canet":["Everything goes by so fast that if you want to be a part of it, you need to go that fast. But because you go that fast, you don't lead the life you should lead.","Directing remains very psychological, and it takes a lot of time and reflection. When you're an actor, it takes less time, and you can express yourself physically.","You have to draw on your unconscious when you make a film - you can't worry about whether it's costing a lot of money.","You need to feed yourself with emotions and life or you'll become empty.","It was really hard to find another project after my first film.","I would rather do really good French films than 'American Pie.'","I spent all my youth with horses.","I've had gay friends who grew up in small towns in France who had to lie for most of their lives, even to themselves. But eventually such lies become stronger than the people, and they have to face them.","It's physically and psychologically exhausting to make a film.","In any group there is more or less tension between people, and there are complicities and affinities.","I'm an absolute fan of 1970s New York in films like 'Mean Streets' and 'Dog Day Afternoon.'","I think it's very boring for a director to always do the same kind of movies.","I know that one day I would love to do a musical.","Music is one of the important things for me in cinema."],"Guillermo Cabrera Infante":["I believe that writers, unless they consider themselves terribly exquisite, are at heart people who live by night, a little bit outside society, moving between delinquency and conformity.","I think that I've tried many times to get Cuba in my writings, especially Havana, which was once a great and fascinating city.","But I do not have the reader in mind when I write. No true writer does that.","I have one main reader, Miriam Gomez, my wife. She reads everything I write - I have not finished writing something and she is already reading it.","For me, literature is a complex game, both mental and concrete, which is acted out in a physical manner on the page.","I am the only British writer who writes in Spanish.","I do not consider myself a Hispanic writer.","I live in London and I am a British subject, although I do write in Spanish, of course.","American literature had always considered writing a very serious matter.","A very wise author once said that a writer writes for himself, and then publishes for money. I write for myself and publish just for the reader.","You are just in the middle of a struggle with words which are really very stubborn things, with a blank page, with the damn thing that you use to write with, a pen or a typewriter, and you forget all about the reader when you are doing that.","The relationship between reader and characters is very difficult. It is even more peculiar than the relationship between the writer and his characters.","Puns are a form of humor with words.","I think writers rush in where everybody is very frightened to tread.","Writers rush in where publishers fear to tread and where translators fear to tread.","I was never a true journalist, I was a movie critic.","I wrote for a weekly magazine and then edited a literary magazine, but I did not really feel comfortable with the profession of journalism itself.","I was able to read a movie before I was able to read a book.","Watching a movie from beginning to end is like reading, because even though what you see are images, they are telling you a story.","There were influences in my life that were more important than journalism, such as comic strips and radio.","I was an avid radio fan when I was a boy, as well as a great lover of comic strips.","I read the Odyssey because it was the story of a man who returned home after being absent for more than twenty years and was recognized only by his dog.","I don't have any style.","I am against the notion of style in itself.","I am a writer of fragments.","I describe my works as books, but my publishers in Spain, in the United States, and elsewhere insist on calling them novels.","That is what I define as a novel: something that has a beginning, a middle and an end, with characters and a plot that sustain interest from the first sentence to the last. But that is not what I do at all.","I left my country because I was forced to, and I do not think that I am going to lose my language because I live in England.","I know that many writers have had to write under censorship and yet produced good novels; for instance, Cervantes wrote Don Quixote under Catholic censorship.","I think all writing is done through memory.","I do not believe in inspiration, but I must have a title in order to work, otherwise I am lost.","No, absolutely not, writing doesn't have to be like a jigsaw puzzle, it can be a very linear undertaking.","What I do believe is that there is always a relationship between writing and reading, a constant interplay between the writer on the one hand and the reader on the other.","When I write, the first blank page, or any blank page, means nothing to me. What means something is a page that has been filled with words.","If you look closely, there is no book more visual than Three Trapped Tigers, in that it is filled with blank pages, dark pages, it has stars made of words, the famous magical cube made of numbers, and there is even a page which is a mirror.","It means that no matter what you write, be it a biography, an autobiography, a detective novel, or a conversation on the street, it all becomes fiction as soon as you write it down.","Well, I write in exile because I cannot return to my country, so I have no choice but to see myself as an exiled writer.","I think that like all writers - and if any writer disagrees with this, then he is not a writer - I write primarily for myself.","When I write, I enjoy myself so much that what is being written really needs no reader.","I don't much believe in the idea of characters. I write with words, that is all. Whether those words are put in the mouth of this or that character does not matter to me.","I have assiduously avoided calling my books novels.","For me, words are just words, nothing else.","So I do not consider myself a chronicler of my fatherland or even a chronicler of Havana.","Titles are not only important, they are essential for me. I cannot write without a title.","Many of my books have begun with the title, because naming a work already in progress makes no sense to me.","My parents were founders of the Cuban Communist Party, and I grew up extremely poor.","I first came out against Castro in June 1968, fifteen months after my book had been published, and you cannot imagine how quickly a void was created around me.","My mother had been educated at a convent, and she had been converted to communism by my father during Stalin's most rampant period, at the beginning of the 1930s. So she had two gods, God in heaven and god on earth."],"Guillermo Diaz":["I'm a loner. I like to be alone. I'm socially awkward.","It was great working with Kevin Smith - just a dream.","I had done student films for the School Of Visual Arts and for NYU and all these schools in New York, so those were my first film experiences, but they were student films, so I guess they don't really count.","When the attention is on me, off-camera, I get uncomfortable - sort of shy and at a loss for words, as you can probably tell?","When I was in high school, I wasn't really popular. I was picked on a lot. And then I did a talent show, and kids started to tell me that I did a good job. It was the first time that my peers told me that they liked what I was doing. Something clicked, and I knew that this is what I wanted to do.","I love Rob Zombie - I'd love to work with Rob Zombie or John Cameron Mitchell.","Bruce Willis is Bruce Willis in every single movie I've seen him in, except 'Death Becomes Her' and 'Mortal Thoughts,' which is another movie he was in that was very different from what he normally does.","I did a show back when I was in high school - so I was about 17 - and it was the first time I was on stage. I never even thought about being an actor before that, but after that experience, I knew it was what I wanted to do.","'Fresh' was maybe the third audition that I had after I got an agent, so I was crazy excited when I booked it.","I was named Class Clown in the high school yearbook, so I was always turning to comedy and laughter to heal and to get me through things.","I connect to humor really deeply, so I feel really comfortable just being in funny projects.","I love 'The Walking Dead.'","I'm obsessed with 'Girls.'","I remember my parents taking me to see 'The Exorcist' in theaters when I was really young. They're Cuban and didn't really speak English, so I don't think they got that it was a movie about a girl possessed by the devil.","I hit Instagram and Twitter as soon as I wake up. And then I check my texts and emails. It's funny that I check social media before I check my email.","I went to school in the Bronx. I learned to constantly try to cover up the fact that I was gay. That facade of being somebody I'm really not just to protect myself definitely helped with acting.","When I was growing up, we didn't have 'Will & Grace.' The one gay character was Monroe from 'Too Close For Comfort' - and he wasn't even gay! At least they didn't say he was. Same with Mr. Furley from 'Three's Company.' You know, these were the characters that people would always make fun of.","I'm drawn to the not-so-perfect character.","I'm a huge horror film and sci-fi fan.","Madonna's always going to be number one, but I'm definitely a Britney fan.","I would totally do a Madonna or Lady Gaga video.","I'm just a big old nerd. I'm not that cool guy at all.","I'm really into horror art, so I feel, like, a dark side in that way.","I would love to do more horror films.","I get off on pushing people's buttons sometimes.","I want to be the bad guy.","It's always nice to do the flashbacks. That's what's so great about 'Scandal' is that we get to do flashbacks and then keep figuring out and discovering more things about our characters that make them fuller.","It's important to work really hard to get what you want.","I learned to really pursue things I really wanted. If it is just for the money, that's not going to work out. You have to like it.","I got to a point where I was completely typecast, and I knew I was paying my dues, and I was happy to do so because I knew that's what had to happen, and I loved acting. But I would never go back.","I'm Cuban. My parents are immigrants.","It's TV: you just have to jump in and just do it. You don't have time to think about it. You don't have time to write a history, which makes it even better. I go with first instincts.","I have phone sessions with my therapist, who is in New York, constantly, just to talk and get it out.","It's weird: when I first got on Twitter, I had a couple hundred, then thousand, followers. Now I have over 53,000."],"Guillermo del Toro":["For me, real life is hard work. Making movies is like a vacation for my soul.","There is beauty and humility in imperfection.","If you want to know how to handle a crew, it's great to be part of a crew.","When I was a kid, monsters made me feel that I could fit somewhere, even if it was... an imaginary place where the grotesque and the abnormal were celebrated and accepted.","Monsters are the patron saints of imperfection.","More and more, as I grow older, I find myself looking for inspiration in painting, illustration, videogames, and old movies.","I feel that your ambitions should always exceed the budget.","I believe that we, every day, 24-7, all the days of our lives, we are, all of us, agents of construction and agents of destruction.","I'm not that interested in recreating reality. I'm interested in recreating an emotional truth.","Making a film is like raising a child. You cannot raise a child to be liked by everyone. You raise a child to excel, and you teach the child to be true to his own nature. There will be people who'll dislike your child because he or she is who they are, and there will be people who'll love your child immensely for the very same reason.","I loved when the superhero genre crosses with horror. Morbius. Those are the guys I gravitated towards. Blade. So for me, to be interested in doing a superhero movie, it would need to be on the dark side or a Jack Kirby property. Kamandi, Demon, Mr. Miracle - I love any Kirby.","I see horror as part of legitimate film. I don't see it as an independent genre that has nothing to do with the rest of cinema.","Insects are living metaphors for me. They are so alien and so remote and so perfect, but also they are emotionless; they don't have any human or mammalian instincts. They'll eat their young at the drop of a hat; they can eat your house! There's no empathy - none.","When I was a child, I was raised Catholic. Somewhere, I didn't fit with the saints and holy men. I discovered the monsters - in Boris Karloff, I saw a beautiful, innocent creature in a state of grace, sacrificed by sins he did not commit.","I don't think there is life beyond death. I don't. But I do believe that we get this clarity in the last minute of our life. The titles we achieved, the honors we managed, they all vanish. You are left alone with you and your deeds and the things you didn't do.","I'm a lapsed altar boy.","I saw a martyr in the Wolf Man, who is the very moving essence of outsiderness, with which I identified fully.","What is scary to me is silly to somebody else. CG isn't scary to me. It's like comedy - comedy and horror are quite similar, in that there'll always be somebody who'll say, 'I don't think that was funny.' And it's the same with things that are meant to be scary.","I think love is the greatest force in the universe. It's shapeless like water. It only takes the shape of things it becomes.","I'd love to come back as the most annoying ghost ever.","The way I love monsters is a Mexican way of loving monsters, which is that I am not judgmental. The Anglo way of seeing things is that monsters are exceptional and bad, and people are good. But in my movies, creatures are taken for granted.","I think when we wake up in the morning, we can choose between fear and love. Every morning. And every morning, if you choose one, that doesn't define you until the end... The way you end your story is important. It's important that we choose love over fear, because love is the answer.","I think that evil is a spiritual engine in our world, our lives, our universe, that functions in order to create good.","I like monsters, and when the monster is a superhero, it's a byproduct. Like Hellboy, the Hulk, Man-Thing, Swamp Thing, Sandman, Constantine, Demon, Dr. Strange, Spectre, Deadman. Those are the superheroes I followed as a kid religiously.","There is art and beauty and power in the primal images of fantasy.","To me, art and storytelling serve primal, spiritual functions in my daily life. Whether I'm telling a bedtime story to my kids or trying to mount a movie or write a short story or a novel, I take it very seriously.","'Crimson' is written in a very particular style, and it's very precise in the way it graduates into a gothic romance. The souls that will connect with it will connect deeply.","I started seeing in the monsters as a more sincere form of religion because the priests were not that great, but Frankenstein was great.","For Devil's Backbone I loved it but I felt very pressured but so I was neurotic on the shoot.","I wrote a screenplay for 'The Witches,' which Alfonso Cuaron was producing, but we couldn't get it made! The studio just wouldn't greenlight that movie. It's my favorite Roald Dahl book, 'The Witches,' because I grew up with my grandmother a lot of the time, and the relationship between the boy and the grandmother speaks volumes to me.","I love monsters the way people worship holy images. To me, they really connect in a very fundamental way to my identity.","Every movie, I complicate. I make the hard choices. I remember when I was pitching 'Pan's Labyrinth:' An anti-fascist fairy tale set in Civil War Spain, where the girl dies at the end. It's not easy.","I truly try to create beauty and reflection and all of that as conscientiously and judiciously and minutely as I can.","There is a heavy Mexican Catholic streak in my movies, and a huge Mexican sense of melodrama. Everything is overwrought, and there's a sense of acceptance of the fantastic in my films, which is innately Mexican. So when people ask, 'How can you define the Mexican-ness of your films?' I go, 'How can I not?' It's all I am.","I think there is a very quiet power in things that are not on screen.","There are two levels of vampirism: one is the regular vampire, which is just like it has always been; and then there's the super vampires, which are a new breed we've created.","I think we live in a culture that is actually hedging all of it towards comfort and immediacy, things that scare me. All the things that they sell us as a way of life scare me.","It is unnatural to deny effort, adversity, and pain.","I think that most of the monsters I dream of, I dreamt of as a child.","The problem with 'Don't Be Afraid of the Dark' was that it was designed to be a PG-13 movie. It was literally a horror movie for a younger generation. I was trying to do the film equivalent of teenage, young adult readers, and when they gave it an R rating, the movie couldn't sustain an R.","I'm fortunate enough that my personal life falls into whack with my professional life. My kids love visiting the sets; they love the monsters.","I started when I was eight, doing super 8 films.","The other thing that I started doing for myself was, I went through my diary of ideas that I keep and made sure that the translation of the comic to the movie was good.","Most of the time - in 'Pan's Labyrinth' or 'Devil's Backbone' - I'm talking about my childhood.","A lot of Mexican Catholic dogma, the way it's taught, it's about existing in a state of grace, which I found impossible to reconcile with the much darker view of the world and myself, even as a child.","I like actors that are good with pantomime and that can transmit a lot by their presence and attitude more than through their dialogue.","Hellboy is the first movie where both ends of the spectrum are combined.","But I think we are seeing a resurgence of the graphic ghost story like The Others, Devil's Backbone and The Sixth Sense. It is a return to more gothic atmospheric ghost storytelling.","Well, the first thing is that I love monsters, I identify with monsters.","I was directing before I knew it was called that.","Monsters are evangelical creatures for me.","To me, the thing love and cinema have in common is that they are about seeing. The greatest act of love you can give to anyone is to see them exactly as they are. That's the greatest act of love because you wash away imperfections.","I have a very promiscuous relationship with all my objects.","I think Roald Dahl had the rarest combination of talking to kids about complex emotions, and he was able to show you that the world of kids was sophisticated, complex, and had a lot more darkness than adults ever want to remember.","I think the greatest giant insect movie ever made is 'Them!'","If you give an actor a green screen, the shot may work, but that green screen will not inspire you on the set as a director or as an actor.","I have a lot of artifacts - books on witchcrafts and talismans. I have a big, big collection of original occult books from the 1800s and 1700s, and some of the oldest books on apparitions and vampires. All original printings. It's not that I'm a crazy believer, I just find it to be amazing research material.","I was a kid when I read Jane Eyre and fell in love with that universe. I didn't have the acumen to say the prose is old or the prose is too complex. I just fell in love with Jane's very lonely soul, much the same way I fell in love with Frankenstein's creature for the same reason. Those old souls exist in every decade in every century.","For eight years I did effects for other movies until I got my movie made.","What happens to me is that I am first and foremost a film geek.","When I was a teenager there was no video in my country. Betamax came to Mexico very slowly.","I was part of a group that had a cinema club so every week we would project two or three movies on 16 or 35mm.","I think that The Eye is a particularly Americanized take on horror.","Well I think effects are tools.","In that, Blade 2 is very much like a rock concert... if it's too loud, you're too old.","I like John Carpenter. I like some of his films more than others.","I'd grab the camera and tell people what to do, and when I was 14, someone told me that it was called directing.","It's only in modern times that we have come to glorify vampirism.","They're getting more and more experience on what to expect, and the Hellboy audience is such a faithful and fanatic audience as I am, and you have to really be very open about what you do.","I think there are movies that are so gigantic that you need a second unit.","I think Hollywood has a habit of developing 100 times more than they actually shoot.","I hope to continue doing TV, and I think that what I've learned on 'The Strain' will come in handy.","To me, movies are books. They are texts to be consulted.","Love is love. And it's much better than hatred and fear.","When you start with Super 8, you are everything. You're the DP, the sound man, the effects guy. And what I started understanding, by working for other people, is that the best type of director is someone who rose through the ranks.","Every Sunday on Channel 6 in Guadalajara, where I lived, they dedicated most every Sunday to black-and-white horror films and sci-fi. So I watched them. I watched 'Tarantula.' I watched 'The Monolith Monsters.' I watched all the Universal library.","I have 7,000 DVDs and Blu-rays. I have thousands of books - thousands - and roughly 15,000 comic books or something like that, hundreds of books about different art movements - the symbolists, the dadaists, the Pre-Raphaelites, the impressionists - you know, that I consult before I start every movie.","I want to live in a space that I designed, that is for me.","In the case of 'Shape Of Water,' I want it to feel like a song. I wanted people to come out of the movie humming the movie.","There's nothing more political than fantasy.","I'm always very, very careful when the movies happen and where they happen.","The creature from the black lagoon - I drew that creature almost every day, two, three times a day, for probably my first ten years of life, you know.","I think looking is the essential act of loving. Brothers, fathers and sons, lovers, whatever. What you do when you love someone is look at that person as that person is.","I'm a book guy first, and my education came from two encyclopedias. One was an encyclopedia of health, so I became morbidly obsessed with anatomy, and I thought I had trichinosis, an aneurism, jaundice! And then an encyclopedia of art.","I have said no to many, many Day of the Dead projects in the past, about 10 or 15, because every time I heard a take it was from someone who didn't know the celebration.","Ultimately, you walk life side-by-side with death, and the Day of the Dead, curiously enough, is about life. It's an impulse that's intrinsic to the Mexican character.","I believe that we will elevate and differentiate the discourse of cinema the more we discuss image creation in specific terms.","TV now, you have to plan it: you structure it for binge watching, meaning you structure the whole season like a three-act play. You have a first act - the first third of the season - second act is the middle third, and you structure it like that.","As a director, I design every movie to be true to itself, and damn it if they like it, and damn it if they don't.","I've been going through immigration all my life, and I've been stopped for traffic violations by cops, and they get much more curious about me than the regular guy. The moment they hear my accent, things get a little deeper.","The way they control a population is by pointing at somebody else - whether they're gay, Mexican, Jewish, black - and saying, 'They are different than you. They're the reason you're in the shape you're in. You're not responsible.' And when they exonerate you through vilifying and demonizing someone else, they control you.","You cannot dictate what people find funny, what people find attractive, or what people find scary. There is not a norm.","I don't try to sanction other people's joy in monsters. I mean, I think the fact is, humor, fantasy - you know, like fear, desire or laughter - create genres of their own: comedy, melodrama, or erotic films or horror films... The boundaries cannot be defined. It's to each his own.","I had nightmares as a kid. As an adult, I have very prosaic dreams.","Any actor I admire and enjoy working with - Sergi Lopez as the bad guy in 'Pan's Labyrinth,' or the little girl who played young Mako in 'Pacific Rim,' it makes no difference - I like actors with a very strong centre.","Every project that you write about or read about, it goes through years of hard work. We write a screenplay; we design. Then you submit those and the budget, and it's out of your hands.","I would have killed to do 'Beauty And The Beast' at Warners, which went away. I would have killed to do 'The Witches' at Warners that went away. God knows there are many, many of them. All I can do is diligently do the screenplay, diligently do the design work, deliver a budget, and then await a decision.","I'm having a lot of fun on Twitter, tweeting about books.","I was very attracted to doing 'The Wolverine' in Japan because that's my favorite chapter in the story of Wolverine. But I'm not a superhero guy.","I would like to avoid dying if possible. I do like living! The worst, I think for me, though, would be a really bedridden death.","In Mexico, you're close to death all the time.","I love to travel, anywhere in the world. Wherever it is... India... Tibet... wherever. I'll go anywhere.","Everything I do, I do it with the hope that people will watch it more than twice. Whether it's 'Pan's Labyrinth' or 'Pacific Rim' or the opening of 'The Simpsons,' I do it with that hope.","It's so much easier when you're promoting a movie that you like!"],"Guler Sabanci":["Being a good person and fair person is very important in life, I think.","I wear two hats. The one is business and increasing my shareholders' value; the other is social responsibility.","I don't have time for regrets. I go forward; I'm a doer, and I always have projects and dreams.","Sabanci has many years of experience in the tire reinforcement industry, and we are committed to the success of this business through an advanced technology relationship with KoSa and a strong commitment to our customers.","Not every woman has what I have, so if I could do something to help them, that should also be my duty.","I believe that it is girls' human rights to go to school to be educated, minimum, until they are 18.","Women leading big corporations or assuming various important social and political roles is still considered newsworthy, which clearly shows the need to further support and enhance the role of women in society.","I believe that raising the status of women in Turkey is a responsibility shared by everyone. It is not only in Turkey; we are still in need of serious support for the role of women in business and society all around the world.","I am pleased that my work has been recognized, and I hope to be a role model.","The West has the wrong perception about Turkey itself.","We're in a 21st century, transparent and connected world.","I'm very fond of classical music, especially Mozart. I find it relaxes me and helps me concentrate.","I've been part of a team and leader of the team. But wherever I've been, I've worked as if that was the only opportunity I had. I've never looked beyond that.","My friends call me a 'pace-setter.' Sometimes I am impatient, I think, but you must be fast and flexible in business because uncertainty is the only certainty in life.","After my grandfather began to be successful, he returned to the village where he was born and founded a primary school."],"Gunnar Myrdal":["To the great majority of white Americans, the Negro problem has distinctly negative connotations. It suggests something difficult to settle and equally difficult to leave alone. It is embarrassing. It makes for moral uneasiness.","In society, liberty for one may mean the suppression of liberty for others.","The Negro problem, like all other political problems, is fundamentally a moral issue. This is realism, not idealism. Those of my colleagues who believe that they are particularly 'hard boiled' because they overlook the fact that human beings are struggling for their consciences are simply unrealistic.","America is the one rich country with the biggest slums, the least democratic and least developed health system, and the most niggardly attitude against its old people.","Compared with members of other nations of Western civilization, the ordinary American is a rationalistic being, and there are close relations between his moralism and his rationalism. Even romanticism, transcendentalism, and mysticism tend to be, in the American culture, rational, pragmatic and optimistic.","During the three decades of its existence, the effectiveness of the United Nations has, on the whole, tended to decrease, particularly in the field of peace and security and, more generally, all issues in which the developed countries feel they have important stakes.","Toward the middle and end of the Fifties, West European countries became somewhat more important as providers of aid to underdeveloped countries. It was partly due to the prodding of the United States that these countries, as they regained economic viability, should shoulder their share of the aid burden.","I am often considered almost not a part of the profession of Establishment economists. I am even referred to as a sociologist. And by that, economists usually do not mean anything flattering.","The ordinary American is the opposite of a cynic. He is on the average more of a believer and a defender of the faith in humanity than the rest of the Occidentals. It is a relatively important matter to him to be true to his own ideals and to carry them out in actual life.","In my family, we don't die till we're 100 years old.","People don't realize the great happiness there is in living to be very old and together all the time."],"Gunter Blobel":["In basic research, the use of the electron microscope has revealed to us the complex universe of the cell, the basic unit of life.","I was 8 years old in the spring of 1945 when my family fled Silesia to escape the Russian army. On our way, we passed through Dresden. A few days later, it was firebombed. The fire was so bright that night that one could read a newspaper from the light, though we were many kilometers away.","After the near-total destruction of Dresden in the Allied fire-bombing of February 1945, few people believed that its beauty would ever return. Dresden's slow but steady comeback was thus met with great relief.","Driving through Dresden, I still remember the many palaces, happily decorated with cherubs and other symbols of the baroque era. The city made an indelible impression on me.","I'm always telling my students that if they can't explain what they are doing, to their grandmothers, then they probably don't understand it themselves.","In 1936, when I was born in the small Silesian village of Waltersdorf in the county of Sprottau in the then-eastern part of Germany, now part of Poland, the fine structure of the cell was still an enigma.","In the cold and snow-rich Silesian winters, there were hour-long rides on Sundays in horse-drawn sleighs to my maternal grandparent's farm to have lunch and to spend the afternoon. The house was a magnificent 18th-century manor house in the nearby Altgabel with a great hall that was decorated with hunting trophies.","Although I completed two years of internship in various small hospitals, I decided against continuing my medical training. I was much more fascinated by the unsolved problems of medicine than by practicing it.","A great deal has been learned about cell communication. The universal nature of cellular structure and organization in bacteria, plant and animal cells has been discovered.","The tremendous acquisition of basic knowledge will allow a much more rational treatment of cancer, viral infections, degenerative diseases and, most importantly, mental diseases.","The structure of many cellular macromolecules has been revealed at the atomic level using x-ray crystallography.","As soon as I heard there were people in Germany who wanted to restore the old part of Dresden, I wanted to help. Even before the Nobel, I had started this group, the Friends of Dresden. The destruction of Dresden made a big impression on me when I was a child, and I wanted to do this.","In the United States, the wealthy have a tradition of charity. But in Germany, the rich say, 'We pay taxes. It's enough.'","As long as we do not know how the cell works, we don't know the kind of havoc the AIDS virus creates in the cell.","It was one of the great pleasures of my life to donate the entire sum of the Nobel Prize, in memory of my sister Ruth Blobel, to the restoration of Dresden."],"Gunter Grass":["I'm always astonished by a forest. It makes me realise that the fantasy of nature is much larger than my own fantasy. I still have things to learn.","People change with time. There are things that happened to a person in his childhood and years later they seem to him alien and strange. I am trying to decipher that child. Sometimes he is a stranger to me. When you think about when you were 14, don't you feel a certain alienation?","Art is accusation, expression, passion. Art is a fight to the finish between black charcoal and white paper.","How do we prevent Iran developing an atomic bomb, when, on the American side, dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki is not recognised as a war crime?","My sister and I did not have our own rooms, or even a place to ourselves. In the living room, beyond the two windows, was a little corner where my books were kept, and other thing - my watercolors and so on. Often I had to imagine the things I needed. I learned very early to read amidst noise.","We already have the statistics for the future: the growth percentages of pollution, overpopulation, desertification. The future is already in place.","We cannot get by Auschwitz. We should not even try, as great as the temptation is, because Auschwitz belongs to us, is branded into our history, and - to our benefit! - has made possible an insight that could be summarized as, 'Now we finally know ourselves.'","The European Union arose on an economic foundation, and it turns out that even this is not a solid base. Cultural identity has been neglected.","Our minds aren't bound by a chronological corset. When thinking and dreaming, past, present and future are mixed up. That's also possible for a writer.","I did not volunteer for the Waffen SS, but was, as were thousands of my year group, conscripted. I did not then know as a 17-year-old that it was a criminal unit. I thought it was an elite unit.","Everybody knows how fallible memory can sometimes be. You remember certain fragments precisely, but as soon as you try to join the fragments together, for a story, there is a certain - not falsification, but a shifting.","I have found that words that are loaded with pathos and create a seductive euphoria are apt to promote nonsense.","Auschwitz speaks against even a right to self-determination that is enjoyed by all other peoples because one of the preconditions for the horror, besides other, older urges, was a strong and united Germany.","In general, I agree with Jacob Grimm and feel that we ought to permit changes and uncontrolled growth in language. Even though that also allows potentially threatening new words to develop, language needs the chance to constantly renew itself.","Lies that do not hurt, which are different from lies that protect oneself or hurt another person. That is not my business. But the truth is mostly very boring, and you can help it along with lies. There is no harm in that.","My relationship with Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm reaches far back into my childhood. I grew up with Grimm's fairy tales. I even saw a theater production of 'Tom Thumb' during Advent at the State Theater in Danzig, which my mother took me to see.","Homeland is something one becomes aware of only through its loss.","Even bad books are books and therefore sacred.","Art is uncompromising and life is full of compromises.","Information networks straddle the world. Nothing remains concealed. But the sheer volume of information dissolves the information. We are unable to take it all in.","I belonged to the generation that grew up under National Socialism, and was blinded and led astray - and allowed itself to be led astray.","How did it happen that an enlightened country like Germany was pulled into Nazism? That question has occupied me since 'The Tin Drum,' my first book. The story also shows that we can never know how a person's life will unfold; there is no guarantee that a person will do what is right and avoid what is not right.","If work and leisure are soon to be subordinated to this one utopian principle - absolute busyness - then utopia and melancholy will come to coincide: an age without conflict will dawn, perpetually busy - and without consciousness.","It is a wonderful thing in the process of writing when such paper characters are first sketched, and, when one is doing good work, from a certain point in time they come alive and start contradicting the author as well.","Melancholy has ceased to be an individual phenomenon, an exception. It has become the class privilege of the wage earner, a mass state of mind that finds its cause wherever life is governed by production quotas.","What I do is sometimes - at least in Germany - met with wounding campaigns. I always face the question: should I grow myself a thick skin and ignore it, or should I let myself be wounded? I've decided to be wounded, since, if I grew a thick skin, there are other things I wouldn't feel any more.","I have heard my fill of hurtful words. I think it's especially egregious when citizens like me, who point out abuses in their country, are referred to as 'do-gooders.' This is how a phrase that can be used to stop an argument dead becomes part of common usage.","Writers know that sometimes things are there in the drawer for decades before they finally come out and you are capable of writing about them.","When I am working on an epic-length book, the writing process is fairly long. It takes from four to five years to get through all the drafts. The book is done when I am exhausted.","For me, writing, drawing, and political activism are three separate pursuits; each has its own intensity. I happen to be especially attuned to and engaged with the society in which I live. Both my writing and my drawing are invariably mixed up with politics, whether I want them to be or not.","No idea stays pure. Even the flowering of art isn't pure. And the sun has spots.","I was brought up Catholic and know the stench of the Catholic Church. I moved away from religion early, but the impression remains.","If we take into account the existence of our planet, we have to recognise that we are guests that spend a short and very determined period in this world, and all we leave behind is nuclear waste.","Art is so wonderfully irrational, exuberantly pointless, but necessary all the same. Pointless and yet necessary, that's hard for a puritan to understand.","Believing: it means believing in our own lies. And I can say that I am grateful that I got this lesson very early.","The job of a citizen is to keep his mouth open.","Often I had to imagine the things I needed. I learned very early to read amidst noise. And so I started writing and drawing at an early age.","As a child I was a great liar. Fortunately my mother liked my lies. I promised her marvelous things.","I don't believe in writing at night because it comes too easily. When I read it in the morning it's not good. I need daylight to begin. Between nine and ten o'clock I have a long breakfast with reading and music.","I had an uncle who was a postal official at the Polish post office in Gdansk. He was one of the defenders of the Polish postal service and, after it capitulated, was shot by the Germans under the provisions of martial law. Suddenly he was no longer a member of the family, and we were no longer allowed to play with his children.","Everyone is born into a certain era. I wouldn't want to see anyone faced with the circumstances that prevailed at the time, when there were few or no alternatives.","I catch myself judging myself as that 13-year-old boy, who, of course, rightfully points out that he is only a child. And my membership - well, I was drafted into the Waffen-SS and didn't exactly volunteer, which was just as idiotic. I wanted to be on the submarines and then ended up with the Waffen-SS.","I was assigned to the Waffen-SS but was never involved in any crime. Besides, I always felt the need to write about my experiences in a larger context one day. This has only developed recently, now that I have overcome my inner aversion to writing an autobiography in the first place, specifically one having to do with my younger years.","I think it's a shame that we have 'Bild' like you have the 'Sun'. Now serious newspapers like 'FAZ' and 'Spiegel' use a bit of the tone of 'Bild.' This is terrible.","I have often supported Israel, I have often visited the country and want the country to exist and at last find peace with its neighbours.","A writer must face up to the test of reality, including political reality, and that can't be done if he keeps his distance. A literary style cultivated like a hothouse plant may show a certain artificial purity, but it won't really be pure.","Prose, poetry, and drawings stand side by side in a very democratic way in my work.","I can only write a book like 'The Tin Drum' or 'From the Diary of a Snail' at a special period of my life. The books came about because of how I felt and thought at the time.","Memory likes to play hide-and-seek, to crawl away. It tends to hold forth, to dress up, often needlessly. Memory contradicts itself; pedant that it is, it will have its way.","I remember when I was writing 'The Tin Drum,' I had the totally misguided idea of giving Oskar Matzerath a sister, and he just wouldn't have it. There was no space for a sister, yet I had the character of the sister in my head. In fact I used her in later novels, in 'Cat and Mouse' and 'Dog Years,' Tulla Pokriski.","I've always been surrounded by children - never bothered by their noise.","Over the years, I had something in principle against autobiographical writing altogether because memory plays tricks on us, and we also tend to reinvent ourselves. But there comes an age when one begins to observe life, and there are things that need time to mature, also in terms of literary form.","With drawing, I am acutely aware of creating something on a sheet of paper. It is a sensual act, which you cannot say about the act of writing. In fact, I often turn to drawing to recover from the writing.","I have seen and drawn dying, poisoned worlds. I published a book of drawings called 'Death of Wood' about one such world, on the border between the Federal Republic of Germany and what was then still the German Democratic Republic."],"Gunther Schuller":["So this anchoring in some way, in some important way in the past without repeating the past, but on the basis of the past building something new: that is what is important.","Well, because music is my life and music is not work for me.","So now, thirty years, forty years later, I mean, I could find a whole orchestra of a thousand to put these things together in New York City alone. In those days, if I could scrape up twenty musicians to do this it was something extraordinary.","You know, I'm not gonna take my money with me to heaven or hell, wherever I'm going. So I want to do something good with it even though my means are very limited. I'm no millionaire!","The record company started as an adjunct to that, to give young composers their first recorded performances; to give young musicians their first debut on a recording. These are all things that big record companies would never touch because there is no money in it!","That was more or less coincidental in the sense that my parents wanted me to come back to New York because that's the center of musical activity still to this day, more or less, and so I auditioned for the Metropolitan Opera.","I would like to read some books: I don't have time; I would like to continue working on my autobiography.","I don't hate work, composing is not work for me, it's my pleasure; it's my life. So why should I stop? If something is pleasurable and exciting and rewarding, why should one stop?","But somehow, I felt no inclination to be interested in it in any amateur way, let alone professional, until suddenly I became interested. And the first thing I did was to compose: not play an instrument, but to compose.","Because I have sixty years of being a professional composer, conductor, musician, whatever, and you develop a lot of friendships and you get involved with a lot of sort of long-term commitments and obligations.","As rich as Cincinnati was in live music, New York was even more.","As long as I'm healthy and can keep going that's what I'll do.","And it is this sense that some of us have to contribute to the culture, to the society in ways that may hurt financially, so what? We do it because we are born to do it, we feel we have no other choice and so be it.","After the war, once the bop revolution had taken hold, there were all kinds of young musicians, talented young musicians, who were ready for this fusion of classical and jazz."],"Guo Guangchang":["You have to maintain the balance between fast growth and smooth growth. It's like driving a car and knowing when to balance the gas pedal and the brake.","Our goal is to upgrade the life of China's middle class. We all want to live better.","Keeping the balance of fast-growing and smooth-growing is always important. It's almost an art.","The aim of tai chi is not to strike first to gain dominance over an opponent, but to wait and hit at the right moment.","No one holds a permanent speed advantage in the market due to the limits of human intelligence and vision. Your advantage comes from your ability to feel the change faster and take decisive action faster.","I feel that doing business is just like practising Buddhism. Money is not your only purpose. Your purpose is to make things better for other people, and in the end, money will come as a result.","By making a company successful, you can provide more employment, and, if you treat your staff well, then your business itself becomes a charity.","Our focus going forward is on sectors where the life of China's middle class can be upgraded: health, travel, leisure, education, and the Internet. We call it marrying China's growth with global resources.","We have in-depth knowledge about Chinese industries. We know what's driving the country's economic growth.","From a business perspective, we are trying to propose some suggestions to the government. Not only to benefit Fosun, but to benefit all private enterprises, especially proposals to help small to medium-sized companies.","Club Med is very suitable for a Chinese lifestyle.","Chinese society is organised around the family unit.","From a tourist's point of view, you finally have time to travel, but you need to spend your time looking after your child. Club Med takes care of the entire family."],"Gurinder Chadha":["Third-generation Indians love maintaining their cultural traditions, but they can also go down the pub, shop till they drop, do whatever anyone else does.","I was a good Indian girl, but naughty in that I would often sneak out of the back door and into the garden and go off with my friends when I should have been at home cooking or cleaning.","Australians have a fantastic sense of humour and incredible taste. I was there for 'Bend It Like Beckham,' and I had a great time. Aussies loved it, and I think 'Bride & Prejudice' is going to do well, too, because it's all about having a good time.","I am not afraid to be a pioneer. When a door is ajar, you need to open it fully. And once you are in that room, you need to see what other doors there might be and where they might lead.","I was a journalist when I made 'I'm British But...' I'd seen how important the media was in terms of defining Indians - after the riots in the '80s, I was like, 'Oh my God!'","Indian films never show cows. When you go to India, the most noticeable thing is the cows. Everywhere you look, there's cows walking around! Just by introducing the idea of animals - livestock walking around - suddenly makes it more real.","I remember a picture on the front page of the 'Sun' during the Brixton riots: a rasta guy with a petrol bomb, and a headline saying something like: 'The Future of Britain.' And I thought: 'Wow! Look at the power of that image,' and I wanted to get behind the camera to make these people three-dimensional.","All my films are about kind of being seen to be one thing when you're actually something else, and the power of the female spirit to make things work your way on your terms. Which is what I do.","Writing film scripts is the hardest thing in the world. A script has to go to five or six drafts, and you need the feedback of other people and to keep coming back with a fresh eye, honing it down.","I knew from an early age that people didn't see the different sides of me. I formulated a kind of bi-cultural identity quite early, and I was always very comfortable with it, but I knew people didn't quite see that.","I know it sounds really weedy, but we are all children who seek approval from our parents.","The fact that it's hard to create an original British musical doesn't mean you shouldn't try.","There are very few people who are Asian who have the kind of global reach that I have, not just with Asians but with non-Asians. I've worked hard for what my name represents, my brand, not just in Britain but around the world.","One of the best things about the award season is that when a British film succeeds at the Oscars and BAFTAs, such as 'Slumdog Millionaire' in 2009 and 'The King's Speech' this year, the British public get right behind it with an immense sense of national pride.","It's not simply that British films do well at the box office and generate revenue, it's that they provide a window to the world of what Britain and its culture is about.","Our films have the ability to tell global audiences who we are, and this is something the government should feel compelled to protect. My film, 'Bend it Like Beckham,' for example, would not have been made without the backing and support of the U.K. Film Council.","I love 'I'm British But...' It's such a sweet, innocent, open-hearted film, and it has the sort of openness that I still aspire to with everything I do. It wears its heart, head, everything on its sleeve.","I'm absolutely delighted because I'm part of the process that has made Asians very much part of the mainstream fabric of Britain, whereas, when I first started, we were completely on the margin.","'Up the Junction' went on to inform my love of British social realism. It was the first film I saw of this ilk, a very stark, visceral reflection of England, an England I didn't necessarily feel a part of but that I knew was out there. You could almost smell the bread and butter and cabbage.","'Up the Junction' really made me understand the power of cinema to create a vivid sense of a community. When I went on to make 'Bhaji on the Beach,' it was this sense I tried to recreate.","I tell stories about people audiences might think they have nothing in common with, then they emotionally connect with them and find they're not different at all.","One of the head guys at Disney categorically said to me, 'We don't want to make children's films any more. We want to make films that are going to appeal to all quadrants.' Hence you have films like 'Shrek' and all the Pixar stuff, which is designed to suit everybody.","DVDs have their place, but the cinema is a tangible, emotional experience that I would hate my children not to have.","For British cinema to survive, you really need a British film culture, and it's got to start down there, with young kids watching films in the cinema - so they can be transported to a different world.","Britain has nurtured me and made me able to make movies that have travelled round the world.","The only time I used to feel like an outsider was when I first went to India.","If you tell me I can't do something, that's the worst thing to tell me. And that's what I tell girls, and what Beckham's about: you can do it, you can do it better, and you can do it in the way you want.","You'd be surprised how hard it is getting the human emotional arc in a script to work. Ultimately a director stands and falls by their ability to do that.","If you want to be a director, work with writers and find different ways of telling stories with film, then do a course. This way you can consolidate what you've learnt and use the course to go further.","One of the things I want to do with 'Desi Rascals' is go a bit deeper into the characters and their family lives and have a bit more heart and a bit more inter-generational story-telling, so it's not all about young people.","'Viceroy' is the first British film about the Raj and the transfer of power from Britain to India made by a British Indian director. It is a British film made from an Indian perspective.","I really thought I couldn't be a mum. We had tried several times with IVF,, and it hadn't worked and we'd given up in a way. We both thought, 'You know what, that's that. It's not going to happen - let's move on.'","My pregnancy was great, but the last three weeks were manic because my blood pressure was going up and up.","When you're told that as a filmmaker of colour, the stories you want to tell aren't commercial enough, then you start thinking, 'I'm going to tell them anyway.'","I saw 'Billy Elliot' again, and what I loved about it was the way it had become a social document, a reminder of what happened with the mining communities in the '80s. And I thought, 'Everyone keeps wanting me to make a sequel to 'Beckham,' but maybe a musical remake is the answer, embracing all this theatricality.'","The great thing about musicals is that they transcend race.","As I grew up, I always refused to cook Indian food very vehemently, and to this day, I don't cook chapatis at home. I'd always say, 'Why do I have to do it? Why don't the men do it?'","I went to L.A., and I was on two different studio movies at Fox and Sony, but they were never made in the end. When the second one wasn't happening, I ended up doing an episode of 'Who Do You Think You Are?' for the BBC, and went on a roots trip from England to Kenya, India, and pre-partition India in Pakistan, where my family originally came from.","Constantly, I've been asked to make a sequel to 'Beckham.' However, I thought a West End show was the proper way to go. Once we made the show, I wanted to make sure that I embraced the West End genre rather than just put the film on stage.","I've been wanting for a long time to create a show which allowed me to show the British Asian community in a truly three-dimensional way, exploring the relationships between generations and what it means to be British and Asian as values become fluid.","Southall Broadway, in west London, has been a constant part of my life from the day I arrived in England as a baby from Kenya in 1962. My parents rented a room in one of the terraces off the Broadway, and I've seen it change from an ordinary English high street to what is now 'Little India.' with a confident Asian community.","I can't stand films where parents are portrayed as old and doddery, and ignore their kids.","My films do have a big following among young girls, and I want to instill confidence in them, a sense of self-appreciation - to make them feel they can be spirited and say what they feel.","I use humour a lot because humour is a great equaliser. Everyone laughs at the same things if you set them up properly, and that makes everybody equal. At the end of the day, I see my job as being there to entertain as well as inform and provoke.","If I'm in a gathering of filmmakers, I'm first and foremost a British Indian; if I'm in a gathering of British Indians, I'm a woman director. There are so many sides to who I am that I change all the time.","The more I make films, the more I feel less inclined to talk about them and just let people watch them. I feel that the pictures are telling the story, and I can't really add anything except just talking about the technicalities of what happened on the day.","On the outside, America looks like this great melting pot, but on the inside, there's this segregation in American cinema. Why does a Latino film have to be for Latinos? Why is a black film just for black people? Why?","Bollywood is a cinema of vibrant contradictions, which works when it seems it shouldn't.","Once I started writing the screenplay of 'Bride & Prejudice,' I was convinced Jane Austen was a Punjabi in her previous birth."],"Gurjeet Singh":["The biggest challenge in big data today is asking the right questions of data. There are so many questions to ask that you don't have the time to ask them all, so it doesn't even make sense to think about where to start your analysis.","To learn something from your data, the forming of a hypothesis lies with the human being, which turns into a query, which becomes a result. The problem is that there are too many queries to make, too many questions to ask.","The world is looking for big data scientists, and there just aren't enough to go around.","The answers to today's most important scientific, business, and social problems lie in data.","I'm going to say something rather controversial. Big data, as people understand it today, is just a bigger version of small data. Fundamentally, what we're doing with data has not changed; there's just more of it.","The number of queries in a large dataset is exponential, and it's growing exponentially. No matter how fast you make your system, you're never going to be able to get all that information.","We don't use the term 'big data' - not on our website, not with customers. Saying it sets up expectations, the wrong expectations.","People believe the best way to learn from the data is to have a hypothesis and then go check it, but the data is so complex that someone who is working with a data set will not know the most significant things to ask. That's a huge problem.","Technologies like Ayasdi's exist now to automatically discover information from data without having someone making guesses up front.","If you know people with Type 2 diabetes, there's a high likelihood they will have different medication regimes and different lifestyle options. When we label all these various types as the same thing, we treat them the same way, and they should not be treated the same way.","Every company today is a data company whether they realize it or not.","Data is cost. It takes money to create data, store it, clean it, and throw resources at it to learn anything from it.","I lived in fear that other engineers would stop me in the street and ask me a math question, and I wouldn't know the answer.","For me, the most exciting aspect of my success is how the insights that Ayasdi's technology has found in data can truly impact people's lives.","My mission is to bring the power of big data insights and analytics to every company.","The power of Ayasdi is its unique ability to automatically discover insights - regardless of complexity - without asking questions.","Ayasdi's customers can finally learn the answers to questions that they didn't know to ask in the first place."],"Guru Nanak":["Let no man in the world live in delusion. Without a Guru none can cross over to the other shore.","I bow at His Feet constantly, and pray to Him, the Guru, the True Guru, has shown me the Way.","Let God's grace be the mosque, and devotion the prayer mat. Let the Quran be the good conduct.","Only fools argue whether to eat meat or not. They don't understand truth, nor do they meditate on it. Who can define what is meat and what is plant? Who knows where the sin lies, being a vegetarian or a non-vegetarian?","There are worlds and more worlds below them, and there are a hundred thousand skies over them. No one has been able to find the limits and boundaries of God. If there be any account of God, then alone the mortal can write the same; but God's account does not finish, and the mortal himself dies while still writing.","From its brilliancy everything is illuminated.","Even Kings and emperors with heaps of wealth and vast dominion cannot compare with an ant filled with the love of God.","There is but One God. His name is Truth; He is the Creator. He fears none; he is without hate. He never dies; He is beyond the cycle of births and death. He is self-illuminated. He is realized by the kindness of the True Guru. He was True in the beginning; He was True when the ages commenced and has ever been True. He is also True now.","Sing the songs of joy to the Lord, serve the Name of the Lord, and become the servant of His servants.","I am neither a child, a young man, nor an ancient; nor am I of any caste.","Through shallow intellect, the mind becomes shallow, and one eats the fly, along with the sweets.","Alone let him constantly meditate in solitude on that which is salutary for his soul, for he who meditates in solitude attains supreme bliss.","If the people use the wealth bestowed on them by God for themselves alone or for treasuring it, it is like a corpse. But if they decide to share it with others, it becomes sacred food.","Me, the bard out of work, the Lord has applied to His service. In the very beginning, He gave me the order to sing His praises night and day. The Master summoned the minstrel to His True Court. He clothed me with the robe of His true honour and eulogy. Since then, the True Name had become my ambrosial food.","Riches cannot be gathered without sin and evil means.","By singing the Guru's hymns, I, the minstrel spread the Lord's glory. Nanak, by praising the True Name, I have obtained the perfect Lord.","The production of children, the nurture of those born, and the daily life of men, of these matters woman is visibly the cause.","That one plant should be sown and another be produced cannot happen; whatever seed is sown, a plant of that kind even comes forth.","Thou has a thousand eyes and yet not one eye; Thou host a thousand forms and yet not one form.","Asceticism doesn't lie in mere words; He is an ascetic who treats everyone alike. Asceticism doesn't lie in visiting burial places; it lies not in wandering about nor in bathing at places of pilgrimage. Asceticism is to remain pure amidst impurities.","If there is one God, then there is only His way to attain Him, not another. One must follow that way and reject the other. Worship not him who is born only to die, but Him who is eternal and is contained in the whole universe.","Asceticism doesn't lie in ascetic robes or in walking staff nor in the ashes. Asceticism doesn't lie in the earring nor in the shaven head nor blowing a conch. Asceticism lies in remaining pure amidst impurities.","One cannot comprehend Him through reason, even if one reasoned for ages.","I am not the born; how can there be either birth or death for me?","Whatever kind of seed is sown in a field, prepared in due season, a plant of that same kind, marked with the peculiar qualities of the seed, springs up in it.","Owing to ignorance of the rope the rope appears to be a snake; owing to ignorance of the Self the transient state arises of the individualized, limited, phenomenal aspect of the Self.","Offspring, the due performance on religious rites, faithful service, highest conjugal happiness and heavenly bliss for the ancestors and oneself, depend on one's wife alone.","Whatever be the qualities of the man with whom a woman is united according to the law, such qualities even she assumes, like a river, united with the ocean."],"Gus Kahn":["I'll see you in my dreams.","I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else."],"Gus Kenworthy":["I have felt so insecure about my body at times. I've been on every end of the spectrum. I felt like I was too skinny and wished I could be muscular. I've felt like I was chubby and wanted to be skinny. I think everybody suffers from body image issues. I might exude confidence sometimes, but I'm pretty insecure.","When you're able to love and appreciate and take pride with yourself, that makes everything easier. It makes it easier to train, it makes it easier to be in the gym, and it makes it easier for everyone else to accept and love you.","I hope that any gay kids see me as beacon of light, not just in sport but in general.","The only way to really change perceptions, to break down barriers, break down homophobia, is through representation. That's definitely not something I had as a kid. I never saw a gay athlete kissing their boyfriend at the Olympics. I think if I had, it would've made it easier for me.","When you're able to be honest with yourself about who you are and finally can present your authentic true self to the world, you feel so much better about yourself, and it makes it easier for everyone else to feel better about you.","I've always been someone who's had to compartmentalize my life because I was in the closet, and I was in fear of outing myself. I always had so much going on in my mind and couldn't share it with anyone, so I actually feel like, now that I'm out, I have less to compartmentalize.","The Olympics is a cool opportunity to represent our country, which is amazing. But I have another community I am competing for, and that is the LGBT community.","You can be gay and be proud of that and not have to worry about being unsuccessful or unaccepted.","I'm proud to be from a country where I can speak up.","Jet lag is tough, to be honest. For me, it's much easier to force yourself to stay awake.","I want to be the guy that's taking names, on the podium, and winning events.","Dating in the closet is torture. It's one of the most difficult things, especially if you are completely closeted.","If everyone could see everyone else the way their mom saw them, it would be a much better place for all of us.","All I can really say is to encourage anybody who's in the closet to come out, and congratulate anyone who has.","I'm putting in the time to make sure that my body is ready to compete at the top level.","Figure skating, especially the longer performances, are such a feat. It requires so much stamina and is so beautiful.","I realize how fortunate I am to have been able to make a life and career out of skiing.","I love Kim Chi the drag queen from 'RuPaul's Drag Race,' but I'm not sure about the food.","I didn't even ski halfpipe until I was 14 because the resort where I lived didn't have one. So it wasn't always my favorite event, but I grew into it.","I don't think there's a direct correlation between my sexuality and my skiing ability. But I think because I was so concerned about it being found out, it was a distraction.","I don't listen to music when I ski - I find it distracting - but I will sing to myself before I go to just get my mind out of what I'm doing and relax a little bit.","I've gotten a lot of messages from kids struggling with their identity and sexuality, whether it's because they're in a religious family or a small town or a sport that's not very accepting. I've had a ton of outreach, and I've tried to get back to kids as best I could.","I always felt like I had something to prove, like I had to work twice as hard to make sure I got it. I knew I didn't want to be a good skier. I wanted to be the best.","I was insecure and ashamed. Unless you're gay, being gay has never been looked at as being cool. And I wanted to be cool.","More than I've wanted anything, I've wanted to do well at the X Games.","I don't really have a specific Olympic crush. There were a couple of guys during the Olympics in Sochi that were super fit. And during the summer games, any of the sports where people have their shirts off if they're diving or swimming or whatever, it's like eye candy.","The world that I would want to get into would be acting. In the beginning, I would do stuff as myself if I had the opportunity to host events - host, like, a talk show. Something like that, I think, would be super amazing.","I'm not one of those people who can eat whatever I want and never go to the gym. I have to work hard for any results I see.","I don't think you necessarily have to be crazy-fit for freeskiing. So much of the sport has to do with agility and nimbleness and flexibility and other things. It's a lot of muscle memory - it's more like dance, in a way - it's technique more than strength or endurance.","I've had knee trouble, and I worry about my shoulder, but I think my weakest link is my head. A helmet can only do so much, and I have seen the effects of brain injuries. That is a big fear. I think everyone's weakest link is their brain because it's their most fragile link.","When I was in the closet, I had so much pressure on my shoulders. When I came out, that was actually the first moment I felt relieved of those stresses. It really showed in my skiing.","I think it's so important to have visibility and to break down stereotypes and stigmas and everything that people are so attached to.","For me, as a kid, I always felt like being gay was something that was going make people turn on me.","I would honestly say the biggest thing for cold weather is a good face moisturizer with SPF. Winters are harsh, wind chill's real, and, a lot of the time, it's a really dry climate, and so your lips will crack, your face will start to get dry, your nose will peel; it's easy to get sunburnt, windburnt.","I always have at least one book with me. I try and read a book a month.","I've been through stretches of my life where I've been super focused on what I'm eating, and then you're on the road, and you end up eating a lot of carbs and tacos.","I'm not super superstitious, but if I listen to a song and then I do well, then that becomes my song for however long it works for.","I spend so much of my time on the road and traveling.","Since I came out of the closet, I've gotten to just really be myself and feel authentic and honest and genuine. It's just been a huge relief for me competitively.","My mom has been there for me in moments where I definitely needed her the most, and she has this inherent way of knowing exactly what to say and exactly how to talk to me, whatever the situation.","Having an Olympic medal validates that you can be a successful freeskier... It's like a credential that sticks with you the rest of your life.","Hopefully, it gets to a point where, down the line, people don't have to come out.","I don't think that one thing defines me, but I know that by coming out the way that I did, sort of almost pioneering it in action sports - to take that stand - that it's always going to be a label that is stuck with me, and I know that I'll always be the 'gay skier,' and it actually doesn't bother me.","I have the LGBT audience behind me, and there's all these people that I want to make proud, and I want to do well aside from just myself.","I think the Olympics are a time for the world to come together and put aside differences, but we're also coming to represent ourselves, our communities, and our countries, so I think it's important to stand up and be a voice.","Growing up, I always wanted kids, and that was one of the things that made it hard for me to accept being gay, but now I know it's totally an option to have kids.","My diet doesn't change regardless of whether or not I'm competing. It's not that strict, either. I try not to eat too much dessert or too many sugary things, like bread or pasta. But I'm not crazy, and I'll eat pasta if that's what someone if making. It's all about trying to find a balance and eat healthy.","The thought of being the first openly gay male ever to compete in the Winter Olympics - I totally embrace that.","I was so stressed in the closet. In an interview, I was scared they were going to ask me about a crush, or the type of girl I liked, or whatever it was. And I was going to have to lie by omission. It was always in the back of my mind.","Miley Cyrus followed me, tweeted at me. We started messaging; we traded numbers. She's become like a friend. She's super supportive of me being gay.","I chose a public platform to come out. I wanted to have an impact with it.","Someone coming out as gay shouldn't be newsworthy; it shouldn't be warranting a magazine cover or anything like that, which I had as my story for coming out.","I'm representing the LGBT community, and I want to do well for them.","If people are hiding their sexuality, they don't really get their full selves, so you can sometimes feel like you're presenting sort of like a fogged version of yourself.","My family's dog, when I was growing up, was an adopted dog that I got in a shelter for my birthday. I've always felt really strongly about adopting animals and trying to save animals' lives.","There are so many animals in shelters that need homes. Rather than going to a breeder and buying a dog, or a puppy mill or anything like that, I've always been a big fan of adoption.","I wound up adopting two dogs from Sochi. It wasn't really me who brought them home as much as it was one of my best friends, Robin Macdonald, who was out there with me.","The chance of messing up and falling significantly increases when you're flipping through the air three times while spinning and trying to grab your skis.","I don't ever train half-pipe except for the short training sessions during events, and because of that, I have a really hard time consistently putting my runs down smoothly.","One of the most exciting and unique parts of slopestyle is that every course is unique. You don't really know what to expect when you show up at an event, and it's always fun trying to put a run together.","I would probably say Breckenridge has the best park out of any resort. They build the best jumps, they have fun rails, and the pipe is well kept, too.","It's a life I would have never been able to foresee for myself, but I'm so grateful for it, and I really just loved skiing as a kid, and it's crazy how far it's taken me.","It shows more courage to leave the house as a trans person than Trump has ever had to show.","I'm actually sort of shocked that I was able to get a medal in 2014 and really have any of the success I had before because as soon as I came out, it was like a whole new world for me, and I felt so free, so confident, that it's actually shocking that I was able to compete any other way.","I think that being in the closet is really hard. It takes a toll on your mind. It takes a toll on you. I think it just makes every aspect of your life more difficult.","As a kid, I just felt like I didn't really have anyone to look up to that I felt like I could really relate to, someone that was out and gay and also competing in sports and finding success.","I'm so proud that now you can exist as a gay man and be an Olympian, and it can be beneficial rather than negative. So it's amazing. And I just think I feel so liberated now that I've been out of the closet for a while, and so I'm free in that I just get to be myself, speak freely, act freely, and I think that I am competing confidently.","I look at photos of the Sochi Olympics - even though it sometimes seems like it was just yesterday - that photo doesn't even look like me. It looks like a child. I don't even recognize myself.","I love that our country is one where you have the freedom to protest and to stand up for what you believe in and speak on it.","Even if you're 'the gay guy,' if you're winning events, you're still winning events.","I definitely carry a little bit of a burden with me, being a gay athlete going to the Olympics. I think that there's pressure on me... It presents an amazing opportunity, and I think that it kind of gives us a chance to shed people's misconceptions and just kind of, like, break down barriers.","Competitors, even friends that would say things that were so homophobic, and - I don't think that they realized necessarily the impact that it was having on me, because I was in the closet, and I think that that's what made me really scared to come out.","You don't want to be defined by one thing. But at the same point... When you are the first in something, that's gonna kinda be the title that sticks. And after Sochi, I was, like, the dog guy. Now I'm the gay guy, and it's fine by me.","When we have people elected into office that believe in conversion therapy and are trying to strip trans rights in the military and do these things that are directly attacking the LGBT community, I have no patience.","Getting to be authentic is so liberating.","I spent 24 years in the closet wanting to talk so desperately about who I was and what I am but too afraid to.","For anyone who says 'Who cares if you're gay? It's 2018,' well, a lot of people care because a lot of people had the opportunity to be out, and there's been a lot of fear surrounding it. This is the first time we're seeing representation, and because of that, it is a big deal.","The Olympics is all about inclusion, coming together for sport. That's the footprint I want to leave."],"Gus O'Donnell":["It's amazing what you can get on open source now if you actually use the right search engines to find the material.","The use of the Internet, the use of Twitter, the way protest movements developed... This is a different world.","It is our job to work for the government of the day and so that means working for Gordon Brown as Prime Minister, and we need to do those preparations just to be sure that we're ready for whoever you, the British public, elect and that's core to our civil service values over the last 150 years.","Civil servants are fully aware of the challenges the British economy faces. They are, after all, working tirelessly and professionally to support the coalition government through the current challenges, every day, and in every part of Britain.","There are too many countries where the values we take for granted in our civil servants simply do not exist. Seeing these values in action, applied with dedication by hardworking individuals, makes me proud to lead a service that is making life better for millions across Britain.","I'm a bit of a freak for evidence-based analysis. I strongly believe in data.","If you want to understand what's happening to the situation in a town in Afghanistan, go down to the market. Is it vibrant? Is it safe? That will tell you an enormous amount about the security situation."],"Gus Van Sant":["The area of teenage life is not necessarily rarefied; we've all gone through that period. It's not as rarefied as a western or a space adventure or a gangster film, but it has its own dynamic.","I'm thinking of remaking 'Psycho' again. Doing a third remake. The idea this time is to really change it - we're talking about doing a punk rocker setting.","Free time keeps me going. It's just something that's always been a part of my life. I was originally a painter, and I made films sort of as an extension of that, and then I started to try to make dramatic films because the early films were experimental films.","There's a lot of films that have relatively rigid road maps because they have a script and others that are less rigid because they have less of a script, like 'Elephant.' The road map becomes more interpretive, maybe, than one with a detailed script. Editing-wise, they all have their problems.","My art teacher in junior high was a very out gay man and a mentor to me. He would tell us about Greenwich Village and show us the 'Village Voice' and describe his life, but it was all sort of subversive and below the radar.","Free time keeps me going.","Yeah, Kubrick's a big influence. In something like 'A Clockwork Orange,' he is trying to use the practical light - I mean, at least he says that in his interviews, like they're not using traditionally Hollywood lights. In 'Elephant' we basically used no lights; we never really adjusted.","Modern-day cinema takes the form of a sermon. You don't get to think, you only get to receive information.","Even when you're making a movie about life, death is a presence, and I guess it's part of my dramatic viewpoint. I'm not sure why exactly.","Now the music industry is sort of like a Craigslist venture, right? Where you're making your own records and selling them online.","Usually, when I read something, I'm looking for the story first. And then, when I re-read it, I check every part of it to see whether every scene is necessary. You imagine yourself watching the movie, to see whether or not you're losing the through-line of the story.","My family moved a lot as a kid. We started in Colorado, where I lived for five years. We moved to Chicago for two years, to San Francisco for one year, Connecticut for seven, Oregon for a couple years, and then I went to school. So I was always moving, I'm still always moving.","I did 'Mala Noche' as a way to do something that was outside of the system, because I was outside of the system, and I deliberately chose material that Hollywood wouldn't touch in a million years.","The artist himself is actually the subject in everything after, say, 1900. Eventually, art becomes so removed from the community that you have to know about the artist before you can even look at the painting, because there is a conceptual idea going on.","If I'm diagnosed with cancer I might become despondent, but someone young might not, and they might need connections with somebody outside their circle of family because their family is so despondent.","I was once a shameless, full-time dope fiend.","For all the boredom the straight life brings, it's not too bad.","If you don't have the story and the unfolding of the trajectory of the saga, it's like getting in a car and not having any gas.","I've told people who have just started to make a film that the one thing you might experience is this feeling that everybody is conspiring against you, because you're not necessarily able to tell what's real and what's not.","Wong Kar-Wai is a really great inspiration. He's always referred to as the Jimi Hendrix of filmmaking.","Even when you're making a movie about life, death is a presence, and I guess it's part of my dramatic viewpoint. I'm not sure why exactly. Maybe I'm drawn to it as a story element.","I find it interesting, the different rules that apply to journalism and drama, even though journalism has become more and more about entertainment, and entertainment has become more and more about journalism.","There is a way that a younger person can accept the inevitable problem that they're going to die, whereas somebody a little bit older might be overcome.","I have my ideas of what a good documentary is, but drama is a different animal because you're arranging everything.","When I grew up in the '60s, we were actually dominated by this, you know, sort of conforming '50s culture, even though we were like trying to express our own culture, like, the dominant culture was the thing that was forming us. And I think that that's true today.","Because I didn't have brothers, I was always interested in the kids down the street that had four brothers in their family, so I became one of them - but it was not my family. I've always been attracted to temporary families. They tend to be lost characters.","Gay marriage is the last bastion of, to me... as a legal, ceremonial, sentimental and religious side, it's one of the last steps. Retaining your job being one of the earlier steps, like, not getting kicked out of your job because you're gay.","There is a common theme, though, in the stories I have told, which are usually associations of characters or families that are formed outside of a family circle.","I don't think American independent films have ever really been particularly experimental, except for the original guys from the '60s who were huge influences, like Stan Brakhage, Robert Breer, and Stan van der Beek. They were the true independents.","Death Valley is really wide-open - it's bigger than Rhode Island - and it's less a part of California than an ungoverned territory, so there's lots of weird cops-and-robbers stuff going on.","With 'Good Will Hunting,' Miramax made certain the recruited audience wasn't expecting to laugh at Robin Williams like they normally do. From my limited experience, you can really blow test screenings by conducting them in the wrong way.","The rules of suspense are that you do know, and you just don't know when. In the Hitchcock rules of suspense, you are supposed to know that there is a bomb on the bus that might blow up, and then it becomes very tense - but if you don't know that there's a bomb and it just blows up, then it's just a surprise.","I think that for the actors, the last thing that they want is a director that's not watching, a director that goes 'Okay, it sounded good to me,' and they were doing something else or preoccupied with something else because they were worried about the light changing.","In rare cases, I've had music before I shot the movie. I think that for 'Good Will Hunting' I had an Elliot Smith record or a couple of them and I just somehow felt like the sound had something to it that reminded me of the story. So in that case there was music beforehand.","The reason I know about 'Tomb Raider' is from when I was researching 'Elephant.' It was 1999, and I was trying to research the Columbine-massacre kids, and they had played video games, and I, at the time, had never really seen one. It was a world I didn't know.","Once you're directing, you're kind of in a certain mode, where you're taking whatever is on the page and forming it into the film that you think it might want to be. So whether it's my writing or not, I still try to work with it in the same way.","When I was 14, I felt very rundown; I had a home to go to, but I felt like I was 60 or something, older than I feel now. And I don't know if it's something that happens at 14, or whether it was adolescence or whether I was gay, or closeted gay, or whatever it was, I felt that.","In high school, I read 'Silas Marner' and I was very attracted to this character - he was very rundown and he'd just stop, and things would happen around him.","I'd come into filmmaking as a painter so, for me, making 'Good Will Hunting' was experimental because I didn't know how to do it.","I think over the course of 14 films, I'm returning to a place that I know to tell a story... the same way Spielberg returned to fantasy, Lucas returned to the 'Star Wars' saga, or John Ford returned to the western.","I don't usually direct actors in the classic sense of that word. Instead, I try to remind the characters before the shoot what's going on in a very simple way. I then watch them, their inventions as actors, approving or not approving what they're doing.","You're following your track, the story, your only plan, your map for the audience, and all the other stuff is, like, the fun stuff: the costumes, the locations, the set-dressing and the actors. They can all be variable as you like if you stick - however roughly - to the path.","I think that what I'm attracted to is people who are wild. But the self-destructive side comes out of the wild side. The wildness is very different from me. That's why I think I like it.","One of the things that is devastating is I realise I haven't been living a different life than when I was, like, 12. I'm shocked at how reclusive I've been since then. I was unaware of it until recently.","My department is to get actors to do stuff.","The dark comedies tend to be in a non-releasable area. There can be romantic comedies. There can be dramas. But there's no 'dark comedy' inbox for the advertising.","If a movie isn't released, it's one thing, but if you know it will be, it's nice to have closure and see it come out.","There's always a risk if you don't do things the way you've done things before.","You know, I don't think I had a concept of what I would be or do.","I'm normally drawn to something I haven't done and seen before.","I'm usually trying to react to what the actors are coming up with. And then the environment, and then the story.","I hadn't made a big-budget film, and in Hollywood there's a sort of man and boys situation. You're a man, you make $80 million movies! As if it's harder to make an $80 million movie. Well, I guess businesswise it is because you have more executives to argue with.","The media has gone through lots of things that make it a less foreign thing to have your lead character be gay.","Usually people just hire me.","I mean, I think I'm pretty sentimental.","I think that in some cases, I've made films that have a sentimental quality, at least as part of the film.","My family moved a lot as a kid. We started in Colorado, where I lived for five years. We moved to Chicago for two years, to San Francisco for one year, Connecticut for seven, Oregon for a couple years, and then I went to school.","When you get to be 23, 24 or 25, you start to freeze up and become an adult.","Yeah, I try to be really calm.","My art teacher in junior high was a very out gay man and a mentor to me.","I was originally a painter, and I made films sort of as an extension of that, and then I started to try to make dramatic films because the early films were experimental films.","If you put up posters around town for high-school kids, high-school kids will come. If you're casting politicians, you can't put up posters and have politicians come down.","Because I didn't have brothers, I was always interested in the kids down the street that had four brothers in their family, so I became one of them - but it was not my family.","I've always been attracted to temporary families.","The biopic also wasn't a form that I necessarily believed in, because you can never really get it right, you know? It's also a form that's very popular - the straight-ahead biopic.","There are all kinds of ways that people present their films, but that's kind of a good feeling, if you can make it seem like the characters are really there.","Usually when I read something, first of all I'm looking for the story and then when I reread it, I'm sort of checking every part of it to see if every scene is necessary.","Sometimes, the people who are helping you can drop the ball.","Everything's changing so fast that it's sometimes hard to keep up.","If it were up to the executives, they probably wouldn't have directors at all.","I had never had a positive leading character - somebody that wasn't an antihero, or who wasn't more of a guy that you're supposed to be on the side of.","I had wanted to do a comedy.","Even if you try to copy a film shot by shot, you still can't. It's still your own film.","Well, I want to do everything in sort of a documentary style, ever since I started in the '80s.","I've always been interested in how to present something that relates to our reality - which is not really... I don't even know if documentary itself does as good a job. It has its own problems in trying to get at the reality of the situation.","The things that inform student culture are created and controlled by the unseen culture, the sociological aspects of our climbing culture, our 'me' generation, our yuppie culture, our SUVs, or, you know, shopping culture, our war culture."],"Gustav Heinemann":["Insecurity and resignation mingle with the hope for a better order.","Therefore it does not help to sneer at the imperfection of today's reality or to preach absolutes as a daily agenda.","Liberal democracy must finally become the vital element of our society.","We have to recognize that the freedom of the individual has to be protected not only from the power of the state, but even more so from economic and societal power.","War is not the quintessential emergency in which man has to prove himself, as my generation learned at its school desks in the days of the Kaiser; rather, peace is the emergency in which we all have to prove ourselves.","Trust cannot be commanded; and yet it is also correct that the only one who earns trust is the one who is prepared to grant trust.","The time has come - and must come - for multilateral conversations about a secure peace in all of Europe.","The secret of big and revolutionary actions also consists in discovering the tiny step that is simultaneously a strategic step, insofar as it entails additional steps in the direction of a better reality.","The first thing I see is the obligation to serve peace.","Some fatherlands are difficult. Germany is one of them. But it is our fatherland. Here is where we live and work.","One of our most noble political tasks is to open up trust.","Not less, but more democracy - that is the demand, that is the great goal that we have to prescribe for ourselves, and especially for our youth.","Ladies and gentlemen, on the occasion of my election I received many letters from people representing all segments of the population and all professions, especially from the younger generation, linking my inauguration with great - far too great - expectations.","Ladies and gentlemen, I take office at a time in which the world is living in extreme contradictions.","I appeal to the responsibility of the blocs and the major powers, not to seek security in the arms race, but rather in a meeting for joint disarmament and arms limitations.","Everywhere, authority and tradition have to justify themselves in the face of questions.","Disarmament requires trust.","Beyond peace, there is no longer any existence possible."],"Gustav Klimt":["Whoever wants to know something about me - as an artist which alone is significant - they should look attentively at my pictures and there seek to recognise what I am and what I want.","I can paint and draw. I believe this myself and a few other people say that they believe this too. But I'm not certain of whether it's true.","There is no self-portrait of me.","After tea it's back to painting - a large poplar at dusk with a gathering storm. From time to time instead of this evening painting session I go bowling in one of the neighbouring villages, but not very often.","Although even when I am being idle I have plenty of food for thought both early and late - thoughts both about and not about art.","All art is erotic.","There is nothing that special to see when looking at me. I'm a painter who paints day in day out, from morning till evening - figure pictures and landscapes, more rarely portraits.","If the weather is good I go into the nearby wood - there I am painting a small beech forest (in the sun) with a few conifers mixed in. This takes until 8 'o clock.","True relaxation, which would do me the world of good, does not exist for me.","Sometimes I miss out the morning's painting session and instead study my Japanese books in the open.","On my first days here I did not start work immediately but, as planned, I took it easy for a few days - flicked through books, studied Japanese art a little.","Even when I have to write a simple letter I'm scared stiff as if faced with looming seasickness."],"Gustav Krupp":["Our thoughts fly therefore by themselves in this festive hour of our plant community, to the man whom we thank for the ressurection of our Nation: Adolf Hitler, the patron of German labour and German art.","May the spirit of devotion to duty which inspires us always dominate this Committee's conferences!","I could only speak in the smallest, most intimate circles about the real reasons which made me undertake the changeover of the plants for certain lines of production for I had to expect that many people would not understand me.","I knew German history well, and out of my experiences in the rest of the world I believed to know the German kind; therefore I never doubted that, although for the time being all indications were against it, one day a change would come.","No: war material is life-saving for one's own people and whoever works and performs in these spheres can be proud of it; here enterprise as a whole finds its highest justification of existence.","Through years of secret work, scientific and basic ground work was laid, in order to be ready again to work the German Armed Forces at the appointed hour, without loss of time or experience.","To have united the purposes of an entire Nation, is the great historical achievement of the man in whose strong hands our President has placed the fate of our people.","Unanimously we will confess and pledge ourselves to stand behind the Fuehrer and his movement today and forever and thereby to be of service to the idea of eternal Germany.","We are all proud of having thus contributed to the heretofore magnificent successes of our army.","We want only loyal workers who are grateful from the bottom of their hearts for the bread which we let them earn.","With these men and women who work-for the cause with all their hearts, with cool heads and skilled hands we will master every fate."],"Gustav Mahler":["The call of love sounds very hollow among these immobile rocks.","With the coming of spring, I am calm again.","A symphony must be like the world. It must contain everything.","Spring won't let me stay in this house any longer! I must get out and breathe the air deeply again.","It's not just a question of conquering a summit previously unknown, but of tracing, step by step, a new pathway to it.","When I have reached a summit, I leave it with great reluctance, unless it is to reach for another, higher one.","Fortunately, something always remains to be harvested. So let us not be idle.","Don't bother looking at the view - I have already composed it.","In its beginnings, music was merely chamber music, meant to be listened to in a small space by a small audience.","If you think you're boring your audience, go slower not faster.","You must renounce all superficiality, all convention, all vanity and delusion.","The point is not to take the world's opinion as a guiding star but to go one's way in life and working unerringly, neither depressed by failure nor seduced by applause.","Destiny smiles upon me but without making me the least bit happier.","All that is not perfect down to the smallest detail is doomed to perish.","I am thrice homeless, as a native of Bohemia in Austria, as an Austrian among Germans, and as a Jew throughout the world. Everywhere an intruder, never welcomed.","It should be one's sole endeavor to see everything afresh and create it anew.","Behind me the branches of a wasted and sterile existence are cracking.","Never let oneself be guided by the opinion of one's contemporaries. Continue steadfastly on one's way.","I don't let myself get carried away by my own ideas - I abandon 19 out of 20 of them every day.","The impressions of the spriritual experiences gave my future life its form and content.","I hope you will no longer accuse me of a lack of delicacy. as I now count on your understanding.","I live like a Hottentot. I cannot exchange one sensible word with anyone.","It is strange how one feels drawn forward without knowing at first where one is going.","The further the music develops, the more complex the apparatus used by the composer to express his thoughts becomes.","I was a crazy young man who let himself be blinded by his passions and obeyed only the impulses of the moment.","If a composer could say what he had to say in words he would not bother trying to say it in music.","Discipline, work. Work, discipline.","I beg of you... never assume an inner or an outer pose, never a disguise.","Melodic invention is one of the surest signs of a divine gift.","The real art of conducting consists in transitions.","There is a world of difference between a Mahler eighth note and a normal eighth note.","To judge a composer's work, one must consider it as a whole.","What I wanted and what I visualized while composing has not always been realized.","The longer you live and the more you learn, the more clearly you will feel the difference between the few men who are truly great and the mere virtuosi.","An operetta is simply a small and gay opera.","Beauty and fullness of tone can be achieved by having the whole orchestra play with high clarinets and a carefully selected number of piccolos.","Even if people censure me, they should do so hat in hand.","I also had a brother who was like me a musician and a composer. A man of great talent, far more gifted than I. He died very young... he killed himself in the prime of his life.","I am hitting my head against the walls, but the walls are giving way.","I have become a different person. I don't know whether this person is better, he certainly is not happier.","If I weren't the way I am, I shouldn't write my symphonies.","In the theatrical works we love and admire the most, the ending of the drama generally takes place offstage.","It is easier to achieve a desired result in short pieces.","The spirit can assert itself only through the medium of clear form."],"Gustav Stickley":["The quiet rhythmic monotone of the wall of logs fills one with the rustic peace of a secluded nook in the woods.","There are elements of intrinsic beauty in the simplification of a house built on the log cabin idea.","First, there is the bare beauty of the logs themselves with their long lines and firm curves. Then there is the open charm felt of the structural features which are not hidden under plaster and ornament, but are clearly revealed, a charm felt in Japanese architecture."],"Gustav Stresemann":["As a consequence of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, the officer corps of the old army became part of this class, as did that part of the younger generation who, in the old Germany, would have become officers or civil servants.","Just as a child respects his father even when he perceives his weaknesses and faults, so a German will not despise the old Germany which was once a symbol of greatness to him.","As a result of the World War, this old Germany collapsed. It collapsed in its constitution, in its social order, in its economic structure. Its thinking and feeling changed.","Historians still often see the end of the war as meaning nothing more for Germany than lost territories, lost participation in colonization, and lost assets for the state and individuals. They frequently overlook the most serious loss that Germany suffered.","If one seeks to analyze experiences and reactions to the first postwar years, I hope one may say without being accused of bias that it is easier for the victor than for the vanquished to advocate peace.","For the victor peace means the preservation of the position of power which he has secured. For the vanquished it means resigning himself to the position left to him.","In every man the memory of the struggles and the heroes of the past is alive. But these memories are not incompatible with the desire for peace in the future.","Just as the British subject loves England despite her faults, so we must insist that all Germans who were part of the old Germany and helped shape her, recognize the greatness and worthiness of present-day Germany.","Just as the child is father to the man, so the impressions of one's youth remain the most vivid in manhood.","Mankind advances only through struggle.","This old Germany was partly defeated in its conflict with the progressive ideas of socialism, for it had given the people nothing that could serve as a successful alternative to socialism.","To contrast national solidarity and international cooperation as two opposites seems foolish to me.","Voices were heard from the United States of America which made it clear that America wanted a peaceful and united Europe as a basis for mutual cooperation.","The concept of active cooperation has taken the place of opposition to the new form of government and of dreamy resignation entranced with the beauty of times past.","The great men of a nation reach out to all mankind. They are unifying, not divisive; internationally conciliating and still great nationally.","Here we encounter two conflicting concepts with which we must come to grips in our time: the idea of national solidarity and the idea of international cooperation.","Nothing is more misleading to the youth of a nation than to state the outcome immediately after the beginning as if nothing could have taken place in between.","A people that has experienced all that the Germans have been through, naturally offers fertile soil for the extremists.","A Shakespeare could have arisen only on English soil. In the same way, your great dramatists and poets express the nature and essence of the Norwegian people, but they also express that which is universally valid for all mankind.","As a confirmed individualist I certainly do not wish to underrate the influence of the individual, for the masses do not lead the individual; rather, in the individual is vested the capacity to lead the masses.","But just as haste and restlessness are typical of our present-day life, so change also takes place more rapidly than before. This applies to change in the relationships between nations as it does to change within an individual nation.","Dante can be understood only within the context of Italian thought, and Faust would be unthinkable if divorced from its German background; but both are part of our common cultural heritage.","During the past few years I have led a sometimes hard battle for German foreign policy.","History uses a unit of measure for time that is different from that of the lifespan of the individual, whereas man is only too ready to measure the evolution of history by his own yardstick.","I must begin by saying something about the old Germany. That Germany, too, suffered from superficial judgment, because appearances and reality were not always kept apart in people's minds.","No change in the balance of political parties can alter the general determination that no class should be excluded from contributing to and sharing responsibility for the state.","Nothing in the reporting of a nation's history could so mislead the younger generation as to represent great events in such a way that they appear to have happened as a matter of course.","The courtesy which most becomes a victor was denied to Germany for a long time.","The history of nations shows that words are not always immediately followed by action.","The life of the individual is a continuous combat with errors and obstacles, and no victory is more satisfying than the one achieved against opposition.","To walk behind others on a road you are traveling together, to give precedence to others without envy - this is painful for an individual and painful for a nation."],"Gustave Courbet":["Painting is the representation of visible forms. The essence of realism is its negation of the ideal.","Fine art is knowledge made visible.","The beautiful is in nature, and it is encountered under the most diverse forms of reality. Once it is found it belongs to art, or rather to the artist who discovers it.","When we see men of worth, we should think of equalling them; when we see men of a contrary character, we should turn inward and examine ourselves.","I hope to live all my life for my art, without abandoning my principles one iota.","Painting is an essentially concrete art and can only consist of the representation of real and existing things.","The expression of beauty is in direct ratio to the power of conception the artist has acquired.","France is the only nation in which astoundingly small numbers of civilized patrons reside.","I am not one who was born in the custody of wisdom; I am one who is fond of olden times and intense in quest of the sacred knowing of the ancients.","Beauty, like truth, is relative to the time when one lives and to the individual who can grasp it. The expression of beauty is in direct ratio to the power of conception the artist has acquired."],"Gustave Flaubert":["I believe that if one always looked at the skies, one would end up with wings.","The art of writing is the art of discovering what you believe.","To be stupid, selfish, and have good health are three requirements for happiness, though if stupidity is lacking, all is lost.","There is no truth. There is only perception.","Be regular and orderly in your life, so that you may be violent and original in your work.","One mustn't ask apple trees for oranges, France for sun, women for love, life for happiness.","Love is a springtime plant that perfumes everything with its hope, even the ruins to which it clings.","Poetry is as precise a thing as geometry.","Of all lies, art is the least untrue.","Judge the goodness of a book by the energy of the punches it has given you. I believe the greatest characteristic of genius, is, above all, force.","Exuberance is better than taste.","The most glorious moments in your life are not the so-called days of success, but rather those days when out of dejection and despair you feel rise in you a challenge to life, and the promise of future accomplishments.","Nothing is more humiliating than to see idiots succeed in enterprises we have failed in.","What an elder sees sitting; the young can't see standing.","The artist must be in his work as God is in creation, invisible and all-powerful; one must sense him everywhere but never see him.","One can be the master of what one does, but never of what one feels.","Our ignorance of history causes us to slander our own times.","The whole dream of democracy is to raise the proletarian to the level of stupidity attained by the bourgeois.","Oh, if I had been loved at the age of seventeen, what an idiot I would be today. Happiness is like smallpox: if you catch it too soon, it can completely ruin your constitution.","Do not read, as children do, to amuse yourself, or like the ambitious, for the purpose of instruction. No, read in order to live.","Anything becomes interesting if you look at it long enough.","It seems to me that I have always existed and that I possess memories that date back to the Pharaohs.","One mustn't look at the abyss, because there is at the bottom an inexpressible charm which attracts us.","As a rule we disbelieve all the facts and theories for which we have no use.","The better a work is, the more it attracts criticism; it is like the fleas who rush to jump on white linens.","Language is a cracked kettle on which we beat out tunes for bears to dance to, while all the time we long to move the stars to pity.","Stupidity is something unshakable; nothing attacks it without breaking itself against it; it is of the nature of granite, hard and resistant.","You can calculate the worth of a man by the number of his enemies, and the importance of a work of art by the harm that is spoken of it.","Life must be a constant education; one must learn everything, from speaking to dying.","The deplorable mania of doubt exhausts me. I doubt about everything, even my doubts.","The faster the word sticks to the thought, the more beautiful is the effect.","I love my work with a frenetic and perverse love, as an ascetic loves the hair shirt which scratches his belly.","Woman is a vulgar animal from whom man has created an excessively beautiful ideal.","The heart, like the stomach, wants a varied diet.","I am a man-pen. I feel through the pen, because of the pen.","One arrives at style only with atrocious effort, with fanatical and devoted stubbornness.","What is the beautiful, if not the impossible.","Human speech is like a cracked kettle on which we tap crude rhythms for bears to dance to, while we long to make music that will melt the stars.","Reality does not conform to the ideal, but confirms it.","One never tires of what is well written, style is life! It is the very blood of thought!","One must always hope when one is desperate, and doubt when one hopes.","A memory is a beautiful thing, it's almost a desire that you miss.","I have come to have the firm conviction that vanity is the basis of everything, and finally that what one calls conscience is only inner vanity.","One mustn't always believe that feeling is everything. In the arts, it is nothing without form.","Happiness is a monstrosity! Punished are those who seek it.","Success is a consequence and must not be a goal.","The cult of art gives pride; one never has too much of it.","Of all possible debauches, traveling is the greatest that I know; that's the one they invented when they got tired of all the others.","Everything one invents is true, you may be perfectly sure of that. Poetry is as precise as geometry.","I love good sense above all, perhaps because I have none.","The more humanity advances, the more it is degraded.","Here is true immorality: ignorance and stupidity; the devil is nothing but this. His name is Legion.","Read much, but not many books.","Artists who seek perfection in everything are those who cannot attain it in anything.","Read in order to live.","All one's inventions are true, you can be sure of that. Poetry is as exact a science as geometry.","Madame Bovary is myself.","The author, in his work, must be like God in the Universe, present everywhere and visible nowhere.","But the disparaging of those we love always alienates us from them to some extent. We must not touch our idols; the gilt comes off in our hands.","Writing is a dog's life, but the only life worth living.","There are neither good nor bad subjects. From the point of view of pure Art, you could almost establish it as an axiom that the subject is irrelevant, style itself being an absolute manner of seeing things.","A friend who dies, it's something of you who dies.","A superhuman will is needed in order to write, and I am only a man.","I have the handicap of being born with a special language to which I alone have the key.","I hate that which we have decided to call realism, even though I have been made one of its high priests.","Art requires neither complaisance nor politeness; nothing but faith, faith and freedom.","The true poet for me is a priest. As soon as he dons the cassock, he must leave his family.","Style is as much under the words as in the words. It is as much the soul as it is the flesh of a work.","The only way to avoid being unhappy is to close yourself up in Art and to count for nothing all the rest.","The future is the worst thing about the present.","Caught up in life, you see it badly. You suffer from it or enjoy it too much. The artist, in my opinion, is a monstrosity, something outside of nature."],"Gustave Meyrink":["Read the sacred writings of all the peoples on Earth. Through all of them runs, like a red thread, the hidden Science of attaining and maintaining wakefulness.","Man is firmly convinced that he is awake; in reality he is caught in a net of sleep and dreams which he has unconsciously woven himself.","The secret is to be awake. To be awake is everything.","This goal can and must be attained in this life. But even if this does not happen, remember that he who has found the way once, always returns to this world with an internal maturity that enables him to continue his work.","To be awake is everything."],"Gustave Moreau":["I am dominated by one thing, an irresistible, burning attraction towards the abstract.","No one could have less faith in the absolute and definitive importance of the work created by man, because I believe that this world is nothing but a dream.","This bored fantastic woman, with her animal nature, giving herself the pleasure of seeing her enemy struck down, not a particularly keen one for her because she is so weary of having all her desires satisfied.","When I want to render these fine nuances, I do not find them in the subject, but in the nature of women in real life who seek unhealthy emotions and are too stupid even to understand the horror in the most appalling situations."],"Gustavo Dudamel":["With an orchestra you are building citizens, better citizens for the community.","It's not that people don't like classical music. It's that they don't have the chance to understand and to experience it.","When people feel that something really special is happening on the stage, things change.","Classical music in Venezuela is now something like a pop concert. You can see people screaming or crying because they don't have a ticket.","I think it's a very important collaboration between the conductor and the orchestra - especially when the conductor is one more member of the orchestra in the way that you are leading, but also respecting, feeling and building the same way for all the players to understand the music.","You learn a lot about each other from a tour, musically and humanly.","I think the atmosphere of a Prom concert can change your life, in the best way. It's so deep, the feeling you have there. The audience is so close, and there are so many of them, that you feel they are almost embracing you.","Going to a concert can sometimes be very difficult. It can be a long journey. There's the ticket prices. But when the music goes to the community - not the community coming to the concert - they say, 'Wow! I didn't know that this music was so amazing!'","We have to go and show these people what classical music is. We say sometimes that classical music has a small audience, but it's because people don't have the chance to be closer to it.","Of course, we also have to play in concert halls. This is our dream when you are a musician - to play in a good, comfortable hall with a wonderful acoustic.","I think that I need to learn a lot, a lot.","In my imagination yes, I remember, when I was six years old, I was conducting all this concert in my house. But now it's real.","I wanted to play my violin and have my musical expression through the instrument. But then I was really young when I had my first opportunity to conduct.","My relationship with the Philharmonia Orchestra brought me many times to London and I will always reflect positively on that early period of development with them - their patience, their warmth, their dedication.","Recently, I went to a disco with friends, and all the young people were saying, 'Dudamel, we want to go to your concert, but it's impossible because it's sold out.' It's really amazing.","For me, Venezuela is very important, not just because it's a place I go to conduct, but because my family is there - my wife, my parents and my musical family.","People say that having three orchestras is a crazy life, but it's better because you have three families. I want to have my own kids very soon. In future, I still want to conduct a lot, but less, to be with my family.","I live day by day.","I have eaten very well in Los Angeles. Marvelously!","Los Angeles is a very special city. It's a great ethnic mix, a great cultural mix.","It's a small city where I have a lot of time to think. The orchestra and I have had a chance to connect very well in this time. I think of all the millions of people in Los Angles. There aren't that many millions of people in all of Sweden.","A friend gave me a CD of the 'Pathetique' Symphony as a Christmas present. I went home, and I put on the CD expecting to listen to Tchaikovsky. But it started 'ta ta ta taaa.' It was too long for me. I didn't understand it at first, but then I fell in love, in love, in love.","For me to rehearse with a children's orchestra a Mahler symphony was to really work. We had three or four weeks of rehearsal with the orchestra, every day eight or nine hours, putting the First together. I had been conducting Tchaikovsky a lot and Beethoven, but Mahler was different.","I love to read different books on completely different subjects at the same time. I cannot focus on one. I read a few pages of literature, then I jump to philosophy and at the same time I'm reading biographies of Mahler.","It's a physical challenge. It's a spiritual challenge. I'm studying almost every day a different symphony, not returning to any one for a week.","I set out to create a means whereby music could be a way of vindicating the rights of the masses.","I want to work with the big orchestras. I want to have a big family.","I love to travel, but sometimes it's nice to stay in one place.","You have to believe that things will happen, you have to work and love what you're doing.","Whenever I listen to a children's orchestra, I learn. They feel everything, they enjoy everything, they have amazing energy.","My material life is simple."],"Gustavo Santaolalla":["It's a deliberate choice. I am a fervent supporter of the idea that you don't have to have wall-to-wall music in good films.","I think my mom always wanted to play the guitar, and somehow she projected that to me. So I started learning to play guitar when I was five years old, but actually I'd never managed to get the academic side of it. So even up to today, I don't know how to read or write music.","The fact that I do so many things, it really nurtures me.","With bad movies, I have this image in my head of the director and the editor in the editing room watching a scene that is not happening, looking at each other and saying, 'Put some music in there.'","My parents were very musical in the sense that they were, you know, music lovers and avid buyers of records, but none of them actually play an instrument.","I grew up listening to everything. You know, from Argentinean folk music, tango, jazz, rock, just everything.","In the film work, I love to work mainly from the script and from talking to the directors, so a lot of the music, big portions of the scores that I've made, have been composed before the movies were even shot.","Film is something I've always loved since I was very young. In fact, I actually wanted to study to be a filmmaker when I was younger.","I love to get involved with projects that take me out of my comfort zone. I try to do things that are not necessarily what I'm used to. I always wanted to do a big animation movie and stick to the codes that this genre sometimes implies.","One of the things that was a blessing for me is my parents were music lovers. Neither of my parents played an instrument, but they were avid record buyers. And I grew up at every age listening to all kinds of music.","My first band was an Argentinian folk group when I was 10. When I was 12 I had my electric guitar, and by the time I was 13, the Beatles came into the scene, and that was over. So I have a mixture of all these traditions, and I think that's who I am, a mixture of everything.","I have a very strong identity that connects me to Argentina and to Latin America, but at the same time, I have a deep connection to the music from the United States and music from Europe, too.","I love playing instruments that I don't know how to play or am not familiar with. I like the idea of danger and innocence that comes from it. As an artist, I feel I should be able to do something with anything I get my hands on. The music becomes minimalist because of my limited knowledge."],"Guy Berryman":["I'm never happier than when I'm being creative, whether that's with Coldplay or other artists. I just love being in the studio.","Just keep it simple. When you over-think what you're wearing, that's when wardrobe malfunctions tend to happen.","At school, there was an annual school disco and I'd be standing in my bedroom wondering what to wear for hours on end. Eventually I'd arrive at a decision that was just the most ridiculous costume you could have ever devised - I think it was probably knitted Christmas jumpers on top of buttoned-up white shirts.","I only shoot on film. I like the quality, the grain and the imperfections. It offers me something much more rewarding than any digital camera can give me. I believe the extra expense is worth it.","Magne Furuholmen is a very dear friend of mine. A-ha are a classic pop band and they've got some brilliant songs. I'd say 'The Living Daylights' was one of my favourite Bond tunes: regardless of it being a Bond song, it stands alone as a great piece of music.","I don't concentrate on technical things like where a microphone is placed and things like that. As a producer, I try to keep the initial feeling from when I first heard a song and make sure we do what were initially aiming for."],"Guy Clark":["It's just something I've always done. In South Texas, the first guitar you get is a Mexican guitar. And the first one I got, the first thing I did was take it apart.","Things change all the time, and they'll probably never be the same again. It's just the natural evolution of the human condition. Things change, and whatever it is is what it is. I mean, you try to start second guessing that, you either get rich or die broke.","Chris is the engineer down at the studio where we do these things. And he's just such an integral part and he has such a marvelous ear. Also it turns out, we didn't know, but he's a pretty good fiddle player.","Ain't no chance if you don't take it.","All gut strings. That's just the first kind of guitar I played, it was a nylon string guitar. And to me, it's the purest form of guitar making, and I just enjoy doing it.","But by the time you get there and you get home, it winds up being a lot of time out. So I'm getting the itch to build, I know that. I keep looking at my stacks of wood and what I can do with it.","Darrell is really good in the studio. I mean, he has a real working knowledge of how the process works, and what sounds good coming back over tape, and how the stuff works together.","I don't know what the outcome will be. I put a couple away for my grandkids, like that. So I don't know, who knows? Maybe I'll start building guitars for a living.","I get pretty much all the exercise I need walking down airport concourses carrying bags.","I have no reason to sit home and write songs all day without going out and playing for the folks. And I have no reason to go play for the folks unless I'm writing new songs so they can sort of feed off one another. And I just try to do the best I can.","I just was apologizing for maybe being a little goofy.","I've known Shawn for several years. And he's just an amazing talent. He's a great writer, a marvelous, marvelous guitar player, and plays really good fiddle.","It was really amazing. I mean, he'd never mentioned that he played in the symphony, like serious violin playing, not fiddle playing. And he just blew us away.","Mary Gauthier's great. Yeah, we've played a lot of gigs together. She's really wonderful.","There aren't any rules, as far as anything-and that applies especially to writing songs, whatever gets the point across. So you're just kind of brought up to feel-in any field, if you say you can do it, do it. There it is.","Well, I had a fiddle that I really can't play, so I loaned it to Darrell. But yeah, he's from another planet."],"Guy Davenport":["The difference between the Parthenon and the World Trade Center, between a French wine glass and a German beer mug, between Bach and John Philip Sousa, between Sophocles and Shakespeare, between a bicycle and a horse, though explicable by historical moment, necessity, and destiny, is before all a difference of imagination.","I was thought to be retarded as a child, and all the evidence indicates that I was.","Fiction's essential activity is to imagine how others feel, what a Saturday afternoon in an Italian town in the 2nd Century looked like. My ambition is solely to get some effect, as of light on stone in a forest on a September day.","I like to believe that I don't think of myself as a writer. I am an amateur. Back when I was teaching, I wrote when I could. Weekends were good typewriter time. Now, it's whenever I feel there's something to be put on paper. I don't care what time it is, though I always write in the notebooks at night.","As long as you have ideas, you can keep going. That's why writing fiction is so much fun: because you're moving people about, and making settings for them to move in, so there's always something there to keep working on.","There's nothing like being a soldier for confidence or learning your limits or enduring utter humiliation.","My view, as one who taught it, is that the whole purpose of a literary education should be to tell people that these things exist. I don't think any teacher should try to 'teach an author,' but rather simply describe what the author has written. And this is what I tried to do.","I never intended to be a teacher. I just like going to school and learning things.","The real use of imaginative reading is precisely to suspend one's mind in the workings of another sensibility.","Unless the work of art has wholly exhausted its maker's attention, it fails. This is why works of great significance are demanding and why they are infinitely rewarding.","Imagination is like the drunk man who lost his watch and must get drunk again to find it.","I am not writing for scholars or fellow critics, but for people who like to read, to look at pictures, and to know things.","Art knows neither doctrine nor idea; its nature is to show.","Poetry and fiction have grieved for a century now over the loss of some vitality which they think they see in a past from which we are by now irrevocably alienated."],"Guy Debord":["Behind the masks of total choice, different forms of the same alienation confront each other.","Ideas improve. The meaning of words participates in the improvement. Plagiarism is necessary. Progress implies it. It embraces an author's phrase, makes use of his expressions, erases a false idea, and replaces it with the right idea.","Quotations are useful in periods of ignorance or obscurantist beliefs.","Tourism, human circulation considered as consumption is fundamentally nothing more than the leisure of going to see what has become banal.","All that was once directly lived has become mere representation.","There is nothing more natural than to consider everything as starting from oneself, chosen as the center of the world; one finds oneself thus capable of condemning the world without even wanting to hear its deceitful chatter.","Young people everywhere have been allowed to choose between love and a garbage disposal unit. Everywhere they have chosen the garbage disposal unit.","Boredom is always counter-revolutionary. Always.","In societies where modern conditions of production prevail, all of life presents itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles. Everything that was directly lived has moved away into a representation.","As specialists of apparent life, stars serve as superficial objects that people can identify with in order to compensate for the fragmented productive specialisations that they actually live."],"Guy Fieri":["Cooking is all about people. Food is maybe the only universal thing that really has the power to bring everyone together. No matter what culture, everywhere around the world, people get together to eat.","Food is not just eating energy. It's an experience.","There are two different things: there's grilling, and there's barbecue. Grilling is when people say, 'We're going to turn up the heat, make it really hot and sear a steak, sear a burger, cook a chicken.' Barbecue is going low and slow.","Manage the heat, let the meat cook, and you'll get fantastic results.","Cooking with kids is not just about ingredients, recipes, and cooking. It's about harnessing imagination, empowerment, and creativity.","You can find tranquility, you can find party, you can find new friends. I'm a cruise convert.","You have to be confident in who you are and what you're doing. Of course, you try to evolve. I would never tell you, 'Today is the best I will ever be.' I'm always trying to be a better chef, a better dad, a better person.","Cooking is like snow skiing: If you don't fall at least 10 times, then you're not skiing hard enough.","In Japanese, sushi does not mean raw fish. It means seasoned rice.","I'm a culinary gangsta with a very spiritual side, so when I was introduced to the 'spiritual gangster' line, I had to have it.","There's nothing that can replicate the smoky flavor of char, so when I've got the hankering for it, I tell my wife that I'm taking care of dinner. I have three different types of barbecues - a coal, gas and smoker - so I can experiment a lot.","My sister and I cooked a lot together; my sister was a very healthy vegetarian. She was always a real good teacher for me about organics, recycling, composting -whenever you hear me talk about it, it's usually because of my sister's influence.","If I probably didn't have tattoos, or if I probably didn't bleach my hair, or if I probably didn't wear blue jeans and a T-shirt to fancy things, if I didn't do things that make me look like someone who's whacked out of their mind, it'd probably be different. But then again, that's how I wanna dress.","At first, people think about vegetarian food like, 'Here's some veggies. Here's some pasta.' But there's so much more you can do in the vegetarian and vegan world.","I don't drink soda.","Your classic guacamole is just avocados, lime juice, and salt.","Look, the fame rocket is only on the upward trajectory for a limited time.","When I was 12, we began hosting exchange students from Norway, Sweden, Japan and Spain. I soon realized there was a whole world out there. I was determined to spend my sophomore year in high school abroad. My school taught only Spanish, but I wanted to go to France, and I did.","No matter how tough the meat may be, it's going to be tender if you slice it thin enough.","I would ride my horse to school.","I don't eat sweets. I'm not a big dessert guy.","The wok is one of my favorite things to work with when I'm camping. Outdoor cooking is not just about hot dogs and hamburgers. There are so many styles of food you can make.","If you are AC/DC, you don't get credit for slow songs. And if you are doing a show about food with a blond dude with crazy blond hair and tattoos who drives a hot rod, of course everyone is going to think everything you eat is deep-fried.","The opportunity to be a star chef, to imagine it would be here in Las Vegas, I couldn't comprehend it.","There are three people you need in life: an accountant, a fishmonger, and a bail bondsman.","People get a little bolder and more wild in summer. You've got things going on kabobs, things cooking on the bone. There's something about standing over a grill or outside with the family that inspires us.","If it tastes really good, and it's funky, it's funkalicous. If the guy making it is funky, he's funkintacious.","I'm not a celebrity chef. I'm a chef that happens to have television shows and a chef that happens to do media.","If you're feeling adventurous, grill up some marinated octopus. It's so healthy.","I tell anyone who will listen to me: On a cruise, you can be with all these people, or you can be by yourself. You can find tranquility, you can find party, you can find new friends. I'm a cruise convert.","I wake up in the morning thinking about food.","I was always a kid trying to make a buck. I borrowed a dollar from my dad, went to the penny candy store, bought a dollar's worth of candy, set up my booth, and sold candy for five cents apiece. Ate half my inventory, made $2.50, gave my dad back his dollar.","I did a big thing with Ritz Crackers - great cracker. Am I now the Ritz chef? No! Do I think the cracker has a lot of diversity and appeal? Yeah! Does it mean that's my foundation of cooking? No!","Kids want to saute, to cut the pizza, to see how the ingredients come together. If you let them do the fun stuff, they'll develop skills and interests that will stay with them forever.","One of the greatest birds I've ever had is called a 'Turducken.' A chicken inside of a duck inside of a turkey. That's one that I love. I've done it a couple times.","I am just a regular dude who happened to make it. That's all I am, man. Maybe I was preparing myself in some lifetime to become this person, but I never thought I'd have every rocket shooting off at one time.","You don't have to eat a whole cheeseburger, just take a piece of the cheeseburger.","If you looked in my fridge, you'd see maybe 12 different mustards.","What do people want? Contact. People want to be able to see you and touch you. Are you real?","If you're cooking and not making mistakes, you're not playing outside your safety zone. I don't expect it all to be good. I have fat dogs because I scrap that stuff out the back door.","I'm gonna open a small restaurant on the beach in Mexico. We're only gonna have a few tables, and we're only gonna cook what's fresh that day. We're gonna get back to the basics.","Anybody that pays attention to hate really is wasting their time. I don't subscribe. I don't buy in.","It's football all day on Sunday. I wish we had football every day; that would make me way happier. Why can't we have that? You've got all these teams! Why can't we just play a Monday game, a Tuesday game, a Wednesday game?","With messy food, or foods with a lot of sauce, you do 'The Hunch.' I learned it in Philly, watching the dudes in suits eat cheesesteaks. You keep your elbows above your hands because if you don't, the grease runs down your sleeve to your elbow.","There's been quite a few conversations between me and my wife; she'd like to see my hair brown again. So who knows what will happen.","I'm not doing anything for anybody. I'm doing what I do.","I'm a big greens fan. I'm a big vegetable fan. I'm a big whole grains fan. And I exercise a lot. That's how I keep this petite dancer's figure.","I am the worst at the grocery store. It turns into three carts. It turns into, 'Oh did you see the truffle cheese? We've got to get the truffle cheese!'","When I was 13, I opened my own business called The Awesome Pretzel Company, and my dad helped me build a pretzel cart.","People need to take a little bit more risk.","The wok is one of my favorite things to work with when I'm camping.","I'm a collector, so I've got all kinds of sunglasses. I'd say I've got about a buck ten, buck twenty.","I have a fond appreciation for the Canadian culture and the Canadian food scene in general.","I specifically left the corporate world so I could wear T-shirts, blue jeans, and honestly, I always wanted to be my own boss.","I love everything from Enya to Pantera.","Kids love food. It's about putting materials out there that get kids thinking about food - to get kids interacting about food. It's about simple things, like kids thinking about pasta - getting kids to work with food.","I'm a stocky 210 pounds.","Short of screaming-hot Thai food, everything can be suitable for kids too.","I'm a big fan of doing 'Triple D.' But I don't want to do it forever, don't get me wrong! Travel away from my family, are you crazy? But do you know what it does for these mom-and-pop restaurant joints? It changes their lives forever. I mean, their businesses will never be the same.","I eat healthier than you think. I eat grains and vegetables when I'm home - and I eat in courses. My wife, Lori, thinks it's because I don't want foods to touch. That's not it. If you eat courses, you slow down your meal and eat less. It's a trick I picked up in France as a kid.","Everybody has their role in the food world and what they choose to appreciate. I'm not a fine dining chef. I appreciate it. I think Thomas Keller is amazing. But I really like where I'm at; I like what I do. I like how it makes people feel.","I once saw professional soccer up there in Seattle, the Sounders. I went and saw that. I'm not a big soccer fan, but watching a live game is unbelievable. And then I went to Italy and saw a soccer match; it's something everyone should do once. It'll blow your mind.","The last thing I'm gonna do is, 'This is dynamite!' That's not my gig, man. I love the mom-and-pop joints. I love giving them recognition, but I'm not gonna blow smoke. We walked out of locations; we've changed locations.","I've always been an eccentric, a rocker at heart. I can't play the guitar, but I can play the griddle.","Ripe avocados should be soft, not squishy, and you should be able to flick the little stem off easily.","Avocados that haven't fully ripened will lack the big flavor you want for your dip.","I've never been an apron fan; it's all too cumbersome to me.","I really believe you've gotta put the power in the people. They're the ones who are gonna make the experience.","I'm like anybody else. You get enough, you can get beat up. You can get hurt. You can get frustrated. You can get demoralized.","A lot of people who like sushi don't really like raw fish or seaweed.","Howie Mandel is the real deal.","I always tell my family - and they laugh about it - but someday, I will write a vegetarian book. My cousin, who's a big vegetarian, tells me flat out, 'You're my favorite vegetarian chef.'","It's always good to go over the recipe beforehand, so you can easily think of the next thing that needs to be done.","Preparing food is one of life's great joys, but a lot of times, parents ask their kids if they want to cook with them and then tell them to go peel a bag of potatoes. That's not cooking - that's working!","I take everything very seriously, but I also take it lighthearted to recognize that you can't control it.","We are not blessed with junk food - my family and my kids do not eat fast foods.","I'm a big hiker, and I like boxing. I mean, I love a good burger, but I keep things in moderation.","There are races and then there are races. And without a doubt, the Indy 500 is the race that I've always wanted to attend. And now, to be driving the Corvette Pace Car... this is going to be unbelievable.","I'm a five-seasons griller! Did you know I added a new season? Living in Cali, I'm cooking in the yard all the time. I don't care what the weather is like. My hair is impervious to any kind of dampness, so I don't have too much to worry about.","Some people are just born to cook and talk.","I think anyone that grew up in the '70s and '80s grew up with Bob Barker and Wink Martindale and I think that was just always... when you were a game show host, you were the man of the hour.","My restaurant, Tex Wasabi's, we have a whole 'Minute to Win It' challenge going on on Sundays already. The show hasn't even aired and they're already doing challenges where people are coming and participating. I think it's going to take over.","If you slow it down, eat in courses, your body, mind, stomach will catch up with this full feeling and you won't eat as much.","Liver is my number one most hated food. Oh, God, I get sick talking about it!","I don't know what singers feel like when they make a song and people clap along and love it, but when people walk up to me and say the food was outstanding, that's what it is all about. I cook because I like to make people happy.","My stay-married secret would probably be exercising good communication, not when you have to but all the time. I think if you do that, you kinda just cleanse the situations, so there's not build up. I think that's probably the best way to do it.","Losing my sister to cancer was... That was the worst thing in the world, man.","What you see is what you get with me. There's no show.","I'm not a greasy food guy. I don't eat like that.","I can't bake anything. I'm the worst. My cakes always come out flat.","My parents were all into macrobiotic cooking and natural cooking, and my sister was a vegetarian. I wasn't down with that.","I love 'Iron Chef' and I love 'Chopped.' I watch both of them. I think it is crazy what those chefs go through.","Get off the beaten path... If you want to find those mom-and-pop joints, those funky little places, just ask around.","If you've really got a problem with me, and you came and told me you had a problem with me, I'd be interested to listen to you. But if you're just some loser that sits there and hammers away on some blog form or whatever, I don't have time for that. Why even worry about it?","I was raised with hippie parents, so I get down with the positive. I don't pay attention to the negative.","Growing up in Northern California, I've only seen snow at Christmas maybe twice in my life! I was always jealous of my cousins on the East Coast with their white Christmases.","My parents moved out to California in 1968 from Ohio in a VW station wagon pulling a little trailer. I was 4 months old. They were following the energy out here.","My spiked hair goes back about 15 years ago. I had long, curly rocker hair then. The woman who cuts my hair thought I needed a new style, so I let her surprise me. I flipped when I first saw it, but I soon realized the look was really me. I've always been a little crazy.","I have my own boat, but when I first thought about taking a cruise, I thought, 'You're going to trap me on a boat, and I'm going to walk in circles and go crazy,' but it's awesome.","I love to exercise. I'm a big hiker, and I like boxing. I mean, I love a good burger, but I keep things in moderation.","After a show, people say, 'I bet you want to just sit back and relax.' No way. First thing I want to do when I'm home is cook.","I love to cook for people. It's my honor, honestly. It's what I have to give.","I say to folks all the time, 'Watch what you're eating. You don't have to eat it all. Make conscious choices. It doesn't mean you have to starve yourself and eat carrots all day.' Have an awareness.","We're getting ready to sit down at the table and have Thanksgiving, and there's people that are not with their families. There are people that are in dangerous areas, putting their lives on the line to keep our country free, and I think that's something we should all celebrate every day.","I'm not an actor. Lord knows, I'd be acting if I were an actor. What you see is what you get.","I've been using the same hair wax for as long as I can remember. I'm not a gel guy, I'm not a perfume guy, not really into any of that.","I have three wood-fired ovens... I have one at my house, one at my ranch, one on the trailer that I use for charity events.","Triple D is all about three things: Food, story and character.","I need to stay disciplined on the road. Too much food can wreck your palate.","I respect anybody that cooks. I know how hard it is.","When someone is dying, there is nothing you really can do, it's a horrible situation, and... you just have to get through it.","I was raised not so much in a puritan environment, but for the most part, a pretty healthy one.","My first words were always about food - I grew up in northern California, and when I was 10 years old, I had my own pretzel cart business.","I never knew I would go this far, but I was told by people it wouldn't happen, and now I own four restaurants, and I have one of the best shows on the Food Network. I'm living in the Super Bowl of food.","The Tom Brady sandwich would be a prosciutto with a nice Buffalo mozzarella, on a crispy baguette with a little fresh basil. Brady is classy; he's a really cool dude. He's got a lot of flavor.","No one likes rubbery chicken.","Nothing, not even an avocado pit, keeps guacamole green for too long once it's made.","It's OK to make mistakes... Try different things.","I look at a basketball laying on the ground, and it makes me think of something. Popcorn ball. How 'bout a spicy popcorn ball? That is how my mind is always working.","I get influence from everybody and everything.","Food is a common denominator for all people.","It's a life lesson they need to have, a skill everybody needs - to cook.","College students want good eats. They want it to not be super-expensive, but you've got to be eclectic, you've got to have style, and you've got to make real food.","Contrary to popular belief, I eat all types of food. Fried food is my least favorite.","I have the best agents in the world.","'Triple D' is not going anywhere. I enjoy highlighting my brothers and sisters in the business.","I never try and do the same show, ever. The audience controls the dynamic of the shows. Sometimes they listen, and sometimes they ask a million questions.","Outdoor cooking is not just about hot dogs and hamburgers. There are so many styles of food you can make.","I'm in a very unique position in that I got to participate in the Food Network by contest. That's long gone, being voted on, but I don't forget where it came from, and I don't forget the people who worked to put me here.","The No. 1 thing I hear from people when I meet them in the airport is, 'Oh my gosh, you're just like you are on TV.' Well, I'm not an actor. I don't think anyone could figure out how to be this weird.","I'm a big eater in terms that l love flavor, but I don't like to eat a lot of one thing. I like to eat a little bit.","I'm a huge kale fan.","Did I ever think about TV stardom? I don't watch a lot of TV. I wasn't even aware of the phenomenon of what was going on in food television, what you started with the Food Network.","I love that UNLV is a big-little school, that you can still have access and support as a student.","I always wish for more time at home or at the restaurants or on the shows.","I'm a chef, I own restaurants, and there's a behavior in the kitchen you have to have.","Why can't we have a concert with food? Your typical cooking demonstration, there's just no enthusiasm. There's no energy behind it. I said, 'What if we take a cooking demonstration and fortify it with a lot of good music? ... Drive it to the next level?'","I definitely eat in moderation and exercise.","I think there's a misconception that I eat everything. The one or two bites that you see me take, that's it.","When you love the competition, the opportunity to achieve at simple but challenging games, some people are really into it, and I'm one of them.","Whenever you get to change somebody's life or watch it and see it happen, it's amazing.","I try to hike at least three times a week when I'm home in Sonoma County.","I was even more of a Hagar fan when he was just Hagar and not Van Hagar.","I wanted to work in corporate restaurants.","It's tough, you know: I'm a chef first, and a restaurant owner, way before I was ever on Food Network, and it's a tough business.","I cannot get enough farro.","I'm gonna open a small restaurant on the beach in Mexico. We're only gonna have a few tables, and we're only gonna cook what's fresh that day. We're gonna get back to the basics... Real food for real people.","People are very phobic about fish. And if they do cook fish, they fry it, which kills all the flavor.","The men and women in the Armed Forces, that's what I always think about and what I teach my kids about. We're getting ready to sit down at the table and have Thanksgiving, and there's people that are not with their families.","One of my good buddies is Marcel Reece with the Raiders. He's a big 'Triple-D' fan; he's a big food fan.","One of my good buddies is Steve Hutchinson. He used to play for the Vikings, and he's also been on 'Triple-D.'","As soon as you wanna take away the flavor of anything, just fry it.","I'm not a religious person by any means."],"Guy Finley":["Being fully present is the best guarantee for a bright future.","Once something has outlived its usefulness in one area of life, its purpose for being in existence is no longer the same. The leaf that captures a stream of sunlight, and then transfers its energy to the tree, serves one purpose in the spring and summer, and another completely different one through the fall and winter.","Nothing in the universe can stop you from letting go and starting over.","Every relationship that we have in our lives - our contact with each person, place, and event - serves a very special, if yet to be realized purpose: They are mirrors that can serve to show us things about ourselves that can be realized in no other way.","Be still; quietly remember the presence of and within yourself, and you will know, without thinking, that while all around you everything changes, within you lives something unchanging.","Don't believe what the spiritual sharks and clever carnival hustlers tell you about fearless living - they lie.","The strength of any weakness within us is the degree to which it is feared.","To know that every moment - regardless of how it comes wrapped - is a gift greater than you can give yourself, is to be well on your way to a life without fear.","Statistics vary, but in less than seven years there won't be a single cell left in any of our bodies that's the same as it is today. This means that any human being who 'wants' to change is like a mountain river wanting to reach the valley floor. It's a done deal; that's what mountain rivers do, and 'changing' should be our first nature.","Real change isn't found in some new way to think about yourself, but in freedom from the need to think about yourself at all.","Every truth ever discovered, each new spiritual light that will ever burn bright has already been seeded in our consciousness.","Eventually, we reach the point where we start to realize that we are not going to find peace, contentment, happiness, strength, fearlessness - all of the things that in our heart of hearts we wish we had - outside of us.","The limit of your present understanding is not the limit of your possibilities.","What is the nature of that place where our original self is one with its longing to explore its own deepest possibilities, and where discovering the treasures waiting there is the same as fulfilling our purpose for being?","The mistake we have made in our lives is that over and over again we've run into the needful moment and then failed to learn its higher lesson. We don't like needful moments and therefore we resist them.","All created forms are fractal, as is their purpose, use, and allotted time for existence.","When it comes to the fearless life, the divine gives nothing freely... save to those who freely give themselves to discovering the truth about their own fearless selves.","Resistance to revelation, resistance to becoming conscious of all that dwells within us - high and low, light and dark - is the anti-change factor. It is also the mainspring of all our psychological fears.","Within each of us dwells a higher order of consciousness created with a possibility far greater than to merely appear and disappear as some form in the river of passing time.","Within the human being there exists both the needful and the needed. You know that the needful exists in you. Your own dissatisfaction tells you so. But you believe the needed is somewhere outside of you.","We need to see, and agree that what we seek already lives within us, and we within it. Now we know our one great task: watch for whatever promises us freedom, and then quietly, consciously refuse to see ourselves through the eyes of what we know is incomplete. Then we live wholeness itself, instead of spending our lives looking for it.","It only seems that there is something more important for you to do than to just quietly be yourself.","All things good come to those for whom the Good is all things.","It isn't something of which most of us are aware, but we human beings are 'marked' with a certain strange feature, and that is: We want to change.","In these times - where social appearance is more important than spiritual substance - what has become our longing to change is really the unconscious desire to control not just the shape of our bodies (according to prevailing values) but to dominate our environment as well, regardless of the cost.","The path to the inwardly enriched life is not hidden from the man or woman who longs to walk upon it.","It's important for us to become aware of the fact that we are needful, for with that awareness also comes the sensing that we couldn't be needful if there weren't something to fulfill the need.","The deepest parts of you know that if freedom from fear was as easy as 'creating a new reality' for yourself, then you would already be the fearless person you know in your heart that you're meant to be.","We go through our lives in a continual dance of being filled with something that needs an answer, and then going out and finding that answer... only to find out that our answer wasn't quite the answer.","If we're interested in spiritual things, we gradually realize that what we really need is to understand this nature that seems to be a bottomless basket, because there is no peace in it.","Within us - the heart of us, really - is a 'ground' that is to our thoughts and feelings, our relationships with others and ourselves, as is the Earth to the leaves that first race across her and then, no longer able to run, give themselves up to nourish her body so that she may give birth again come the spring.","All we will ever know and share about love, humility, compassion, and sacrifice - the secrets that will reveal and then resolve old sorrows - awaits us within ourselves.","What world is there for us where our essential nature - and its right to live free - is one and the same?"],"Guy Forget":["Anything is possible as long as you have the passion.","It's better to have done because then you know what the player is going through and you understand the pressure, but then on the other hand I know a lot of people that were good players but not good coaches, and vice versa.","I had a coach that was not a great player, but he taught with kids and juniors so that by the time he was 50 he was great. He helped me make the top 5 in the world and yet he wasn't a great player himself.","It's a tough world out there and all the guys are fighting hard and the competition is really tough.","When you are very little tennis should be fun, it should be a game.","You should just enjoy it, but as soon as you decide that it is going to be your career, no matter whether you want to be a doctor or an architect or anything else, you need to work 5 hours a day.","To be a professional tennis player you need to put in these sort of hours.","You can be a little lonely because it's an individual sport.","When you are a professional sportsman all the guys are great competitors in the top 50.","There are some guys you have problems beating because of their style - I always had difficulties with guys like Michael Chang and Andre Agassi because their returns were so good and they played so well in defence.","More than specific memories of achievements, for me I remember the feeling you get when you were just at your very best - when you felt like you were floating across the court and could put the ball wherever you wanted.","I retired because I had a knee injury, my cartilage was wearing out, it was painful and I couldn't put in the four hours of practice each day that I needed to.","But I still serve pretty big and that's one of my biggest weapons, so if my shoulder holds up and I can count on it, I can win a few matches and then you never know how the other guys are going to react to the fatigue and the length of the matches.","If you win, fine, if you don't, you try again next year.","I think our strength is this strong relationship we have all together.","When we want to reach a dream for the second time, you want it to come true, when you try so hard, you are so close to achieving it, it makes things very difficult to live with afterwards.","I think each player and myself live things differently because I have no physical effort to make.","If you lived the doubles, as I did, which was very stressful, you are sitting down in a chair experiencing a match without being able to hold a racquet in your hands.","Suddenly in the end when it's over, you feel a big weight on your shoulders. That's the role of the captain. Unfortunately, it's sometimes like that in sport."],"Guy Gavriel Kay":["We are all shaped by where we grow up, though that shaping takes different forms. I don't think there's any doubt that coming of age in Winnipeg both opened my eyes and made me hungry - if I can subvert all claims to be a real writer by mixing metaphors like that.","I never talk about books in progress. I could decide to change it to a series of seafood recipes, after all.","When I am reading for research and making notes, I use a cleverly designed curved lap-desk, and I sit up dutifully, mindful of ergonomics and suchlike concepts. When reading for pleasure, I take advantage of the 'recline' in recliner.","Do we value privacy in any real way? Thinking about blogs, Twitter, Facebook, MySpace... all these suggest we value exposure rather more. And instead of challenging this transformation, as they are supposed to - certainly at the more thoughtful edges of the art - novelists are buying into it wholesale.","My privacy concerns have to do with the world, other people, technology intruding upon us - what Talmudic scholars once called 'the unwanted gaze.' Here I see major issues and concerns as society evolves, and I've written often on the subject.","When I was 18 years old, in a more innocent time, my first backpacking trip through Europe, I sneaked into the Temple of Saturn in the Roman Forum after nightfall and spent several hours in there avoiding the guards patrolling.","Liu Fang is a truly gifted, world-famous player of the pipa and the guzheng, classical Chinese stringed instruments.","Writing is never, ever easy but I wake up every morning grateful for the gift of being able to do this.","I had been obsessed with the Arthurian legends all my life, and I knew that that would work its way into any trilogy I wrote. I was fascinated by the Eddas, the Norse and Icelandic legends, Odin on the world tree.","I'm happier not pretending I know anything about El Cid in Spain. He's a Spanish national hero. I'd rather invent a character inspired by him but clearly not identical to him. And then I feel liberated creatively.","I'm still proud of the 'Fionavar Tapestry.' The fact I don't write the same way is as much as anything else the fact a man in his 50s doesn't write the way a man in his 20s does - or he shouldn't.","As many have noted, the peril for authors is that our work space is too easily our play space.","I say 'as it were' or 'so to speak' too often because puns and double entendres keep insinuating themselves into my consciousness as I'm talking.","I never answer, because I can't, which is my favorite among my own books.","Everything you have ever heard about the strangeness of Hollywood is true!","Even if we remember the past, odds are good we'll still repeat it.","In general, the main themes emerge early for each book, even before the storyline and characters, as I research the time and place I want to draw upon. Having said that, every single book so far has offered me surprises en route, and these include motifs that come forward as I am writing.","Significant consequences can begin very inconsequentially. That's one thing that fascinates me. The other thing that fascinates me is how accident can undermine something that's unfolding, something that might have played out differently otherwise.","The very best way I can make any reader believe in the nuts and bolts of an art form... is to know the mechanics, to make the characters grounded in convincing detail.","I don't know a writer who doesn't feel some sense of glamour and magic and a complex, wistful sadness emanating from the expats of the twenties in France. Some of the sadness, of course, is that we weren't there.","I ruefully admit that if the cat is asleep in my chair - which she regards as hers, of course - I tend to leave her there and take the other one.","I have always argued, in a good novel, interesting things happen to interesting people.","I want readers turning pages until three o'clock in the morning. I want the themes of books to stick around for a reader. I'm always trying to find a way to balance characters and theme.","After a while, you start to realize that you should write a book you would want to read. I try to write a book I would enjoy.","I've spent my whole literary career blurring boundaries between genres and categories.","When we work with history, to a very great degree we are all guessing. But by using motifs of time and history in a fantasy setting, we are acknowledging that this educated guesswork, invention, fantasy underlie our treatment of the past and its peoples - and we are not claiming a right to do with them as we will.","Fantasy is more than an escape from the truths of the world and the past: it is an open acknowledgment that those truths are complex and morally difficult. It offers a different route to creating something which will resonate with readers, in a way which resists the erasure of privacy and autonomy which pervades our modern world.","I spent many years writing and directing in radio drama, so I am comfortable with an audience or a microphone, but I do worry about the blurring of an author's public persona with the work itself. A good 'performer' can make a mediocre book sound strong, and a shy author can leave listeners missing the excellence of his or her writing.","The poems were the only thing I wrote that was not for everyone else. Then my editors at Penguin, who were also friends and had seen several of them, aggressively urged me to do a book. Editors can be aggressive, especially after drinks. That's how 'Beyond This Dark House' appeared.","There's a level at which, if you take poetry seriously, the focus it involves... that never goes away.","I grew up in a bookish family, so I read very widely. I was omnivorous, really.","I don't plan ahead; each book finds me. History itself, the resonance of the past with the present, is the common denominator in all of them.","It's worth being suspicious of writers - or anyone! - who does that myth-making thing. There's always a tendency to retrospectively impose structures on a life. Life as it's lived has a far more complex shape."],"Guy Green":["So, without being cold, you really have to try to retain the capacity to help people without becoming too emotional or allowing your own emotions to have full rein.","I've always avoided expressing an opinion about where I think the republican movement should go - if it should go anywhere at all."],"Guy Hamilton":["For years, I've been wondering what could happen to nuclear submarines when they dive and disappear from the surface of the earth for months, without a trace. No one really knows where they are.","My guess is that if they now choose to change of director for every other film, it's just because you can't really change the formula, you can merely try to film it your way."],"Guy Johnson":["I hope to be with you as a writer for a very long time, and I hope that you will enjoy reading my work, because readers are the highest form of life on this planet.","My mother asked me what I wanted for my birthday, so I said I wanted to read poetry with her.","The great thing about being the son of Maya Angelou is that I had the good fortune to grow up around some of the greatest black artists, dancers, singers, musicians, and actors of our time.","Then I thought I was going to be a photographer. I tried a hand at darkroom technician. I played in a band. It took me quite some time to discover that I wanted to write.","With this first novel, I am just above the foothills, but I see the path to the top, and it is my desire to write compelling stories about everything that I find of interest.","It is my desire to be a great writer. I know that I still have a mountain to climb to achieve that."],"Guy Kawasaki":["A good idea is about ten percent and implementation and hard work, and luck is 90 percent.","What I lack in talent, I compensate with my willingness to grind it out. That's the secret of my life.","Different parts of the world have different attitudes to failure. Arguably, it may take more courage to be an entrepreneur in Sydney, or Paris, or London, or Japan, or Singapore... but an entrepreneur sees the world for what it could be, not what it is.","Create something, sell it, make it better, sell it some more and then create something that obsoletes what you used to make.","A large social-media presence is important because it's one of the last ways to conduct cost-effective marketing. Everything else involves buying eyeballs and ears. Social media enables a small business to earn eyeballs and ears.","Entitlement is the opposite of enchantment.","A simple summary of my life is that my parents worked very hard so that I could have a great education, and I took that education and worked very hard to get where I am. I would like my kids' lives to be exactly the same.","I think that no one, or very few, are born as good presenters. It's a skill that you learn. The key is the 10/20/30 rule: 10 slides given in 20 minutes using no font smaller than 30 points. If people just adhered to this rule, they would double or triple the quality of their presentations.","I would like my kids to inherit a world where people succeed because of merit and hard work, not entitlement, and where people accept others for what they are and not try to change them.","When you enchant people, your goal is not to make money from them or to get them to do what you want, but to fill them with great delight.","If you provide enough value, then you earn the right to promote your company in order to recruit new customers. The key is to always provide value.","Every social media post should have a beautiful graphic. If there are two identical stories, the one with the beautiful graphic will always win.","If you have to put someone on a pedestal, put teachers. They are society's heroes.","The good news about entrepreneurship is that your fate is in your hands. The bad news is that your fate is in your hands!","Patience is the art of concealing your impatience.","Great companies start because the founders want to change the world... not make a fast buck.","When I finally got a management position, I found out how hard it is to lead and manage people.","Evangelism is selling a dream.","Social media allows me to pick my times for social interaction.","Many Android users aren't aware of some the things that Android can already do such as supporting the enforcement of companywide security policies, encrypting phone data and providing e-mail and calendar widgets that update in real-time. Our job is to help people and businesses discover and use these features.","My recommendation for SEO is very simple. It's Write Good Stuff. In my mind, Google is in the business of finding good stuff. It has thousands of the smartest people in the world, spending billions of dollars to find the good stuff. All you have to do is write the good stuff; you don't need to trick it.","I have developed a Zen-like approach to the operating systems that people use: 'When you're ready, the right operating system will appear in your life.'","I think a lot of the logic of Google+ is much better in terms of notification of messages to you, in terms of how you post. One very obvious feature is that with Google+, after you post something, you can edit it forever. That is true of both posts and comments. I edit almost every post I make and almost every comment I make.","I do have a peripatetic and active intellectual curiosity.","The jewelry business is a very, very tough business - tougher than the computer business. You truly have to understand how to take care of your customers.","Entrepreneurship is not for everyone.","I started my career counting diamonds and schlepping gold jewelry around the world. The jewelry business is a very, very tough business - tougher than the computer business. You truly have to understand how to take care of your customers.","I love the notification system on Google+. If someone mentions you, you get notified via Gmail. That's very useful for someone like me.","Simple and to the point is always the best way to get your point across.","I think that no one, or very few, are born as good presenters. It's a skill that you learn.","Great companies start because the founders want to change the world... not make a fast buck. Call me a romantic, but I think entrepreneurs should try to change the world. This comes from working at Apple... old habits die hard.","A crash is when your competitor's program dies. When your program dies, it is an 'idiosyncrasy'.","Don't worry, be crappy. Revolutionary means you ship and then test... Lots of things made the first Mac in 1984 a piece of crap - but it was a revolutionary piece of crap.","Leverage your brand. You shouldn't let two guys in a garage eat your shorts.","Ambitious failure, magnificent failure, is a very good thing.","It doesn't matter whether the Dow is 5000 or 50,000. If you're an entrepreneur, there is no bad time to start a company.","At the end of my life, is it better to say that I empowered people to make great stuff, or that I died with a net worth of $10 billion? Obviously I'm picking the former, although I would not mind both.","Good people hire people better than themselves. So A players hire A+ players. But others hire below their skills to make themselves look good. So B players hire C players. C players hire D players, etc.","What you learn in school is the opposite of what happens in the real world. In school, you're always worried about minimums. You have to reach 20 pages or you have to have so many slides or whatever. Then you get out in the real world and you think, 'I have to have a minimum of 20 pages and 50 slides.'","Coming from the U.S., you tend to look at one homogeneous market with 350 million people. But in Europe, every country has its own customs and laws.","Most venture capitalists won't read a business plan unless the entrepreneur is introduced to them by a contact.","Companies in Europe should stop trying to do the U.S. version of a European idea.","If you make money, you might not make meaning.","If you're an entrepreneur and you think that the president makes a difference to your business, you should stay at your current job.","It's easy to say that entrepreneurs will create jobs and big companies will create unemployment, but this is simplistic. The real question is who will innovate.","A 50-year-old company can innovate as well as two guys/gals in a garage.","I merely consider myself a father, and one role of a father is to provide financial resources for his family.","The A-listers and the A+ listers, are reporting the news, they're not making it.","Not many people agree with what I do.","I don't want to make more friends. I have four kids, I have plenty of friends, and all the personal relationships I need.","If you look at my Twitter feed it is 99% links, but 1% is me responding and 1% of a big number is a big number.","Smart, well-meaning people get it wrong when they start believing that the world owes them something and that the rules are different for them.","I'm a lousy predictor of the future.","I travel all the time.","When I was getting my education, I fell in love with the writings of Peter Drucker. He was my hero. I had a naive belief that when I became a manager, it was going to be like Peter Drucker's books. That is, I was going to be the effective executive. I was going to talk to people about their goals. I was going to help them actualize.","The most important thing is that you hire people who complement you and are better than you in specific areas. Good people hire people better than themselves. So A players hire A+ players.","Most people who graduate from college think they have to make a perfect choice. Is it Goldman Sachs? Is it Google? Is it Apple? They think that their first job is going to determine their career, if not their life.","A company should search for every instance of the use of its name and zoom in when there are issues - both good and bad.","I don't take myself that seriously. I'm a pragmatist.","It's hard to name a person who is unpopular who has influence.","Every day, I get five pieces of hate mail: Tweets or hate emails.","People are forgiving of v 1.0 of a product if it's truly innovative and useful. Then you can get away with a lot. But if you're merely marginally improving the status quo, then you better be rock solid.","My perspective is this: my allegiance is to the best product for my needs. For a computer, this means Macintosh. For phone and tablet, this means Android.","My mother taught me not to take any crap from anyone and to stand up for my rights. You might not believe this lesson came from a tiny Japanese woman, but it's true.","What I learned from my kids is that the greatest joy in life is not from material trappings, power, or visibility. The greatest joy comes from your kids. Nothing is even close to my kids in terms of bringing me joy.","There are two ways to approach the application process: trying to hit a home run by getting an immediate 'Yes, here's an offer' or trying not to be eliminated. I recommend the second approach.","The most powerful way to convince the interviewer that you can do the job is to show how much you already know about the industry, the company, and the products/services of the company. In other words, enchant the interviewer with how much you already know.","I've been all over the world meeting with companies and startups and entrepreneurs. And I tell you, they are more similar than different.","You really can't spend money on social media unless you really try. Social media is really more about effort than expense.","I don't think Steve Jobs nauseated people when talking about how great Apple stuff was. The reason why he didn't nauseate people is because it was true. The start of all great marketing is to have a great product.","The right algorithm is to put off seeking funds for as long as physically possible. And in an ideal world, a startup would never have to seek funds at all.","As communicators and marketers, people are so accustomed to thinking from the 'top down.'

You play to win the Stanley Cup. It has to be the objective.","When trouble comes, it's your family that supports you.","Being drafted by the Montreal Canadiens, that was the greatest moment in my career. And stealing the Stanley Cup in 1978 and bringing it back to my hometown of Thurso.","I realized that my family was more important to me than downtown night life.","Go ahead, work hard and never be afraid to try something. Even if you don't make it, at least you can say you tried.","I was working on the farm to get in shape, about a mile away from my parents. You know, I did everything as a kid to stay in shape - jogging, work on the farm, driving the tractor. I'll never forget.","I think it was always there and it was maybe a matter of bringing it out. It was harder than I thought it would be and I had to try harder. I had to regain my confidence, maybe the most important thing. I have learned a lot to relax. I know what I can do now, and I do it.","The crowd doesn't give a crap as long as you bring the money in.","After 13 years, I couldn't accept to be number two.","Anyway, I've never been captain in 16 years in the NHL. But that didn't stop me being a leader in my own way.","Play every game as if it is your last one.","It's nice to go to small places where we had a lot of fans. They followed our career and it's kind of a way to say thank you to them and do it for a good cause.","It's nice to see the young ones 7, 8, 9 years old. It seems like they know you through their parents.","A lot of the players are not involved with any NHL team, so to play and travel around with the Oldtimers' it's a kind of gift that the players really appreciate.","The players wanted more money, higher salary caps and they didn't have that family relationship we felt with the players. Mentally, the players were more businesslike.","I would compare that to when I first started with the Montreal Canadiens; it was a big family then, where the guys really stuck together and worked like a unit. But when I came back in '88, it was not like that anymore.","That's why I made a comeback in 1988. I knew there were chances of not making it, but I didn't want to end up at sixty years old and say I should have tried when I was thirty-eight.","It was my dream playing for the Montreal Canadiens - it was my dad's team.","I was impressed all my life. Because of the Montreal Canadiens' past, it means a lot because it was a team I cherished as a kid. It was my dream playing for the Montreal Canadiens - it was my dad's team."],"Guy Laliberte":["Life is full of adventure. There's no such thing as a clear pathway.","I am blessed for what I have, but I believed in it from the beginning. Today, the dream is the same: I still want to travel, I still want to entertain, and I most certainly still want to have fun.","Along the way, let's never forget that once we were children and that we were all playing together without distinction of skin color, society level, or where people come from. Adults need to remember to play and to be more childlike in our behavior. We've forgotten what that childlike experience was like.","I don't believe in pitfalls. I believe in taking risks and not doing the same thing twice.","Our approach was very simple. It was about creating a universal language. A show that will be attractive toward every people coming from all over the world. And that was a big thing.","Cirque du Soleil means Circus of the Sun. When I need to take time to reenergize, I go somewhere by the ocean to sit back and watch the sunsets. That is where the idea of 'Soleil' came from, on a beach in Hawaii, and because the sun is the symbol of youth and energy.","All my life I've been flirting. I'm no different. I still carry on the same way.","My first dream was to travel. I was attracted to different places, different colors of skin, different food. When I was 18 in 1977, I went to Europe with my accordion and discovered the pleasure of entertaining people.","I'm a humanist. I always believed, even with Cirque du Soliel, that this is my way to contribute to a better world. I believe I'm very privileged, but many people face the reality when they wake up in the morning of not having food or a glass of water. Life's been good to me, and I believe you have to feed the circle of life.","We are each but a quarter note in a grand symphony.","I believe that the profits will come from the quality of your creative products. Since the beginning, I've always wanted to develop a self-feeding circle of creative productions: the positive financial returns from one show would be used to develop and create a new show, and so on.","I have seen many successful people fail after they start fearing they might lose what they have built.","I am an atheist. I was born a Catholic, but after I had traveled to Northern Ireland with some Catholic friends, and we had a horrible experience with the English Protestant police, I lost all taste for formal religion.","Originally the dream was about traveling and developing a job that would permit me to travel. And I decided to go into street performing because it was a traveling job; it would let me go around the world.","The sun stands for energy and youth, which is what I thought the circus should be about.","We didn't reinvent the circus. We repackaged it in a much more modern way.","We are in a position of financial and social power, and we could be agents of change in our society. Without pretension, I believe we could be a nice little gardener who takes care of the garden, and hopefully our neighbor will do the same. Then, maybe we'll achieve a better world.","Sometimes just being on a beach with my loved ones is all the adventure I need. I am a happy camper and continue to be a citizen of the world. I have yet to discover other cultures, other peoples' dreams and treasures. I will always be a traveler who is discovering beautiful Gaia.","We had every problems starting a big top could have. The tent fell down on the first day. We had problems getting people into the shows. It was only with the courage and arrogance of youth that we survived.","Business is difficult. But it could be approached two ways: Seriously, or with the same way you're doing your job, with entertainment aspect, with pleasure, with fun. And we decided to try to make it as fun that we do our creativity.","I believe in nurturing creativity and offering a haven for creators, enabling them to develop their ideas to the fullest. With more and more talented creators being drawn to Cirque in an environment that fulfills them, these are ideal to continue developing great new shows.","I like to not be too involved in the beginning and during the process so as to keep this fresh look and be able to give constructive recommendation on the final production.","We're not afraid of risking what was our success yesterday in order to explore some new field. We're adventurous. We like the challenge of unknown territory, unknown artistic field, and that's what stimulates us.","Inside every adult there's still a child that lingers. We're happiness merchants - giving people the opportunity to dream like children.","In life I've learned one thing; if you want to be good you have to connect with the best people. So I got very close to the high-stakes players here. I get to watch them and play with them a little bit.","Our biggest goal is to continue to force ourselves to always start our creative work on a white page and not take advantage of past successes and challenging ourselves.","I believe there are so many other disciplines and themes that we still haven't explored yet. It's infinite what we can apply our creativity to.","Trust the young. Young people have a lot to contribute, but generation after generation, those who reach power protect that power rather than teach others how to attain it. I resolved that if I ever became successful, I would trust the young.","There are more and more products with fewer people able to consume them. We have to help those who don't have the economic stability to grow, or one day there will be very few who are able to buy what we're selling.","There are three capitals of entertainment in the world: Las Vegas, New York and London. So far the only one I truly conquered is Vegas. New York and London are still on my checklist.","Ironically, the opportunity to go into space brings you back down to Earth big time! My decision must also take into account my children, my family and my friends. I must be at peace with this decision. And I was. I weighed the risks without letting fear feed on fear. There is no room for fear in my life.","Of all the religions, I am most partial to Buddhism.","I like people that challenge their art, not only in the purist way, but also in terms of how they could provoke and make something different.","Me? I'm going to grow backwards and be a kid again.","I'm an artistic person and a creator. I'm not a scientific. I'm not an engineer.","Actually, I was the seventh private explorer but the first Canadian 'space clown.' I never dreamed of going into space; I just dreamed of traveling. But I admit that space is an incredible destination and the absolute traveling experience.","I do like the thrill of risk-taking, but it's always carefully calculated. I have done many high risk undertakings, but I have always measured the stakes. Not feeding the fear nor the doubt. But I also believe that you need to fuel passion in whatever you do. This is what I am trying to teach my children today.","The creative brand of Cirque du Soleil is creativity.","When you are up there, feeling infinite space, the earth looks like a fragile planet against the immense universe. We are just another fleeting species, passing by. I do believe there is life elsewhere, and we are not alone. But not having found an alternate place for now, it is crucial to take care of the one place we do have.","I always have traveled with a camera throughout my life, but I always had my old 35mm film camera. When I was training to go into space, the only equipment there was a digital camera. I went through a fast-track class on Earth. It actually was fun, though I'm basically a dinosaur with computers.","Business is difficult. But it could be approached two ways: Seriously, or with the same way you're doing your job, with entertainment aspect, with pleasure, with fun.","The planet will adapt to anything. Maybe we should start to use the heart and the brain that we've been given to organize ourselves. Because if we keep screwing up things, we may be just passing by in the history of the planet.","Adaption of the human body in space is not yet mastered. As soon as you hit space, you feel your body is going through a period of mutation. There's no blood in your head; you have a hard time swallowing. We're not born to naturally be in space."],"Guy Madison":["Those are the men who will dance at your wedding.","Prim and proper white women, I like what I see."],"Guy Oseary":["I'm a huge fan of Geffen records. Everything about them - their artists, their videos, their marketing.","One of the things that I've learned working with Madonna is you just move forward. It's really rare that she ever brings up the past.","Dance music is Madonna's base. It's what she likes, it's what she listens to. It's not anything other than that. She doesn't read what's on the charts. And if it's on time, great. This is who she is.","Didn't Lionel Richie just make a country album? No one is giving him a hard time... and God bless him - I love Lionel and should be able to do what he wants to do, like Madonna should, too. Both are having success and I applaud them. If you don't like it, don't buy it. The ageism criticism is getting old.","I am an Israeli-born American citizen.","I welcome viagogo's fresh approach to the entertainment industry and I look forward to helping them build more innovative partnerships in the future.","The labels are in a jam. For a company to do well in music now, it's got to be in all aspects of the business. And Live Nation is the risk-taker. It's leading the charge.","I'm a people person, very approachable. I go out every night, tons of functions. I love all facets of this industry... Music, film, TV, books, art. I love being around creative people.","I've got one outlet now - music - and it's great to be able to sign someone that excites me. I'd like to also be able to do that with the scripts I get or books or TV shows... I'm not going to limit myself.","I wanted to be involved in music and I felt I needed to get in quick. I didn't want to spend four years in college and then hope for the best. I gave myself a year, which is why I kept pushing people for a chance. I literally felt my whole life was in the balance. Music was my life, and I was scared of having time pass by and missing my chance.","Bob Dylan is the Jew of all time.","Most people are blown away by the fact that Beck is Jewish... and Billy Joel. I didn't know he was Jewish.","The new independent spirit at Warner Music is a perfect fit for a stand-alone label like Maverick."],"Guy Pearce":["The thrill of coming home has never changed.","I always think the really unfortunate thing about the Australian film industry is its lack of momentum. And I don't mean this in a derogatory way. I'm always wanting it to pick up momentum, and I'm wondering if that's even possible.","Success comes in waves.","My problem is I'm an addictive personality. I can't have one coffee. I can't eat one piece of chocolate.","I don't feel I'm making a conscious effort to go more commercial.","You work on things and you have such faith in them while you're making them that everything feels special - in a way.","When I go to a movie, I'm always thrilled if I've seen an actor do something and I didn't realize until the end of the movie that that was that person. I love that.","I'll have a different answer tomorrow that I do today.","Doing that hunt scene was really quite demanding. I actually broke a rib during that scene. And then all the scenes after that became quite challenging, just breathing and laughing.","I always look at films as real stories with real people in real situations. That's why I struggle with the whole notion of calling someone the 'good guy' or the 'bad guy', because I think we all have potential to do good things and all have the potential to do bad things.","I grew up doing musicals. I've done so many musicals in my life, I kind of got them out of my system. But, I certainly would be open to them. Rocky Horror Show is a big favorite of mine.","A lot of people are going to hate me for saying this, but one of my least favorite kinds of music, or the kind of music that I feel I've so got out of my system, is musicals music.","The majority of people who join law enforcement are doing it for good, moral reasons, but then there are the few who get through, where you go, 'Whoa, hold on a second. What's this guy doing here?'","I feel I do my best work when it's all there on the page, and I feel that the character is very vivid as I read the script and I'm not having to create stuff and trying to cobble together something. If I have to do that, then I don't entirely trust what I'm doing.","If I'm exhausted, physically and particularly emotionally, I can't tell what's good and I can't tell what's bad and I'm useless.","A movie that gets a PG-13 rating can show someone running down a street killing 27 people. And there are no repercussions.","I've been asked to do action-oriented movies in the past and they just haven't been right for me.","Where do you even draw the line between genres?","I went through a period where I just wanted to punch everybody. Since then, I've had a lot of therapy and I've figured a lot of things out.","I think when people are repressing things, or burying things, that can manifest in all sorts of ways.","Funny enough, if you are looking at people these days who are putting Botox in their face and getting all sorts of plastic surgery, we look at them and go, I can tell you've had Botox. I can tell you've had plastic surgery. You look really strange to me. But no one's saying anything. We're just accepting the fact that they're strange-looking.","Men often still expect women to be under their thumb.","I am geared towards communicating on a female level.","I grew up with such an affinity to cats. I adore the way that they think and operate.","I don't have many friends.","I don't really relate to certain blokey men who just want to talk about blokey things. I never really know what to say and I always feel I have to act blokey in order to have them not say, 'You're a weirdo.'","When you're promoting a film it's really interesting trying to gauge what people think about it.","I think a lot of actors take on fun roles and then they're lazy or flippant with them. I just can't do that.","I don't enjoy movies in 3D. I find I can't engage with the story as well.","I don't understand the actor who plays the same role from movie to movie. Maybe it's because I worked on long-running television when I was in my teens, and so the idea of playing the same role just bores me intensely. I'd rather not do it at all.","You never say never, but I don't think I'd want to do a long-running series.","Comic-strip stuff isn't really my cup of tea, really.","The reality is that we have all these awards and all these festivals that give out awards, so you sort of go, 'okay, well, people liked the film, and I think it's a good film, and it's up for an award - well, I guess it should win the award then.'","I'm far more comfortable in my 40s than I ever was.","The thing I've come to learn is that what's great about small independent films is the intimacy and the communication that occurs when you're making them.","I'll generally write out every scene that's in the film on a couple of pieces of paper, just with a little one-line. And then I can scan it a bit and go, 'This first third of the film, generally, I'm kind of calm.' Then I might do something on one piece of paper that just relates to the energy of the character.","On stage, you've got dialogue you've learned. You've got a paying audience. It couldn't be better, you know?","I tend to project my father figure onto any director that I'm working with, or mother, if I'm working with a female, or it can be confused.","I don't believe in God, but the thing I do believe in is that we're all connected.","Every time you say yes to a film there's a certain percentage of your yes that has to do with the director, a certain percentage to do with the story, a certain percentage with the character, the location, etc.","I just can't talk about things before I do them, because just for me... I give energy away before I've put energy into the job.","I suffer from overheating quite easily.","Well, I never wear shoes at home. Never.","I wish I had the ability to crack wise, generally. You know, without getting punched. There's no way I could do it while getting beaten up. Definitely.","I'm constantly trying to be as original as I can.","It's funny, though, with films, because you can incorporate a variety of elements, and sometimes that can work for you and sometimes I think it can work against you.","You would think that with ten super-famous people in one movie, it's gonna be ten times more popular or viewed, but on some level, they can cancel each other out.","It's hard to pinpoint why all of a sudden a group of Australian films will be doing well and why they perhaps are better made than some from the past.","I'm never there enough to really keep up with what's going on in the Australian film industry. I just try and be part of it as much as I can.","The movie industry is very competitive, and if you're like me and you suffer from your own insecurities about whether or not you're any good, that can be troubling.","Having a partner who has nothing to do with Hollywood helps keep things in perspective.","Growing up, I was a kid pretending to be an adult.","I've always been resistant to parties and schmoozing.","I never really enjoyed the fame stuff.","I'm interested in the psychological exploration of human nature, and it just happens to come in the form of film-making.","Working on films where the money's more important than the creativity, I just get a bit freaked out by that. I just don't feel comfortable."],"Guy Picciotto":["File sharing is our radio; that's the way people hear our stuff.","I think there's always a call for people who are bucking the norm. But I don't expect it to happen now because I think that more than ever the entertainment industry is trying to serve as a distraction, to keep people from thinking too hard.","When we're onstage, it's like mind reading: we're on the same page.","I really think of the studio as being like craftsmanship time, and then playing is about releasing energy, and the two are really different.","I would always rather be working on the band. All that other stuff is stuff I really enjoy doing, but I don't consider it... like, I don't want to be a producer. I don't consider that as my life's goal.","I certainly don't want to be a record label guy.","The guitar gives you a lot of space to cover for yourself, but there's not a lot of room for that on piano."],"Guy Ritchie":["The English countryside is the most staggeringly beautiful place. I can't spend as much time there as I like, but I like everything about it. I like fishing, I like clay- pigeon shooting.","We're quite volatile as individuals, but that doesn't work exponentially when we are together. Relationships are about eating humble pie.","I'm not under too much of an illusion of how smart or un-smart I am because filmmaking ultimately is about teamwork.","Well, what I try to do is throw as much mud on the wall as I possibly can and just see what sticks, what shines as quirky or more interesting that the others, and I try to cling onto that one, somehow join a link from there to there.","Yeah, I'm certainly a lot more confident on this one than I was one the last one, which I think can be a good thing and a bad thing. But, at least I slept while making this film.","My principal job is to make interesting and entertaining films, and I'm not proud of which format or which particular technique I use. I just wanted the film to look good.","It's about not letting the internal enemy, the real enemy, have his way because the more he does the stronger he becomes. The film's about the devastating results that can manifest from the internal enemy being unbridled and allowed to unleash chaos.","I think there's a natural system in your own head about how much violence the scene warrants. It's not an intellectual process, it's an instinctive process.","The best thing to do is find one person in your life and try to love them unconditionally. If you've accomplished that, you've accomplished a lot.","I like death. I'm a big fan of it.","I can understand that the whole world is interested in my wife Madonna. That's even why I married her.","We can all be conned but at what point do we realize that we're being conned and to what point do we allow ourselves to be conned?","They're all based on factual characters. Well, a good amount of them. That's why I was attracted to this genre anyways, because these characters are so large and cartoonish, they're like caricatures, I just felt that there had to be a film made about them.","The idea is that that there is no such thing as an external enemy.","Previously, on Lock, Stock, I went to bed at two in the morning and woke up at five in the morning, and on this one I was known to nod off on the set occasionally.","On Lock, Stock, we didn't know where the money for shooting the next day was coming from.","Jake Green isn't just Jake Green. Jake represents all of us. The colour green is the central column of the spectrum and the name Jake has all sorts of numerical values. All things come back to him within the film's world of cons and games.","In fact, 95% of the people in my films have been nothing less than a pleasure to work with.","If somebody has a better idea than me, I'll take it if it surpasses what we have on the page because at the end of the day, it's me that takes the credit anyway!","I like to think that we've got a plan, so let's stick to it. That said, once we've stuck to it, we're allowed as much improvisation as anyone cares to indulge themselves in.","I got into film-making because I was interested in making entertaining movies, which I felt there was a lack of.","All the other guys I think had a scream on Lock, Stock. They just had a laugh and a crack, and thought it would never come out; they were just having a good time. On this one, I felt that.","After Lock, Stock, all these really nasty small town characters came knocking at my door trying to tell me stories, and somehow I ended up with this guy whose brother was feeding people to pigs, and that's what he did to get rid of people.","Other than the fact that I like a country house, I can't think of anything I'd want to spend my money on.","I love fatherhood. I could bang on about kids forever.","I got too fed up with films that didn't make you think. I liked the idea of one that you'd have to be dancing around with. I like my mind to be engaged when I watch a film.","What I liked about American movies when I was a kid was that they're sort of larger than life and I think I'm still suffering from that reaction.","It's not easy to strap yourself down to a desk and bash on a keyboard when you know you can direct lots of films, because directing films is fun and interactive and gregarious. Writing isn't.","I suppose directing on set is the most fun because it's a good crack and you feel you're on the battlefield whereas writing is a fairly solitary undertaking.","You get a different kick out of all aspects of filmmaking.","We always have a take that's 'one for fun', so once you've got what you need, you can do what you like. Something does occasionally pop out of that tree. I'm always open to ideas.","I'd like to work with the missus, but there's nothing in the pipeline at the moment.","I am not involved in any 'issues' because it's too sensitive for me - or my wife - to get involved. Every time we express an opinion it becomes a whole thing in itself. And the whole purpose of living in the countryside was to get away from hundreds of people. My wife fell off a horse, and suddenly there are hundreds of people around.","I'm not politically motivated. I used to be - passionately. I used to be very Left wing. Then I went very Right wing, and now I rest somewhere in the middle.","We are not that flash, me or the missus. In fact, we are quite low-maintenance."],"Guy Ryder":["When labor migration is properly managed, it is a conduit for skills and wages to flow where they are most needed. It can, and must, be a triple-win, benefiting migrants and their families, their home country, and their destination.","Expanding access to decent work opportunities is the most effective way to increase labor-market participation, lift people out of poverty, reduce inequality, and drive economic growth. It should be at the center of policymaking. The alternative is a dog-eat-dog world in which too many will feel left out.","Placing decent work and social justice at the core of policymaking is simply a recognition of the obvious: none of us can build a better future for ourselves unless we include others.","Social justice is the surest guarantor of peace in the world.","It's not going to be technology. It's not going to be globalization. It's going to be policy decisions and policy settings that will form the future of work.","Look at the experience of 2008. Who are the countries who negotiated the storms of 2008 best? They were the countries which were able to sit business with labor at the table, with government, and work out a way of getting through the storm. And I don't think that is a controversial statement.","If you get better educated, you might yourself higher up the ladder, but the ladder will still be there.","Child labour is a global problem that needs a response from all sides. This means measures to help reduce poverty, improve education, enforce laws, improve employment prospects for adults, and ensure there are no benefits in employing children under working age.","Workers' disillusionment is deepened by the knowledge that, as their average wages grow slowly or stagnate, the very wealthy are growing significantly wealthier.","In the past, action to combat climate change was viewed largely as running counter to economic growth, with 'going green' implying a sacrifice of prosperity for the sake of the environment. Today, we know better.","Family-supportive policies, which enable women to remain and progress in paid employment and encourage men to take their fair share of care work, are crucial to achieving gender equality at work.","We need economic growth that is sustainable and job-rich rather than just statistically impressive."],"Guy Spier":["From time to time, you have seminal personalities who really change the way the world sees itself - people like Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela. Warren Buffett is that kind of person in the business world.","For most people, attaining the intellectual clarity and emotional detachment that investing requires is tough.","Warren Buffett has shown you can be very, very successful without being rapacious, while still being honest, without engaging in constant legal battles.","When Warren Buffett says the sun shines out of somebody's backside, it's worth paying attention.","I do not use short selling. The fund has not shorted a stock since the 2002 to 2003 time frame. At that time I did short three stocks, on which I broke even on two and made money on one of them. The experience taught me that I was not going to be using short selling going forward for a slew of reasons.","The trend of the market is up, not down. Shorting stocks puts you against that trend and thus makes it more difficult to make money.","We think we control our environment, but in fact, it's our environment that controls us. We can't change the world. The only thing we can change is ourselves, by trying to get a better understanding of our own messed-up wiring.","Take any person, put them in the wrong environment, and they can get off to some pretty bad things. Warren Buffett has said that he would not like to get into debt because he doesn't want to discover what behavior he's capable of.","I learned to see myself and my role as a capitalist... as somebody who's trying to harness, for myself and for society, the power of greed and the power of the will to acquire into something that makes the world a better place. That's the version of capitalism that we want.","One has to divide Warren Buffet into different periods. There is a continuously evolving style of Warren Buffett.","Over the time that I followed Warren Buffett, one CFO told me, it's very important to pay attention not only to what Warren Buffett says and what he actually does - often there are subtle differences between the two."],"Guy Standing":["Globalisation began what should be called the Great Convergence, creating a globalising labour market in which wages in emerging market economies slowly converge with wages in rich economies, generating a steady drop in real wages across Europe.","Collective action remains the best way of renewing the march towards the great trinity of liberty, equality, and solidarity.","If I care for an elderly relative without payment, it is not work, is not counted in national income, and, as it is not labour, is not counted as work. Should my neighbour pay me to do precisely the same tasks, it would contribute to economic growth.","Many low-income people in the U.S.A. charged with a crime opt to plead guilty to a lesser offence because they cannot afford to go to trial.","In 1936, John Maynard Keynes predicted the 'euthanasia of the rentier' before the end of the 20th century. It did not happen.","The IP system is an artificial construct that excessively rewards owners of intellectual property, granting them monopolies over inventions and ideas that, in many cases, are the product of generations of thinkers and/or publicly funded research.","A primary justification for a basic income is social justice.","Growth in village economies is often ignored. It should not be.","The primary value of a basic income would be its emancipatory effect.","Every progressive movement has been built on the anger, needs, and aspirations of the emerging major class.","Chronically insecure people easily lose their altruism, tolerance, and respect for non-conformity. If they have no alternative on offer, they can be led to attribute their plight to strangers in their midst.","The precariat consists of a growing proportion of our total society. It is being habituated to accept a life of unstable labour and unstable living. Often they're unable to say what their occupation is, because what they're doing now might be quite different from what they were doing three months ago.","People in the precariat find themselves in the situation where the level of their education and qualifications is almost always higher than the sort of labour that they're going to be able to obtain.","People in the precariat rely very heavily on money wages.","If you're healthier, you tend to have a lower demand for health services.","The precariat faces chronic uncertainty about what to do, about what incomes to expect, about state benefits that might be their due, about their relationships, their homes, and about the occupations they can realistically expect.","Across Europe, not just in the U.K., the old Beveridge and Bismarckian variants of the welfare state have been dismantled. In their place has been erected a mish-mash of means-tested, behaviour-tested social assistance, with a growing tendency to force young unemployed into workfare schemes, which are helping to depress real wages.","Twentieth-century welfare state capitalism was historically unique in that national income was split between wages and profits, labour and capital.","A person looking after a frail former lover is not working and not contributing to economic growth. But if he or she stopped, the state would probably have to take over, thereby adding to growth. So, to increase growth, we should stop looking after our loved ones. Could anybody explain to a passing Martian how this makes sense?","Think how modern economics presents work. Only labour that contributes to growth counts.","The income distribution system constructed in the 20th century has broken down, and it will not come back.","People want to work, but they don't want to necessarily want to do labour.","The evidence shows if you give people security, they become better people. They develop their talents. They become better citizens.","We are in an era of chronic insecurity and growing inequalities. In that context, we need to have new mechanisms for income distribution which give people a sense of security.","Means-tested benefits have one incredible feature in that they impose huge poverty traps.","If you had a basic income, it would mean that everybody would have a base on top of which their earned income would be taxed at the standard rate of tax. That would increase the incentive to take low-wage jobs.","I don't see basic income as a panacea, but we must have a new income distribution system. The old one has broken down irretrievably.","The precariat has been losing cultural rights in that those in it feel they cannot and do not belong to any community that gives them secure identity or a sense of solidarity and reciprocity, of mutual support.","Millions of people in many so-called democratic countries have lost the right to vote, or never obtain it. And millions clearly feel that the political mainstream is not articulating a vocabulary or policies oriented to their needs and aspirations.","If schooling becomes little more than preparation for the job market and consumption, it cannot produce socially responsible and altruistic citizens.","A rich and diverse commons lowers the cost of living for those who use it. And throughout history, it has been those on low incomes who gain most from the commons.","Think of a public library, worth more for those who cannot afford numerous books. Think of a public waterway or fishing ground. All types of commons have imputed monetary value that together comprise a source of social income. As such, the commons reduces economic inequality and insecurity in society.","Using political power, the elite can induce local authorities to facilitate enclosure and privatisation of land, water, and other hitherto public amenities. And they can pressurise public administrations to cut taxes, reducing financial resources for maintaining the remaining commons.","What distinguishes a commons is that it is not private property, does not have a price, and is oriented towards 'use value' rather than 'exchange value.' It does not exist to generate profits.","Most existing national capital funds have been built up from royalties from oil and other minerals. They need not be limited that way. Most are anything but democratic. That could be changed.","The precariat can be divided into three further groups - atavists, who look back to a lost past; nostalgics, who look forlornly for a present, a home; and progressives, who look for a lost future.","In the interests of competitiveness in a globalizing world economy, governments of all complexions introduced labour-market reforms that promoted flexibility but accentuated the precariat's insecurities.","Corporations and financiers have used their growing influence to induce governments and international organizations to construct a global framework of institutions and regulations that enable elites to maximize their rental income.","The precariat is the first class in history to be losing acquired rights - cultural, civil, social, economic, and political.","The Latin root of 'precariousness' is 'to obtain by prayer.' The precariat must ask for favours, for charity, to show obsequiousness, to plead with figures of authority. It is degrading and stigmatizing.","Globalisation, technological change, and the move to flexible labour markets has channelled more and more income to rentiers - those owning financial, physical, or so-called intellectual property - while real wages stagnate.","Chronic insecurity will not be overcome by minimum wage laws, tax credits, means-tested benefits, or workfare.","Magna Carta only came into being in 1217, when the wording had been changed and parts of the original were extended in the Charter of the Forests. This complementary charter covered liberties granted to the common man, including rights to the commons, grazing, fishing, water, and firewood, and was perhaps the first ecological charter in history.","Nobody should be allowed to fund political parties unless they pay at least 30% tax on all income above the median wage. If that rule applied, the Tory party would be bankrupted overnight.","Every time a government minister or spokesman lauds Magna Carta, let us boo or hiss. Shame them. And let us celebrate what it really means to our history: the ability of an emerging class to make demands against the state for new liberties and rights.","The World Bank and others have been converted to conditional cash transfers (CCT). These provide poor people with cash on condition they send their children to school and for medical treatment.","Public social services, infrastructural policies, and so on are vital. But a basic income should be part of a package of reforms.","If the scale of gas is anything like the claims made by its advocates, it has major implications for the economy and British society. Besides its worrying environmental aspects, it could have adverse effects on income distribution.","A democratically governed national fracking fund should be set up, perhaps similar to what Norway and Alaska have. Areas of drilling should be rented to companies through public tender, with or without subsidies, and a rising share of profits beyond a negotiated upper limit should be deposited in the national capital fund.","Capital is taxed much less than labour; subsidies going to capital, the rich, and middle-income earners greatly exceed the benefits going to the precariat and underclass.","The Magna Carta was the first class-based charter, enforced on the monarchy by the rising class.","The precariat is today's mass class, which is both dangerous, in rejecting old political party agendas, and transformative, in wanting to become strong enough to be able to abolish itself, to abolish the conditions of insecurity and inequality that define it.","Since the crash of 2008 and during the neoliberal retrenchment known as austerity, many commentators have muttered that the left is dead, watching social democrats in their timidity lose elections and respond by becoming ever more timid and neoliberal. They deserve their defeats.","Politicians seem desperate to appeal to their respective versions of the so called 'middle class,' unable to empathise with the precariat and eager to dream up fresh and tougher sanctions against society's wounded.","Politicians should reflect on the well-documented fact that fearful, insecure people lose their sense of tolerance and altruism.","We need a new model of social protection. Let us accept that jobs are not the magic solution - and that in a globalised market, job guarantees are a false promise. Let us accept flexible labour, too. But in return, let us have a society in which everybody has a right to basic security and a more equal access to other insurance-based schemes.","A multi-tier social protection system must be based on a modest basic income so as to enable the precariat to build lives involving a balance of different types of work, not just labour in jobs.","Since all political parties blame the others for the economic mess, it is unfair to attribute unemployment to individual behaviour.","Workfare will merely accentuate the growth of the low-paying, insecure labour market.","Sanctions and workfare make it easier for employers to impose insecure practices on desperate people.","Retraining for the precariat is stressful and demoralising; often, they learn new tricks only to find them obsolescent or unwanted.","In financial affairs and dealings with the state, those in the precariat are disadvantaged since they are usually less well-informed and have to do much more to satisfy demands made on them if they want to gain meagre state benefits.","Successive governments in the U.K. have worked to create a more flexible labour market, which also meant labour insecurity. They allowed wages to drop and non-wage benefits to shrivel, creating worse inequality than statistics reveal.","What we need is a slow time movement to gain control over time and an overhaul of work statistics to give a better perspective on all the work being done and how much of it is undesirable, unnecessary, and demeaning.","The precariatised mind is one without anchors, flitting from subject to subject, in the extreme suffering from attention deficit disorder. But it is also nomadic in its dealings with other people.","Although the precariat does not consist simply of victims, since many in it challenge their parents' labouring ethic, its growth has been accelerated by the neoliberalism of globalisation, which put faith in labour market flexibility, the commodification of everything, and the restructuring of social protection.","Think of how much time is spent looking and applying for jobs. Some of those who have read my book on the precariat have told me they have applied for thousands of jobs. This is scarcely leisure; it is work.","Many in the precariat know they have to spend considerable time just waiting for opportunities to arise.","In the old 20th-century income distribution system, the shares of income going to capital, mainly in profits, and labor, in wages and non-wage benefits, were roughly stable. But that system is no more.","People, in general, want to improve their lives and the lives of their children and other loved ones.","The claim that if people had a basic income they would become lazy is prejudiced and has been refuted many times in many places.","What we can say with confidence is that the technological revolution is worsening inequality, due mostly to mechanisms that limit free markets. It is also bringing about disruptive change that is intensifying insecurity and may indeed lead to large-scale labor displacement."],"Guy Verhofstadt":["Brothers in suffering, brothers in resistance, brothers in ideals and conviction. It is now our duty to further strengthen this bond in order to secure this hard-won freedom for future generations.","There is no miracle cure for the many problems of the world.","Where do you find the strength to brave a barrage of enemy fire and to bring your wounded friends to safety at great risk to your own life? Conviction.","That which concerns everyone must also be discussed and approved by everyone.","Let us face it: in the world today, money and economic strength remain more powerful arguments than the number of people you represent.","The idea that the world can unite without being regulated is clearly an illusion.","Crises are challenges, not calamities.","We don't want protectionism at the heart of the European Union."],"Guy de Maupassant":["Patriotism is a kind of religion; it is the egg from which wars are hatched.","It is the lives we encounter that make life worth living.","The essence of life is the smile of round female bottoms, under the shadow of cosmic boredom.","It is better to be unhappy in love than unhappy in marriage, but some people manage to be both.","The simplest of women are wonderful liars who can extricate themselves from the most difficult dilemmas with a skill bordering on genius.","Every government has as much of a duty to avoid war as a ship's captain has to avoid a shipwreck."],"Gwen Ifill":["Authentic apology is a tricky thing to pull off in politics, which is why it so seldom occurs. Plausible deniability must be preserved. True contrition has to be displayed. Traitors to the cause must be immediately be jettisoned. Most of all, the goal is to stop the bleeding.","Once they have actually left office, we seem to grow fonder of our ex-presidents - and they of each other. That's why so many sighed in approval at Michelle Obama's public display of affection with George W. Bush at last month's dedication of the National Museum of African-American History and Culture.","I've been fortunate enough to write a book and travel the country to sign and sell it, so I can safely say that a five-second burst of conversation while you're scribbling your name, over and over, is not the most reliable way to bond with Americans.","Hyperbole is not easily dealt with. Usually, it collapses under its own weight.","Diversity is essential to the success of the news industry, and journalists must include diverse voices in their coverage in order to reach a broader audience. We have stories to tell, but many in our audience have stopped listening because they can tell that we're not talking about them.","I wanted to be a journalist because I like to ask questions. And I like the idea that someone might feel responsible for answering them.","The President has launched a very agressive campaign of self-defense, with the goal of getting Americans to buy into his vision of America on the world stage.","Journalists are accused of being lapdogs when they don't ask the hard questions, but then accused of being rude when they do. Good thing we have tough hides.","When population shifts - brought about by fair housing laws, affirmative action and landmark school desegregation rulings - political power is challenged as well.","To me, race is not all about grievance. It is also about pride and empathy and humanity and understanding the value of difference. But along with that, there are also expectations that we should set for ourselves and for others. We should expect to be treated as equal citizens.","One of the things that Africa needs, everybody seems to agree, is some measure of debt relief.","The common agenda both sides seem to share is: Whatever works.","History shows that people often do cast their votes for amorphous reasons-the most powerful among them being the need for change. Just ask Bill Clinton.","You would like me to say that the veil will be ripped from the voters' eyes sometime between now and November, thereby restoring the proper version of Democracy to the House and Senate. I won't say that, of course. The simple reason is, I don't know.","Can't disagree with the need for a grasp of history.","We will wait to see if it is a doozy before we decide how to cover it, and what it all means.","Whatever their motivations, lawmakers on both side of the aisle have certainly discovered that immigration is one of those issues that resonate strongly with the public.","Don't count out other amazing programming like Frontline. You will still find more hours of in-depth news programming, investigative journalism and analysis on PBS than on any other outlet.","People do still cheer for the President. And some of the military audiences are more likely to cheer than others. I have seen him speak lately in front of groups like Freedom House, where the applause was a long time coming.","When the President was asked about global warming at a public appearance yesterday, he responded by talking about America's addiction to oil. You make the connection.","Is it unreasonable to have proof of citizenship when entering another country?","On immigration, there are a lot of hurdles before anything arrives at the White House.","There seems to be more abiding interest in unearthing old memos abroad than there is here.","Hope springs eternal, even in politics.","Did I say that the President's entire job is image management? Of course not.","We're not paying attention to the fact that Hillary Clinton is running in 2006. Everyone is looking to her for the future. It's the same with anybody else who's positioning themselves.","If you start to catalog Hillary Clinton's positions between now and 2008, we're going to have a lot of conversations because there are a lot of places for her to go.","A lot of Democrats are not that upset with Howard Dean. Howard Dean gets out here and he says these inflammatory things, and he doesn't apologize. He doesn't back down a little bit.","Folks who are getting their strokes in the South are not as unhappy with Howard Dean. You don't see anybody starting any movement to get him out of office.","I'm a preacher's kid, and we were always told, Act right all the time, because someone's always watching.","Tony Blair - good thing there are not parliamentary elections in this country.","If it were the Clinton people, they'd be sitting around figuring out how to pull themselves out. Instead the president is continuing to go around the country and peddling Social Security, which the needle is not moving on.","It's been years, decades, since a president has lost a major trade initiative. That would be bad headlines.","I learned how to cover race riots by telephone. They didn't pay me enough at my first newspaper job to venture onto the grounds of South Boston High School when bricks were being thrown. Instead, I would telephone the headmaster and ask him to relay to me the number of broken chairs in the cafeteria each day.","Simply as an exercise in efficient politics, Obama '08 rewrote the textbook. His accomplishment was historic and one that transformed how race and politics intersect in our society. Obama is the leading edge of this change, but his success is merely the ripple in a pond that grows deeper every day.","Barack Obama's historic 2008 presidential campaign touched on all the themes I have covered throughout my career and all of the layers of meaning that run through black politics. Ambition. Aspiration. Fear. Folly. It was all on display as Obama boarded the roller coaster that ultimately led to the White House.","I was very conscious of the world being this very crazed place that demanded explanation. I didn't see a whole lot of people who looked like me doing it on television.","I got my first job by exceeding expectations.","My job as a reporter is not to know what I think.","I loved covering presidential politics - not so much because of the candidates but because of the people it allowed me to talk to.","We can't expect the world to get better by itself. We have to create something we can leave the next generation.","I make more money in a week than my father made in a year.","I was taught that the search for truth and the search for justice are not incompatible and are, in fact, essential.","By nature, I am someone who hews to the middle. I need to hear all sides of a story. Unless I am engaged in a tough round of dominoes or Scrabble, I think of myself as unreasonably reasonable.","I believe if we only are talking to people who agree with us, we are failing in some way to understand our world and our country.","Because I have moderated two general election debates - in 2004 and 2008 - I know better than to carp from the sidelines. I am confident in my accomplishment of having had Queen Latifah portray me on 'Saturday Night Live' both years.","Moderating a debate means spending more time with briefing books than with your children. It means writing and rewriting and rephrasing. It means finding a way to be alert enough to notice when your question goes unanswered and nimble enough to decide what you will do about that on the spot.","If someone is complaining about the question or the questioner rather than providing an answer, they're usually trying to change the subject.","I recognize that it often serves competitors best to talk past each other - especially when you are trying to claim the fleeting attentions of voters on a debate stage or on social media. But think how much more clarity we could get if the people who wanted to be president clearly explained why he or she is the better choice.","If Donald Trump has proved anything, it is that there is nothing more powerful than a candidate's voice.","As someone who asks questions for a living, there are few things that annoy me more than people who won't ask for themselves. Social media is a great help, but so is something as simple as turning on your television or powering up your laptop to watch a smart news show.","I am in the bad news business. Seldom do I get to report on puppies, rainbows, or the sounds of children giggling. Well, never.","If there is anything good to be said about my particular line of work, it's that we get to tell people the news they need to hear, and to put it in context. To get to that - for one hour every night on the 'PBS NewsHour,' and for an additional half-hour every Friday night on 'Washington Week,' we have to slog through a lot of tough stuff.","Journalists like to give themselves credit for being on the hunt for 'the truth.' But if we embrace this undoubtedly noble but somewhat haughty interpretation of a calling, we inevitably become susceptible to slam dunk answers.","Truth is, in fact, an elusive concept. It depends almost entirely on where you are standing at the time. It is a human instinct to confuse belief with truth.","I've spent so many years talking about lame ducks in the White House and Congress, and it's never occurred to me to find out what the heck it means. It turns out it's an old English hunting term - something about firing at a duck without quite killing it. In any case, the hobbled duck limps on, at a distinct disadvantage.","One of the best features of my career is that I have gotten to meet and work with some of the most stellar people in the business. From Tim Russert and Jim Lehrer to Bryant Gumbel, Andrea Mitchell and Judy Woodruff, I have learned from the leading lights.","Americans don't mind rich politicians. History is full of them. What they do mind are people who ask for their vote but don't connect with them.","I wish more people read hard copies of the newspaper and watched the evening news from start to finish.","Some years ago, I was fortunate enough to land a reporting job at 'The Washington Post,' which pretty much put me in a state of constant awe. Bob Woodward would dish up ice cream sundaes for anyone stuck working on the weekend."],"Gwen John":["In talking, shyness and timidity distort the very meaning of my words. I don't pretend to know anybody well. People are like shadows to me and I am like a shadow.","To be reserved, secretive, with a passionate violence that causes suffering.","Aloneness is nearer God, nearer reality.","When I was a child, I used to cry all the time."],"Gwen Moore":["It is essential that the women's preventive coverage benefit, including contraception, be available to all women, regardless of what health plan they have or where they work - as Congress intended. Providing access to birth control just makes good sense.","Too many people feel that where you start out dictates where you should end up. I was on welfare and just shy of 19 when my first daughter was born, but I was encouraged to take advantage of my ability and drive and remained in school.","As a former recipient of these services I can honestly say that the overwhelming majority of TANF recipients are hard-working Americans who are down on their luck, and just want an opportunity to better their lives and those of their family through work and access to education.","When elected officials abandon our environment and ruin our natural resources, public health is endangered. I know the importance of providing a clean environment for our children; I have attended more than one funeral for a child who has died from an asthma attack.","We must encourage people to get educated, to get tested, to get involved in the fight against AIDS.","I know all about you. You're the people waiting on the shoreline with the warm towels and the hot chocolate after the woman swims the English Channel.","Violence against women is as American as apple pie. I know, not only as a legislator, but from personal experience.","Violence against women in this country is not levied against just Democrats, but Republicans as well... not just rich people or poor people. It knows no gender, it knows no ethnicity, it knows nothing.","It is only with the passage of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994 that we have been able to put a dent in violence against women, and women have had a place to go.","It is very frightening to see a resurgence of the old mores, or lack thereof, regarding women's rights to their own bodies.","Governor Scott Walker didn't know who he was messing with when he picked a fight with the hard-working union folks of Wisconsin. He must have forgotten that Wisconsin is the Badger State. And badgers are scrappy little creatures. We may look cute, warm and fuzzy, but we have a fighting spirit.","As legislators and as Members of Congress, it is our obligation to speak up for those who are being ignored in our society. The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) does just that.","I was once a welfare recipient and am very aware of the successes and failures of this critical safety net. There are those that would have us believe that those receiving TANF benefits are lazy, shiftless, freeloaders who are just sitting around thinking of another way to suckle from the government teat.","These same people who accuse Planned Parenthood of 'targeting' African-American children, they care about you only while you're in the womb. The minute you crown, you're on your own.","It is important for women to have a choice, to have an opportunity to plan their families, because if they don't, the Republicans have said this is an ownership society. You are on your own, and they're going to begrudge that child everything, from WIC to a Pell Grant to health insurance.","I just want to tell you what it's like not to have Planned Parenthood... you have to give your kids Ramen noodles at the end of the month to fill up their little bellies so they won't cry. You have to give them mayonnaise sandwiches. They get very few fruits and vegetables because they're expensive.","I don't have any rift with President Obama at all. I think that he is operating in an entirely different arena than I'm dealing in. I represent my constituents in the Fourth Congressional District. I'm looking out admittedly for much more narrow interests. I represent the fourth-poorest district.","I've been the co-chair of the Non-Partisan Women's Caucus and vice-chair for several years, taking a leadership role in this women's organization.","The reality is is that Congress is a very male-gendered oriented institution. Out of the, you know, more than 10,000 people who've ever been elected to Congress, you know, only about 250 of them have ever been women.","There's a huge cost in being bipartisan, a tradition started by Newt Gingrich when he took over the House in 1994 and has continued forward, that you dare not vote against the Republican Party even if you're voting against your own initiatives and your own interests.","When you see John Boehner crying, believe you me, it's because he cannot control, uh, that wild contingency called the Tea Party.","Violence against women is as American as apple pie.","There are a lot of people in Milwaukee who have had adverse impacts from Scott Walker. He's managed to mess over everyone in Milwaukee.","You know, I think that the Republicans have made it really clear that they want to end the so-called social safety net from cradle to grave.","Healthcare costs are rising, and not just Medicare and Medicaid, but healthcare in general.","We cannot allow our kids not to have an educational opportunity."],"Gwen Stefani":["I remember when I was in school, they would ask, 'What are you going to be when you grow up?' and then you'd have to draw a picture of it. I drew a picture of myself as a bride.","Life is short and you've got to get the most out of it.","My songs are basically my diaries. Some of my best songwriting has come out of time when I've been going through a personal nightmare.","I try not to be but I'm super-neurotic about diet. I'm neurotic about trying not to be neurotic! I'm like every other girl. I have to try really hard my whole life to try to be fit. And I'm super-vain. And I want to wear cute clothes.","I don't have a strong sense of self-worth unless I'm doing something.","My mom always said I was the peacemaker in the family. My older brother, Eric, was the leader, the creative one. I was just his puppet.","I'm neurotic about trying not to be neurotic!","If I wasn't even famous or had any success, I would still wake up and put tons of make-up on, and put on a cool outfit. That's always been who I've been my whole life, so that's never gonna change. I love fashion. I love getting dressed up. I love Halloween, too.","Now I'm a wife and a mother of two. It's a really different role. I always referred to No Doubt as a marriage, because that's what it's like to be together for so long and go through what we've been through. I can't really have that relationship with them anymore.","I have to be creative to be happy.","Sometimes you have to sacrifice your performance for high heels.","I'm like every other girl. I have to try really hard my whole life to try to be fit. And I'm super-vain.","Being a singer is all about me. About ego. Being a mom is all about being selfless - two different worlds.","It was such a turning point to find that I had a talent and I had something to contribute, somewhere.","My parents always pushed creativity on us, but they made it seem like the fun thing to do.","This last year I kind of stopped working out. I think my body just needed a break. And so I did that, and focused more on feeling good as opposed to beating myself up.","Music has this emotional thing to it, and it touches people in crazy ways. The power of having that power is something that, once you have it, you don't want it to ever end.","I have learned to delegate.","I would love to learn to play something so I don't have to rely on someone to collaborate with.","I'm lucky to not have a real job, to be able to express myself, be creative and be relevant.","You know, I was chubby when I was a little girl. And I have all those issues everyone else has. But I try not to. And I've learned over the years that it's such a waste of time. And people like me whether I'm a little bit fatter or not.","Before, I was really passive, all I cared about was being in love with my boyfriend. I didn't have any creative power, nothing. I don't know that person any more.","It feels like the more I'm out there in the public eye, the more criticism I get. You need to have confidence - that's what it takes to walk out there and sing a song in front of a huge group of people.","I was a different person before I started to write. When I realized I could be a songwriter and that people would listen - that was when I started feeling good in my life.","At first it was my brother's songwriting and I was just doing what everyone told me.","I think I've been able to fool a lot of people because I know I'm a dork. I'm a geek.","As a famous person you think how you're gonna end it, get away and have a normal life.","At a certain point I'm going to want to have a family.","I don't fight with people - like, I can barely fight with my husband because I'll just start crying instead.","I don't mean this in a stuck-up way, but I needed an attitude song.","I imagine my children are going to save me from my vanity and be my passion and fill whatever fears I have of the amazing time I'm having right now being gone.","I was thinking that when I have children, that I should always dress as a character for them, so they think their mom is Alice in Wonderland or Cinderella. It would be totally messed up!","If you're not Prince, you're never going to sound like Prince.","I want to be a guy, but I want to wear a lot of makeup.","Writing songs is super intimate. It's a bit like getting naked.","Being in a band you can wear whatever you want - it's like an excuse for Halloween every day.","You're always tellin' me to go out more, Go ahead, get out and see the world, But then I think, why should I? I'd rather stay home and cry.","I'm vain enough to want do a movie again, but right now more roles are the last thing on my list.","My priorities are always going to be my husband and my family now. That's a huge, huge thing.","I work out five days a week; I can't imagine not doing it.","I'd like to have no rules and eat what I want, but I've learned over the years that I'm so disappointed when I can't wear the clothes I want to wear.","And if I let myself down, appear on stage when I'm not looking my best, it's not fun for me. I just beat myself up about it.","I'm just, like, totally normal. The fact that any of this has happened, that we're sitting here at the Beverly Hills Hotel just gets me going, like, 'What?'","I'm really emotional. I don't fight with people - like, I can barely fight with my husband because I'll just start crying instead. I've learned not to do that.","The one thing that makes me feel super lucky about my financial success is that I have a housekeeper.","I'm vain enough to want do a movie again.","Every record that I've ever made, I listen to it so much before it comes out. As soon as it comes out, I never listen to it again. It's, like, over.","I wish I could write more make-believe. It's a lot easier to write about hard times and when things are going wrong. But I've never been a private person.","I have to tell everyone everything that's going on. It is different once you're married, because that's sacred.","Although I'd always wanted children, it was such an opposite thing to being a singer.","I remember so vividly the first song I ever wrote. It was called 'Different People.'","It's superfun being a mom, but it's hard too.","Finding that balance between work and family is the hardest thing I've ever done - by far.","I've always been a girl who loves to dress up.","I like to make my husband like me more, and he likes it when I'm wearing makeup.","Every day I fail at something.","I've been trying to do films for years. So I've decided to wait until the next good part comes along and develop a record on my own in the meantime.","I'm kind of lazy. I like to lie around with my husband and watch TV and stuff like that.","It takes a lot of selfish time to make music.","Out of all the artistic things I do, music is the most rewarding because it's so hard to write songs.","I like the old, vintage Hollywood look.","Everything works out how it should.","You can't plan anything, right? You can try.","A miracle... my biggest accomplishment is my marriage so far. Because it's hard, everyone knows it's hard.","Being a mom is hard, I think a lot of working moms feel that way.","I got married and decided I wanted to do a dance record, and I didn't ever expect for it to be what it was or for the 'No Doubt' thing to be such a long break, but it was one of those things where you just had to sort of follow your inspiration.","I thought that I was going to be like this earth mother. When people would complain about being pregnant, I was like, 'What are you talking about? It's incredible! Just enjoy it.'","I wanted so badly to have a backup plan for when I'm not performing anymore. Let's be realistic: it's not going to be like this forever.","My mom and dad met at Anaheim High School. After they got married, all they wanted to do was have four children, and they did."],"Gwen Verdon":["I can always remember the dances, even from shows I did 40 years ago.","Sex in a dance is in the eyes of the beholder. I never thought my dances sexy. I suppose that's because I see myself with my face washed, and to me I look like a rabbit.","I always did each show for about two years. So if you play the music, it just comes back to me."],"Gwendoline Christie":["I think everyone loves a slash of red lipstick.","I absolutely love to relax and have fun. I like socializing; I like chatting. I like dancing, mixing with friends.","Genuine and true love is so rare that when you encounter it in any form, it's a wonderful thing, to be utterly cherished in whatever form it takes.","I love being tall. as you literally look at life from a different perspective: it's easier to breeze through life's turmoils; there's more room to breathe.","I describe my personal style as 'mythic space horse with chocolate box tendencies.'","I love a challenge. And I love defying limitation, gender stereotypes, and people's expectations of me as an actress.","Part of the reason why I love acting is that you do hope that somehow your work will connect to people and somehow expand their consciousness somewhat, and being able to challenge notions of prejudice through work - through my work - is really thrilling.","I've always liked fairy tale and spectacle. I wouldn't say I was a fantasy fan, but anything beyond reality I've always found exciting - the work of David Lynch, the work of Tim Burton. But for me, I also love those things that are absolutely about human relationships.","The countryside in Belfast is beautiful. No technical wizardry is needed to show quite how glorious it is in its natural state.","I don't know, so much of women's femininity is tied up with their hair.","People come up to me and say, 'You look so much better in real life.'","The beauty of existence is that we get past the superficialities and material world and hopefully move into - lord - hopefully a bit of depth.","I absolutely love Oprah Winfrey. What a great woman and a great businesswoman. She seems to really campaign for an expansion of global consciousness. I think she's phenomenal.","If I were amazing with a sword, I wouldn't care about the tender things in life.","Everyone has something that defines them, whether they're wildly intelligent or whether they have really big feet.","I'm certainly really rather tall at 6 foot 3, and I've been this way since I was 14, but for years, women who are even 5 foot 10 have come up to me in the street and said, 'Oh, it's so nice to see a woman who is taller than me. I've always felt like a giant.'","As a woman, we all want to feel attractive. We all want to feel that we're making the very best of ourselves so we can accept ourselves.","'Game of Thrones' is a fantasy show not dedicated to any specific time, but it seems to exist in sort of a 1400s medieval fantasy world, and in that setting, I wouldn't have had a six-pack.","I was a semi-professional gymnast as a child. I did rhythmic gymnastics, but I sustained an injury and strained all the muscles in my spine.","I don't really have any interest in playing the same part again and again. Let's just keep everything crossed that doesn't happen.","The whole format of 'Game of Thrones' is that you just don't know what to expect.","My father always said, 'You can do anything a man can do.'","As someone who has always felt at times pretty genderless because of my size, it interests me to challenge ideas of prejudice and femininity, and what it is to be a woman.","I trained in combat, sword fighting, horse riding... It's empowering knowing that I can a break man's nose with my elbow.","I do all my own stunts and come away with bruises and scratches.","I enjoy knocking around with the boys.","Occasionally I get messages from women saying that I've brought them some joy, and that's unbelievably thrilling.","I am still a person with a sense of superficiality that I'm trying to challenge.","Going to the gym is something I haven't done regularly since I was a child.","I quite like looking mucky; it's quite nice not having to care about how you look.","I think everybody has the capacity for change.","Bart The Bear was fantastic to work with. Absolutely brilliant and so, so good. The things that that bear could do to order! He was one of the best actors I've ever worked with.","What I've always loved about gymnastics and one of the many reasons I love watching it now is the combination of skill and freedom it has - the discipline and expression - letting you dance.","I only ever wanted to be a model. This acting thing - three years of drama school - is an accident!","I've always been able to look very different very easily.","There's so many parts of my life that I've struggled with - that so many millions of others struggled with - about being an outsider, about feeling ugly, about having to overcome looking different to other people.","I train three, four, five times a week, protein six times a day, resistance training for at least 45 minutes... it's so very boring. It's really painful. It's laborious.","I loved working with Michelle Fairley.","Terry Gilliam is someone I'd always deeply admired. I saw his films when I was a child.","The fantasy genre has so far rather embraced me, and I'm incredibly grateful for that.","I like to explore characters who are very different to me, or varied parts are very similar to me.","I'd love to work with Lena Headey, Alfie Allen, Charles Dance. I'd love to work with Peter Dinklage.","I love the character of Jaime Lannister. He's just so complex - a character that we love to hate - but it's a lot more complex than hatred. It starts off, and he seems so arrogant and so smug.","My pseudonym is 'George R. R. Martin.' That guy's just an actor.","Rory McCann is an amazing actor and a very strong man.","The characters that I want to play are interesting women. I don't care if they're good women or bad women or vulnerable women or women with a lot of faults or women that we dislike intensely who are malicious.","I would chance saying globally there is a feeling that female empowerment has, at last, become a topic that is fashionable, and more power to that.","Vita Sackville-West is one of my favorite female icons. She was a writer and a prolific gardener, but she also had a relationship with Virginia Woolf, and she was married to Sir Harold Nicolson. She was a woman who lived outside of norms.","I used to do karaoke with Patrick Woolf in a karaoke box, and he would ring me up and say, 'Come down and do karaoke with me here,' and then we'd sing Kate Bush songs and get really, really emotional and theatrical in the booth.","I like to be comfortable. And I don't like to have to worry about having to adjust things if things are too short; I don't want to feel self conscious, so I like to wear things that make me feel empowered.","It's very hard as a tall woman to remove your deliberately pronounced feminine aspects and look more masculine.","My parents treated my height as a wonderful thing to be celebrated, but also normal."],"Gwendolyn Brooks":["We are each other's magnitude and bond.","Don't let anyone call you a minority if you're black or Hispanic or belong to some other ethnic group. You're not less than anybody else.","When you use the term minority or minorities in reference to people, you're telling them that they're less than somebody else.","Poetry is life distilled.","I felt that I had to write. Even if I had never been published, I knew that I would go on writing, enjoying it and experiencing the challenge.","Very early in life I became fascinated with the wonders language can achieve. And I began playing with words.","I've always thought of myself as a reporter.","I am a writer perhaps because I am not a talker.","When you love a man, he becomes more than a body. His physical limbs expand, and his outline recedes, vanishes. He is rich and sweet and right. He is part of the world, the atmosphere, the blue sky and the blue water.","What I'm fighting for now in my work... for an expression relevant to all manner of blacks, poems I could take into a tavern, into the street, into the halls of a housing project.","Exhaust the little moment. Soon it dies. And be it gash or gold it will not come Again in this identical guise.","Look at what's happening in this world. Every day there's something exciting or disturbing to write about. With all that's going on, how could I stop?","Art hurts. Art urges voyages - and it is easier to stay at home.","First fight. Then fiddle.","A writer should get as much education as possible, but just going to school is not enough; if it were, all owners of doctorates would be inspired writers."],"Gwyneth Paltrow":["My life is good because I am not passive about it. I invest in what is real. Like real people, to do real things, for the real me.","I try to avoid barbecue potato chips. They're my weakness.","The simpler things are, the happier they are.","I'll immediately gain, like, 5 pounds even just by thinking about cutting out dessert. It's a nightmare. I decided, for me, the healthiest thing was to eat what I want and just exercise. Some women can watch what they eat, but I just can't do that.","Beauty, to me is about being comfortable in your own skin.","I've had a very interesting career. I get to do amazing things and work with amazing people and travel and learn languages - things most people don't get the opportunity to do.","Taking care of yourself is being there for your kids, like how on a plane, they tell you to put on your oxygen mask first.","Sometimes when things you love get really commercial, you end up feeling betrayed by it.","I'm hard on myself, so I'm working on shifting perspective toward self-acceptance, with all my flaws and weaknesses.","I don't eat red meat, but sometimes a man needs a steak.","The older I get, the more open-minded I get, the less judgmental I get.","I'm not sure how healthy bacon is in general, but I know it's incredibly delicious.","I am who I am. I can't pretend to be somebody who makes $25,000 a year.","I eat whatever I want. I like bread and cheese and wine, and that makes my life fun and enjoyable.","Creating a meal for my friends and family, sitting together, eating, laughing and talking - that is when I am so happy. Oh my God, if you could see how much food I make - I am the original Jewish mother.","I don't eat four-legged animals, but I eat birds, I eat cheese, I eat dessert. I eat everything.","I try to remember, as I hear about friends getting engaged, that it's not about the ring and it's not about the wedding. It's a grave thing, getting married. And it's easy to get swept up in the wrong things.","It changed me more than anything else. You don't want to get to that place where you're the adult and you're palpably in the next generation. And, this shoved me into that.","Women were real box office stars in the '40s, more so than men. People loved to see women's films. I think it was better then, except for the studio system.","When you're so out there in the public eye, people are constantly criticizing every aspect about you.","We feel it's unacceptable to be fat, when it has nothing to do with who the person actually is.","There's something that sort of weirds me out about actors who want to be rock stars, and the other way around too.","The Jewish part of me is superstitious.","The adrenaline of a live performance is unlike anything in film or theater. I can see why it's so addictive.","My life comes down to three moments: the death of my father, meeting my husband, and the birth of my daughter. Everything I did previous to that just doesn't seem to add up to very much.","My father, he was like the rock, the guy you went to with every problem.","My dad always said he couldn't remember a time when I did not want to act.","It's a waste of time for people to say things they think other people want to hear, or try and come off in a certain way. I try to be as honest as I can.","In the theater, you go from point A to point Z, building your performance as the evening progresses. You have to relinquish that control on a film.","If we were living in ancient Rome or Greece, I would be considered sickly and unattractive. The times dictate that thin is better for some strange reason, which I think is foolish.","I'm an artist, and the need to get inside myself and be creative and be other people is a part of who I am. I don't imagine I'll abandon that completely.","I wasn't the high-school play queen or anything. And my parents would let not me act until I graduated from college.","I was having such a hard time when I made Sylvia. I gave everything I had for that role. It's one or two or three things I'm most proud of in terms of my work. But it was very dark.","I understand what it feels like not to like aspects of yourself. There have been times that I have felt really terrible about the way I look. I have the seed of that feeling.","I understand that if you set out to be a celebrity, then you asked for it, but all I wanted to be was an actor.","I spend a good portion of my dinner-party conversation defending America because no matter what the political agenda, it's still a fantastic, amazing place.","I say what I think, and I stand behind what I say.","I really like where Tony Robbins says that we're all hypnotized to see beauty this one specific way, and it's true.","I put on the fat suit and went outside and walked around. I was really nervous about being found out, but nobody would even make eye contact with me. It really upset me.","I moved to New York from California when I was 11, so initially I was seen as the California person for a while. I didn't feel like I was popular, but I did feel confident.","I just had a baby. I'm not going to work unless it's something really special and meaningful, because I can't imagine missing all that time with my daughter.","I have a very highly developed sense of denial.","I don't know who decided that skinny was more appealing than not skinny. It seems arbitrary.","Because I was newly pregnant, I was sick as a dog, yet I knew all my lines from a year before.","Beauty fades! I just turned 29, so I probably don't have that many good years left in me.","As I absorbed life here and understood it better, I just completely fell in love with England.","Our marriage is between us. If we decide to continue being together or not, it's our business.","My playground was the theatre. I'd sit and watch my mother pretend for a living. As a young girl, that's pretty seductive.","The work gets more difficult as you get older. You learn more and you gather more experiences, there is deeper pain and higher highs.","I sort of look at some peers of mine and I think, 'No, you've got it all wrong!' I just want to tell them all to have babies and be happy and not get sucked into that Hollywood thing.","I never thought that I'd be considered to have a good body. I was bony up top and kind of dumpy on the bottom.","I do 45 minutes of cardio five days a week, because I like to eat. I also try for 45 minutes of muscular structure work, which is toning, realigning and lengthening. If I'm prepping for something or I've been eating a lot of pie, I do two hours a day, six days a week for two weeks.","I love film. After a yummy meal for the whole family and some truly great friends, we often go out to see something beautiful and unique.","I love being. There's so much wisdom in it. You wake up in the morning and you think, Hey, isn't it great just being?","I wouldn't say I'm a very original thinker, but if I have a good experience with something, I'll want to take it further or adapt it in some way.","Luckily, my children love broccoli, and although we sometimes enter into UN-like negotiations about how many 'trees' they need to eat before they can partake of ice cream, it is a vegetable that they tend to embrace.","We've got a wood-burning pizza oven in the garden - a luxury, I know, but it's one of the best investments I've ever made.","When I pass a flowering zucchini plant in a garden, my heart skips a beat.","I know people that I respect and admire and look up to who have had extra-marital affairs.","There have been countless times where I've worked out with my kids crawling around all over the place. You just make it work.","Even actresses that you really admire, like Reese Witherspoon, you think, 'Another romantic comedy?' You see her in something like 'Walk the Line' and think, 'God, you're so great!' And then you think, 'Why is she doing these stupid romantic comedies?' But of course, it's for money and status.","I love to cook and feed people. I cook every day.","What I've learned is I want to enjoy my life, and food is a big part of it.","I love the English way, which is not as capitalistic as it is in America. People don't talk about work and money. They talk about interesting things at dinner parties.","I find the English amazing how they got over 7/7. There were no multiple memorials with people sobbing as they would have been in America. There, they are constantly scaring people, but at the same time, people think nothing of going to see a therapist.","Brits are far more intelligent and civilised than Americans. I love the fact that you can hail a taxi and just pick up your pram and put in the back of the cab without having to collapse it. I love the parks and places I go for dinner and my friends.","I'll take my wrinkles. I don't like the Botox thing.","I feel my dad, I still feel his love, and I still love him. I would do anything to have him back, but half the reason that my life is good, has real, true value, is that he died. I would obviously rather have him alive, but he gave me so much in his death.","I wouldn't say I'm a mummy's girl, but I have grown to have a tremendous appreciation of her as a woman. I was very much a daddy's girl.","In Britain, they have a lot of laws to protect you, and we enforce them very strongly so that our children can stay private figures, and the British press leave us alone, which is great. It means we can go on the Tube into the centre of London because it's quicker and more fun for the kids. We can do normal things.","I love getting cookbooks - people will give them to me, and I read them like novels and file everything away.","I really like cooking according to the season. I like to get creative with what's fresh.","When I venture out to eat, I like to go to places with food that I don't know how to make. So my favorites are Japanese and Indian. Indian food has so much layering of flavor, and the dishes go together so harmoniously.","After I had the kids, I took a break from work, and all my creativity went into my kitchen. I like experimenting.","I'm sort of getting into the idea of nourishing your inner aspect and doing that by investing in your family and making a meal and creating time together.","I love acting, but I have two little kids, and it's 14 hours a day out of the house. You don't get that time back.","Could I use some butter and cheese and eggs in my cooking without going down some kind of hippie shame spiral? Yes. Of course I could.","During the strict macrobiotic chapter of my life, I ate miso soup every day for breakfast and sometimes with dinner as well."],"Gwynne Shotwell":["You can't be on the cusp of innovation and at the forefront of technology if you're wearing blinders. If you don't have an exploration program where you're exploring your world here on Earth, underwater, and in space, then you're wearing blinders and handicapping yourself.","I remember in third grade, I asked my mom, 'How does an engine work?' So my mom bought me a book.","If you're not looking toward the future or trying to improve the current technology, you'll be left behind.","SpaceX is a flat organization. Anyone gets to talk to anyone, and the best idea wins - even if it comes from an intern.","I left Aerospace because I wanted to go build, and put spacecraft together.","The key is to join an industry that you have a passion for. If you love cars, then automotive is where you should end up.","There was a lot of risk taken in the Mercury and Apollo eras, and we don't take those risks anymore. We've designed the systems to eliminate risk, which makes it take forever and cost too much money.","I always encourage employees to feel free to raise any issues that prevent them from getting good work done.","An important skill for all SpaceXers is the ability to accept critical feedback. This is key to anyone's growth and becoming better at what they do.","After I finished my master's degree, I moved to a company called Aerospace Corporation, a big think tank for the U.S. Air Force and the National Reconnaissance Office.","I never felt any issues whatsoever about being a woman in Tech.","From my perspective, it's really risk management to ensure that humans have the ability to go somewhere else in case there were to be some huge disaster on Earth.","I'd love to go to space. I would love to peek out a giant window and look back at the blue marble. There's no question; I'd love to do that.","Consolidating to the point of monopoly has never served the consumer - ever.","I saw what government programs were and how they were executed. In some cases, they were executed beautifully, but in others, there was tremendous waste.","I do want to make something clear: SpaceX does have a lot of government business, but we execute in a commercial fashion.","For whatever reason, college was just not a huge focus for me. I wasn't planning ahead. I just didn't think about it too much.","What would air travel look like if airplanes were thrown out after each flight? No one would be flying in airplanes.","I don't like to camp. Early on, Mars is going to be camping. I think there are people far better suited to do that than me. But when the first Holiday Inn Express shows up, maybe I'll go."],"Gyorgy Ligeti":["But if you go from Moscow to Budapest you think you are in Paris.","If you come from Paris to Budapest you think you are in Moscow.","I don't read such boring things. Life is too short.","Yes, fractals are what I want to find in my music.","In my piano concerto I developed this polyphony to much higher complexity.","Once, in London, the BBC asked me what was my favorite English book. I said Alice in Wonderland.","New York is the dream world, the center of jazz and rock.","It isn't false modesty when I say this, but although I am supposed to be a famous person it doesn't mean anything to me. I just sit at home and work.","For the past ten years I have had no financial problems.","When I was younger I was completely without money - when I was studying in Budapest, when I was a refugee.","I lived under the Nazis and under the Communists.","I know already the music I will write. But the words? I have not yet decided.","Stravinsky used Mother Goose. He was influenced by Mother Goose, indirectly, but very beautifully.","But I do not want to use Hungarian verses for British people.","I only want to give a metaphysic for my music.","I write bars, for the musicians, because they have to be together.","Gesualdo was very important to me, I wanted to do something which corresponded to him.","I don't use old music.","Then, after the war it was impossible to travel, after so many years of Hitler and Stalin.","First of all I listen to music. I like music.","I listen to all kinds of music - new music, old music, music of my colleagues, everything.","I like to stay home and listen to recordings.","Steinberg is great. I should like to meet him.","There is a wonderful Hungarian literature, especially in lyric poetry.","People often thought Leopold Auer was Russian because he lived in St. Petersburg so long, almost fifty years.","My grandfather was not a musician but he was an artist - a painter, a decorative painter.","Perhaps the better word is emotional yes, I am an emotional man.","However, I began composing as soon as I started taking piano lessons.","I was fifteen years old, and I hardly knew how to play a simple Bach prelude on the piano when I began to compose music, and at the most advanced level. I had never studied such things as harmony.","I think it was when I was nineteen, by that time the Jewish laws were already in force and the split was beginning to come about which isolated the Jewish culture.","I continued to study Math and Physics on my own, but one and a half years later I realized that I did want to be a composer, and after that I never changed my mind.","In January 1944 I was called up by the Forced Labor Service, but I deserted on October 10, 1944.","I think a composer is always interested in his last work.","Well I live in Vienna with my wife and son, and I teach in Hamburg, there will be no changes in that respect."],"Gypsy Rose Lee":["Praying is like a rocking chair - it'll give you something to do, but it won't get you anywhere.","I wasn't naked, I was completely covered by a blue spotlight.","I have everything I had 20 years ago, only it's all a little lower.","If a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing slowly... very slowly.","God is love, but get it in writing.","God will protect us, but to make sure, carry a heavy club.","She is descended from a long line that her mother listened to.","I wrote it three times - with a Thesaurus.","This is my present, you know. My present from Mother."]}
