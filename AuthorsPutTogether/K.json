{"K'naan":["The people of Somalia just do not have a voice. They are to me the most forgotten people in the world.","I enjoy mediation. I think the artist's position is often to mend the things we feel are broken. Whether that's between two cultures or two thoughts. We're always trying to reach, trying to expand something.","You have to let the world speak to you and then you speak, you know, so I'm in that moment now where I'm finding the world's voice.","I have moments of darkness, of anger, and moments of rage. They do creep up at the most inopportune times. Not to recognize that in my music would give people a sense of sainthood that I don't necessarily have or even want to have.","I don't feel political most of the time. Sometimes I'm placed in positions because no one else will go there.","I'm an optimist about other people. I'm not an optimist about myself.","My question about my art and my music has always been, 'Am I good, or am I good because?' I'm not the artist who wants to have the 'because' attached.","Hip-hop in Africa has been very often a duplication of an American experience, but in a context that's totally alien to it.","It was interesting to find how dominating American vision is all over the world. I think there's something to be said about the world's mindset and its economics and all of that, and I think it affects the way we see ourselves and it affects music.","From the stage, I can reach a large audience, and you learn from being on stage how much a song reaches, what extent of the crowd a song can reach. I write in a way that can reach most of the audience, but I also wanted to have truly intimate moments as well, many intimate moments, more so than the big moments.","The only way I see the world now is through coming out of and growing up and living in Somalia. In the time of war, everyone was basically trying to live and manage the best they could. But you also had another period which was not a hard time at all - it was just a beautiful time. I lived in both eras.","Somalis really are very musically sophisticated, and they're about their own thing.","I'm not about trying to get and get and get. I feel good when I get, but I kind of feel better when I give.","The poetry I grew up on is really an intense form of poetry; it's so pure and powerful.","The problem is that rap is so often a caricature of its own image. Nobody comes to the table with the seriousness of the effect that it can have; nobody is prepared for that.","You want to reach people, but you also want to reach them in the most authentic way. You now have a mass market and an audience that's listening, but they're in love with a song that means absolutely nothing to you.","I'm writing from a place of - a center of authenticity, somewhere that only I know how to write from.","To reach your goal authentically is probably, in the end, going to mean much more to you than having reached it in a false way.","I faced quite a few challenging times, and in front of those, I was more positive than some people not facing those conditions. I'm actually of the belief now that it is that struggle that offers you that open-hearted hope.","I am one of those people that's never been really cynical about life, you know.","I know that often times a lot of people who work in music, whether they be labels and so on or even artists, want personal recognition. We want to be recognized for something, for what we did. I'd rather my song be recognized for what it's doing and that's important. It's not so important how many people know me.","I wasn't making music consciously when I was younger. I was a musician, but that has its own stigmas. Anywhere on the planet, it's one of the more undervalued positions.","Art isn't held with the same high regard as it is after success. In any country, in any language, you're a loser if you're making music until you prove otherwise.","I think it's a mistake to work on success in career. I've worked on my passions obsessively. How can I say what I want to say more precisely than the last time I said it? Success is such an elusive concept. When you work for it, I think you get it in a way you might regret it.","It's not really that I'm interested in filmmaking. I'm interested in the instrument of it, you know.","It was not my dream to be an artist. How could it have been? I thought, artist, much like a leader, was something you either were or weren't. Never something you set out to be."],"K. A. Applegate":["I hate to witness animals in captivity - or see circus elephants paraded down the streets. When animals are caged, it's a loss of what they are.","I was sure I wanted to grow up to be either a veterinarian or a writer. In fact, I worked for a vet during high school, doing everything from cleaning cages to assisting in surgery.","Hunger and homelessness aren't things we always want to talk about.","I think we have a real obligation when we do have animals in captivity to understand their needs and to care for them as well as we can.","When I was a child, going to a circus with wild animal acts was a rite of passage. These days, it's an act of complicit cruelty.","I really love writing, but I am very easily distracted: my two cats fighting, a rainbow, a TV show... I have to use every trick to keep myself at the computer.","I think all writers write from the time they're really young, and you just start asking the question, 'What if?'","I love any excuse to come to New York - when it's not February.","I live in a high-rise apartment building, so I just have two cats. They're both pound kitties. One of them, Dick, is an evil, foot-biting cat. When I write a tiger morph, I'm always imagining Dick.","I grew up with a menagerie of dogs, cats, gerbils - not to mention three younger siblings.","I've got to believe I'm the first person to win the Newbery who has written a Harlequin romance!","Gorillas may seem terrifying because of their bodies, but they are really magnificent and very gentle.","I tend to write short, brief snippets - I lean toward the chamber music end as opposed to the symphony end of things.","At the end of the day, I'd love to see children stop begging their parents to go to the circus. That's what would make me most happy.","That penetrating gaze, that intelligence; it's hard not to be anthropomorphic when you're looking at a great ape - at any primate - but especially with gorillas. They're just so magnificent.","I was writing at a really young age, but it took me a long time to be brave enough to become a published writer, or to try to become a published writer. It's a very public way to fail. And I was kind of scared, so I started out as a ghost writer, and I wrote for other series, like Disney 'Aladdin' and 'Sweet Valley' and books like that.","One of my first paid gigs was writing psychology quizzes for 'YM,' a monthly teen magazine like 'Seventeen.'","I think younger readers connect so readily to animal characters because they share a certain vulnerability, particularly when it comes to adult humans, who can be a rather unpredictable lot.","One of the reasons I love writing for middle graders, besides their voracious appetite for books, is their deep concern for fairness and morality.","I grew up in an affluent suburban world and never worried about money until I'd grown up and found wonderfully original ways to screw up my life.","I think most writers will say that at the start of each book they think, 'I'm not sure I can do this.' But eventually, you reach a magical point where the story suddenly becomes real to you, and you become totally invested in it.","When we have financial struggles, kids are so much more aware of things than we want them to be.","I think having imaginary friends is an amazing coping mechanism. It's pretty wonderful, and it makes a lot of sense to me.","I hope kids feel gratitude for what they do have.","It occurred to me that a food drive would be a natural way to talk to kids about hunger, which so many of them simply aren't aware of.","Stan is a rescue Chihuahua mix. He was the role model for Bob, the dog in 'Ivan.' The drawings in the book look precisely like Stan.","I think I was 9, and my mom ordered them for me from a catalogue. They bred like crazy, and I was selling gerbils all around Michigan. They wrote a story about me in the local newspaper.","As a species, we can at times be dimwitted and cruel. But we're also capable of learning.","What do we lose without wild animal acts at the circus? Absolutely nothing, except the opportunity to be haunted and heartbroken.","We know about the socially complex lives of elephants: how they communicate, how they bond, how they even seem to grieve. We have ethologists in the field and activists on the ground to thank for that knowledge."],"K. A. Paul":["I can tell you 100 percent Pastor Jones will not burn the Quran tomorrow. There will be no Quran burning.","Does the imam have a legal right to build the mosque at Ground Zero? The answer is yes. But is it the right thing to do? The answer is no. And most Americans, and most moderate Muslims, join with me in that call.","Is it the right thing to burn Qurans? Legally? Can pastor burn Quran tomorrow? People accept legally it is right. But is it the right thing to do? No."],"K. D. Lang":["The sky is an infinite movie to me. I never get tired of looking at what's happening up there.","I just try to live a really simple, natural life, because obviously, life has an impact on your voice.","You have to respect your audience. Without them, you're essentially standing alone, singing to yourself.","Life is so impermanent that it's not about somebody else or things around me, it's about knowing you are completely alone in this world and being content inside.","I just really allowed my muse to be my guide and I just go with whatever I'm feeling.","Heartache is very fertile ground for song-making but so is happiness, so is absolute bliss.","My public image is so low-key, but I get to travel the world and still have an audience and it's really amazing. I don't take that for granted.","I often say fame is kind of like a drug or like sugar: when it's controlling you it doesn't feel good at all.","I believe in monogamy if that's what a couple decides upon together, but it all depends on the personal history and culture of the two involved.","I think masculinity is bravado against the mystery of the universe of women. It's just a fear of not knowing what women have that's so powerful. It's this shield they put up to try to get closer.","As a songwriter you have an umbilical cord to the song and it's hard to expand on your understanding of the lyrics. Whereas when you cover a song you can create your own reason why you're attached to it.","If you knew how meat was made, you'd probably lose your lunch.","Look. Art knows no prejudice, art knows no boundaries, art doesn't really have judgement in it's purest form. So just go, just go.","The older I get, the more I embrace who I am.","When women make their image about youth and sexuality, and not about intellect, that's kind of a dead-end road. So I think it's a combination of self-entrapment and entrapment by society.","I think I have a better sense of my weaknesses - being self-important, selfish and having a big ego probably triggers all the other stuff. I can see myself more clearly.","I feel like at 50 I've decided to become a rock star, which is, you know, typical of me. I always seem to work backwards.","I think I have allowed my voice to experiment with the different genres. And I think that I have just really enjoyed the journey of getting to know my voice and seeing what it's capable of, what it's not capable of.","I mean, I am fully aware of my influence and my responsibility to society in general representing the gay community. But in the same time, I don't represent the entire gay community because it's a vast, vast community, as one can imagine.","I think I fall into a lot of cracks in terms of I'm too something. I'm too this, I'm too that. And my music has never really had a home. I've been this floating alternative. I'm too mainstream for alternative. I'm too alternative for mainstream. And I'm just kind of wandering.","I don't sing anything that hurts my voice.","There are days when I still want to be able to do what I want when I want, but there's also something wonderful about being secure.","I never get tired of exploring Americana or country music, and I always have a little bit of a crooner in me that never seems to go away.","I think I don't sing as hard as I used to sing. I used to kind of hit the accelerator a lot back in my youth, but now it's just being able to control it, and not work it so hard and use more of an emotional or sub textual kind of approach to singing.","I'm nearly 50. I'm past being photographed falling out of bars.","It's just a theory really, but I have always thought that your physical surroundings can shape your voice and personality.","Minimal is the word I'd use to describe how I live and dress, and it's also how I sing. I'm not a big fan of overemoting.","I'm a singer and as long as I can sing - which, thank God, is something that I still seem to be able to do - I'd like to carry on making records.","It was kind of easier for me to do records that didn't take a year or two years of my life to write and to make.","I never, my producer never, we never let myself just sing. We were always trying to get the perfect vocal.","My voice and the styles and genres I sing all express my appreciation for what I hear.","I sort of believe that my voice was preordained; I'm a Buddhist who believes in reincarnation so I think that my voice is a few lifetimes old.","Spend time reflecting on your emotional and physical existence and how that applies to the voice. You have to apply that wisdom and experience when you sing - it's what comes through.","There needn't be a distinction between your life and your music.","I wanted to write songs that would play themselves on stage, songs that sweep you through their current.","Television really has been my vehicle. I don't get played on the radio much, so I've relied on TV a lot.","I just try to speak passionately about things I'm involved in and moved by.","We're in a period where society seems very attracted to flash, and that seeps into people's musical taste.","I don't believe that human beings are necessarily monogamous.","I started singing when I was five. I grew up the youngest of four kids who all studied classical piano, so you could say I've been listening to music ever since the moment of conception."],"K. Eric Drexler":["My greatest concern is that the emergence of this technology without the appropriate public attention and international controls could lead to an unstable arms race.","In thinking about nanotechnology today, what's most important is understanding where it leads, what nanotechnology will look like after we reach the assembler breakthrough.","I've encountered a lot of people who sound like critics but very few who have substantive criticisms. There is a lot of skepticism, but it seems to be more a matter of inertia than it is of people having some real reason for thinking something else.","Likewise nanotechnology will, once it gets under way, depend on the tools we have then and our ability to use them, and not on the steps that got us there.","On the molecular scale, you find it's reasonable to have a machine that does a million steps per second, a mechanical system that works at computer speeds.","If you take all the factories in the world today, they could make all the parts necessary to build more factories like themselves. So, in a sense, we have a self-replicating industrial system today, but it would take a tremendous effort to copy what we already have.","Any powerful technology can be abused.","The really big difference is that what you make with a molecular machine can be completely precise, down to the tiniest degree of detail that can exist in the world.","And that because the moving parts are a million times smaller than the ones we're familiar with, they move a million times faster, just as a smaller tuning fork produces a higher pitch than a large one.","The basic parts, the start-up molecules, can be supplied in abundance and don't have to be made by some elaborate process. That immediately makes things simpler.","The other advantage is that in conventional manufacturing processes, it takes a long time for a factory to produce an amount of product equal to its own weight. With molecular machines, the time required would be something more like a minute.","Today we have big, crude instruments guided by intelligent surgeons, and we have little, stupid molecules of drugs that get dumped into the body, diffuse around and interfere with things as best they can. At present, medicine is unable to heal anything.","You can find academic and industrial groups doing some relevant work, but there isn't a focus on building complex molecular systems. In that respect, Japan is first, Europe is second, and we're third.","But if we can manage it so people don't have things forced on them that they don't want, I think there's every reason to believe things can settle out in a situation that is recognizably better than the one we're stuck in today.","My work at MIT had focused on what we could build in space once we had inexpensive space transportation and industrial facilities in orbit. And this led to various sorts of work in space development.","But while doing that I'd been following a variety of fields in science and technology, including the work in molecular biology, genetic engineering, and so forth.","I had been impressed by the fact that biological systems were based on molecular machines and that we were learning to design and build these sorts of things.","After realizing that we would eventually be able to build molecular machines that could arrange atoms to form virtually any pattern that we wanted, I saw that an awful lot of consequences followed from that.","It's a lot easier to see, at least in some cases, what the long-term limits of the possible will be, because they depend on natural law. But it's much harder to see just what path we will follow in heading toward those limits.","Protein engineering is a technology of molecular machines - of molecular machines that are part of replicators - and so it comes from an area that already raises some of the issues that nanotechnology will raise.","An international race in the relevant technologies is getting under way at this point, not necessarily with an understanding of where that race leads in the long run, but strongly motivated by the short-term payoffs."],"K. Flay":["I've always had a duck personality. Calm above water, feet going crazy below.","There's only so many variations on the basics of human relationships. To me, it's all about the detail and how you tell the story. How you say, 'I love you.'","Mainly, I hope to inspire honesty. We live in a space where so much can be manipulated, and so much is expected to be manipulated - curated, contrived, edited. I think that's a real detriment to self expression and happiness in a lot of ways. In my mind, honesty and vulnerability is the way forward.","The more time passes in your life, I think the greater you understand perspective. So I'm happy that I've had experiences that have reminded me that most exciting things might not feel so exciting later, and the most disappointing things might not be so disappointing later, either.","A college degree is not essential, but if you're already in college, and if it's at all possible, you should definitely try to finish. In college, you have a very supportive community right there, and it can give you opportunities to try out new things.","There's something distinct and interesting about a live performance. There's this weird immediacy that's, for me, really invigorating, and it just feels really rewarding.","I was always very academically focused when I was growing up, and music was something for which I really had no preconceptions or expectations for myself or really any rules. It kind of represented, at least for me, a divergent path of creativity and self-discovery.","It's like there's this boldness that I have where I'm driven by something that I can't name.","I love playing in Chicago. It's the memory lane hometown, which is really nice.","My dad was a serious alcoholic, and ultimately, that's why he died. When you're a child of someone who struggled with things like that, you look for the common thread. Is there a pattern? Is there an inheritance of pathology in some way? That haunts me.","As an independent artist, you control the means of production, which is the ultimate form of empowerment.","When I first started making music, I was all about wordplay and how fast I could rap, but over the years, I've really gained an appreciation for melody. What's cool is that when you're singing, you have to be concise, and when you're rapping, you have the opportunity to be really detailed with your lyrics.","Most of the people at my headline shows are in their 20s, but it varies a ton: like, I've had a six-year-old hug my leg after the show and a 60-year-old shake my hand. It's cool to see people connecting with the music across different generations.","I think, on the rap side of life, I've always been inspired by and respected Missy Elliott for a long time. She's funny and created an image for herself that was non-sexualized but was really interesting and really cool and really kind of avant-garde in a lot of ways.","A lot of people don't even listen to albums start to finish, but I do - for sure.","I went in reverse with this whole thing. People I've toured with were kids who consumed as much hip-hop as they could. I didn't do that until I started rapping.","My songs are a mix of my own weird raised-by-wolves perspective and civilization.","When I was growing up, I wasn't in bands, and had really no intention of ever doing music. I went out to California for college, and kind of on a whim started making music really as a joke, and over the course of the next five years started playing a lot of shows, and music became this really integral part of my identity.","I think the key for any kind of artist - and this transcends music - is a certain degree of authenticity and sincerity.","I think, initially, working on your own is really great because it allows you to just be really free and not worry about how things are perceived or if people are going to think you're an idiot. And once that becomes ingrained, at least for me, I think I'll feel really comfortable to work with other people and still feel that same freedom.","I think, no matter what, when you're writing songs, most people write about the extremes of their experiences.","The more I talk to people who are at a place I'd like to be at, whether its music or writing, or being a doctor or entrepreneur, sometimes you get lucky, and right away something happens. But for most people, the common denominator of success is just working really hard.","Even successful musicians have had periods where people say they suck and no one likes them, even after they've had periods of great success. So I think it's like you just gotta do you and try to stay motivated. Until, you know, you decide to stay home and make spaghetti all day.","The one thing that I've always kind of had, ever since I was a kid, was that I lack a certain degree of self-consciousness, which is alternately good and bad.","When I first signed to RCA, I was sort of excited and shocked that it was happening. But over the next couple of years, it really started to feel like that game you play when you're a little kid - the one where you put your nose on a bat and then spin around and try to walk.","My sound is, at its core, a mix of things. Definitely an imperfect mix, but one that incorporates elements of the music I love - a bit of indie rock, super rhythmic rapping, and lots of synths.","I know that in my own mind, I struggle with a desire to be both entirely absent and entirely present in any given moment.","I'm a big advocate of revisions, of living with something for a month and then realizing what needs changing, what was lazy, what could be better.","Remixes are so much fun. For me, it's like this great release of energy. I like producing stuff for myself, but I also enjoy making music that wouldn't really suit my own vibe.","I'm intrigued by people who are super adept at manipulating their own image. We all do it to a certain extent.","My dad played guitar, and he taught me enough to play some Beatles' songs. But primarily, I was a bookworm. I loved reading and still do. My whole family does. It was part of the family culture. Accomplished literacy was a value.","I was thinking about how we're so in touch with our image now. That conception of ourselves, in a very physical sense, can be oppressive. You find people wanting to be in dark places, not really see themselves, see themselves as a filtered image. A curated image.","More than anything for me, making music is about taking nothing and making something.","I studied psychology and sociology. I think my assumption was that I would go to graduate school, and I don't know what I was going to do after that.","I'm letting inspiration move me, in whatever direction it may, without concern if this sounds too rap or too indie, or there's too many words in it.","What I've discovered and try to integrate into my show is when you're up there, and you are loud and more visible, you're setting a tone for how people can behave and how they can feel comfortable behaving.","I think it's more important than ever to be as vocal as I can be about things I believe in outside of music.","I've always had a complicated relationship with sleep. Even as a little kid, I never wanted to go to bed - it always seemed unfair in some way.","I feel like, for me, different environments are very important to me creatively. I think it's my norm to be on the move.","I was totally sober in college and really, really focused. I just took the time when other people might be partying and just made music and played at the party instead.","I think a part of me thought that I might be interested in academia because I really do love school. I mean that on all levels - I like educational environments; I like being part of that community of learning and exploration. And I like to talk.","A good sign for me, that I'm a good spot mentally, is when I'm super prolific. And I just wake up every day excited to make or replicate music in some way. That's really nice.","I write songs as honestly as I can without worrying about genres or labels. Sometimes I sing, and sometimes I rap, and sometimes I do something in between. I jump around on stage and don't care too much about how I look. I try to be myself even though I'm still figuring myself out.","Even the dark places are places. You're still somewhere.","A constant goal of mine is to try to put myself back in the place when I wrote something - not just to perform it on a surface level, but to re-enter that headspace, that emotion. That's the point of a live show - for it to feel immediate and present and a little bit unpredictable.","'Life as a Dog' is when I really started to feel comfortable, like I had the due north on my compass.","What's become a big theme in my music is my dad as a narrative character. I never had the opportunity to understand our relationship in a more adult capacity. The unknown is great material for any creative outlet.","I'm having this disbelief and dissatisfaction with an establishment that feels like it's moving backward, and I think there's a similar feeling with everyone of my age and in the world of music and artistic stuff. Art is an important way those feelings get expressed and help people process their feelings and opinions.","I liked that music was a window into a world with a lot of unpredictability and chaos; it was almost diametrically opposed to my very regimented day-to-day living.","I hope people describe my music as lyrically driven, cross genre. Kind of alternative, kind of indie, kind of rap, kind of everything.","I don't put a ton of time into my on-stage style, largely because I'm dumb about clothes. But I have friends who are very smart about clothes, and they teach me things. For the show, I'm mainly concerned with feeling comfortable, being able to jump around and get wild.","Pre-show, I warm up my voice, stretch, do a little team huddle, and sometimes throw a shot of whiskey in there, too. After the show, I hang out at merch meeting people and signing things. After that, I usually try to see friends in whatever city we're in, or if I'm super beat, listen to a podcast and pass out.","Hip-hop is rich in musical allusion. It takes something that already existed, respects it, and reuses it.","My default is e-40 because there's no one else in the world who raps like him. I've always loved e-40.","A friend of mine encouraged me to try rapping, so I started experimenting with it, writing verses, seeing if I could fit an extra word or syllable into each line without tripping myself up.","There are people who are profoundly mentally ill. But we now have a very weird perspective on mental illness and what it means. I do think that people are overmedicated.","Feeling anxious or depressed sometimes is part of what it means to be a person, and it might even be essential to success."],"K. V. Thomas":["There should be a policy to have a mechanism in place to decide when and how to import or export.","There are some who complain that there is not enough food grain. But I put the argument that at the moment we use 2000 census population figures and require 50-55 million tonnes for distribution.","I said the export benefit should go to all the farmers in the country through the mills spread across the country, in states like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal. Now what happens? This benefit goes to those mills or export houses in Mumbai. Or in Chennai or in Bangalore."],"KJ Apa":["I never actively went out and studied the American accent. I just came over here to the States, and it was something I was able to do. Like, I never struggled with it.","When I was 13, my mom checked me into a modeling agency. Then, out of nowhere, they asked me to audition for a TV show, which I did, and I got going from there.","I'm really passionate about music. I do love acting, but music is the end goal for me.","My real name is Keneti James Fitzgerald, but K.J. stands for Keneti James, which is a Samoan name.","When I have downtime, music is a big part of my life. Not so much singing, but I play the guitar.","I have a massive Samoan family. And the Samoan culture has always played a massive part of my life. I've got hundreds of family on my dad's side that live in Samoa and in New Zealand. I've just been surrounded by the culture ever since I was a kid.","It's always strange to play a sex object; it's never a natural kind of feeling."],"KSI":["I'm a really nice guy when you meet me, and that surprises a lot of people. I'm not that eccentric in real life - and certainly not that disrespectful. In my own time, I like to just chill out with friends and not get in people's faces.","A lot of people think being at the top means you have to be the best at a certain game. You don't. It's more about personality.","I would say, in a year, I spend maybe half of that playing FIFA. I love it that much.","Essentially, I'm a 21-year-old who's a millionaire through gaming, vlogging, and my online experience. Yo, I'll take it!","A lot of people think YouTube is quite easy, when it just isn't. I've been doing YouTube for six years now, and I'd say the hardest years were definitely the first three or four. You have to constantly put out content that is good just to make people come back to your channel, and I work every single day just to try and expand my brand.","The best decision I ever made was to drop out of school.","I wasn't really into school that much. I was in this building having to cram knowledge I didn't really care for. But on YouTube, I was able to create what I wanted and post it for people to watch.","I had no clue on what I wanted to do when I was younger, so I was pretty lucky with this YouTube thing.","It's pretty cool I'm known for FIFA. If you think of KSI, people instantly think, 'Ah, that FIFA YouTuber.' I didn't think I would be up there as the ambassador of FIFA on YouTube, but I'll take it.","I am trying to make sure that I don't spend on ridiculous things, so that after all this YouTube thing goes, I'm not left there, like, 'Uh oh, I have nothing.'","I'm now a brand. Like, KSI is a brand. It's crazy that it all came from me sitting in my bedroom just making a few FIFA videos.","School taught me how to do a 9-5 job rather than be a person who wants to start a business.","If you're having problems with someone on the Internet, simply block the person and move on. And if you do want to meet people from online, make sure you do your research to make sure you're talking to the person you want to be talking to.","I kept on telling my parents school wasn't for me. And they were like, 'No you need to go university.'","They should just open lots of YouTube schools... as well as, like, a games school, where you can play all types of games. Like, if you want to play racing games, you go there and become a pro at that. Same for football or a shoot 'em up.","When I was, like, 16 or 17, I was just finding out about this YouTube thing. Then I saved a bit and asked my parents for some help to get the recording software and equipment."],"KaDee Strickland":["My father always said, 'Do your best and piss on the rest.' And I think there's a lot of truth to that, because if you've done your best, there's not a hell of a lot more you can do about something.","Oh God, I'm going to get in trouble for saying this, but I grew up falling asleep in church because I was tired from watching horror movies late at night.","As an actor, there is always an opportunity to learn from the other actors you work with.","You are enough, which I believe is critical for any human being to get in their bones.","I'm kind of obsessed with food - I really am.","My father's name is Dee, so when I was born they named me Katherine Dee and they took the K from Katherine and put it with his name, sort of to give me my dad's namesake. But it's hysterical how often it gets misspelled. I used to be like, 'No one capitalizes my D!'","The reason I always loved 'The Omen' so much, and what has always been scariest to me, is anything to do with God. Anything to do with God is quite frightening because fear is something that's very much expressed in a church environment, and I grew up in one. And the fear of God was very much instilled me at a very young age.","I can say this: You haven't lived until you've had to wear a triplet pregnancy belly. You would be amazed at what a girl can learn based on the different months of pregnancy to make her character more interesting."],"Kabir Bedi":["Everything has a place and time.","I'm not the sort to wallow in nostalgia about the good old days.","Delhi is my emotional home. I still dream of owning a home there.","Men are like mascara, they run at the slightest display of emotion.","There's nothing called a perfect pick-up line. Men always have to face the risk of rejection.","I don't believe in murder.","You see, I have many friends in the Hindi film industry.","Love is a beautiful feeling.","The average Englishman has no idea of the dynamism in the music scene here.","I love the stage, I love the process of acting in theatre, but unfortunately, it doesn't pay the bills.","I also said, men are like curling irons, they never get out of your hair. And they are like government bonds, they take so long to mature.","You are probably right when you say that I could get a role in any producer's film if I just asked.","I have never pressurized a producer to do me any favor.","I am going to produce a movie of my own. I am not going to stick to the time-tested formulae of Hindi cinema. I want to make a film for the present generation. So there will be a lot of new faces in the film.","Love just happens, you know.","In the 30 years of my career, I have explored all possible mediums, except radio.","I've dubbed for my roles in Hindi, English, and Italian. Therefore, I'm used to the process. But, dubbing is hard, especially when you are dubbing for a prominent actor.","I'm constantly complimented for my voice, even by random people at the airport!","I'm an international actor, but at the same time, I'm also a Bollywood actor, even though most of my career has been abroad. However, I've always kept in touch with Hindi cinema.","Honestly, I'm willing to experiment with far more variety in roles than I'm given. But ultimately, it's the producer's decision. But, I've done a variety of roles - the evil don, the evil husband... I've done villainous roles, supporting roles, etc.","Acting was merely a pastime; I wanted to make films. But theatre, ah - now that was a labour of love. Can there be anything better than performing without retakes and cuts, in front of people you can see, hearing them breathe in the darkness of the hall?","Acting is the most insecure profession in the world - you're insecure if you're successful, you're insecure if you're not. A tightrope walk without a net. It's a miracle I'm still standing!","I have the greatest love for the rituals of organised religion - the sense of community and belonging it can confer to people. But me, I'm more a questioner than a follower; not by whim or fashion, but as a decision painfully arrived at after much, much thought.","I turned into a monk when my mother went to learn Buddhism in Burma. While she learnt at the monastery, I used to roam around with a begging bowl and ask for food.","I adore 'The Chipmunks.'","Vamps no longer exist. Stars have taken their roles.","The life of an actor is very hard irrespective of the continent you are in. It is doubly hard when you are only eligible for minority roles.","I think I've had an interesting life. I've done films, TV, theatre and got married. I don't have any regrets.","Not all roles you do can be chocolate sweet.","Theatre is done largely for the love of the craft. Television makes you famous. And films immortalize you. That's the relationship between the three.","I am essentially someone who comes from the theatre. I love the theatre. Unfortunately, theatre doesn't pay the bills. Only in theatre abroad, I get a wage.","My parents were no ordinary people. My mother turned Gandhian, and my father was a staunch communist. They named me after the great saint as a symbol of communal harmony.","When Rakesh Roshan called me for 'Khoon Bhari Maang,' it was supposed to be a six month shoot, but I ended up staying for four years doing 12 films.","We should realise that Hollywood is not obliged to write roles for Asian actors.","Whether people choose to have same sex relationships or relationships outside the marriage - whatever happens between two consenting adults should be purely their business, not the state's or the society's.","Every relationship comes with a shelf life; that duration could be a minute or even a lifetime. If, for whatever reasons, a relationship cannot last a lifetime, contrary to what the two people imagined, then both the individuals have to be communicative and have to understand and accept the reality.","I have never been worried about the future. I will always be able to drive my own feet."],"Kacey Musgraves":["I feel like, big city or small town, you can relate to following your parents' footsteps or putting your own dreams on the back burner or vices that we get caught up in - that whole cycle. That's not just a small-town thing. That's a life thing.","My personal style is a big mix. A lot of it's pretty vintage. I love vintage looks. I'm obsessed with the mid '60s era, even '70s, it was a good era for clothes, hair, music, and cars.","I like when people have Western style, but it's throwback Seventies-ish. I like pearlsnap shirts and a bow-tie like the KFC man.","I realize that I'm not going to be everybody's cup of tea, and that's okay. I think that's the point of music.","When something comes to my brain, I don't ignore it. You never know what it's going to turn into.","Look at Loretta Lynn. Look at Jeannie C. Rily singing 'Harper Valley PTA' and Tammy Wynette singing about divorce. They were ahead of their times in a lot of ways.","When I was nine, I was singing western swing: Roy Rogers and Patsy Cline. It got me noticed because no one my age was doing it, but it made me feel inferior because none of my friends could relate to it.","In the beginning, I wrote OK songs, but they didn't have a unique perspective.","Certain kinds of people will always have an issue with my music. But that's fine; it's OK. I don't want to be the McDonald's of music. I don't want to not turn anyone off. If you were everybody's cup of tea, you'd probably be boring.","You can't beat Freddie Mercury. He was a mad man in the best sense possible.","My fans are pretty spot-on with their gifts. This girl that was super into baking had made this entire batch of cookies - there were one with a dandelion on it, one with a trailer, and some had my face.","I'm all about small towns. I think it's a great place to grow up.","When I started out, I wanted to be the kind of artist who could play the CMA Music Festival and then turn around and play Bonnaroo, and I've managed to do both.","I see my fans as music lovers. I really love that. There's no age group or demographic. It's people of all ages and backgrounds. Country people and non-country people. I wanted to make music across the board.","Undeniably, I'm a country singer; I'm a country songwriter. But I feel like I make country music for people who like country music and for people who don't.","Loretta Lynn was one of those ladies a long time ago that opened a lot of doors and paved the way for a lot of ballsy singer-songwriters who weren't just cute.","I used to love, and I still do, Lee Ann Womack. And Alison Krauss. I mean, how many Grammys does she have? She's just remained solid and true and great, and I respect that.","I love words. They're fun. I don't think any word can just be filler. There's no room for it. It's like a puzzle. Every song can be written a million times. How can you say it differently?","I wouldn't ever do a radio edit because I feel like it would totally go against the point of 'Follow Your Arrow.' I just think you're going to like it or not like it.","My parents aren't crazy conservative. They're actually pretty open-minded. But my grandparents are, and where I'm from, East Texas, is the Bible Belt.","It's weird, because the ideas in my songs aren't controversial to me. I feel like I should be able to sing about anything.","I don't push buttons to push buttons. Throwing the rebel card out there is really cheap.","Lee Ann Womack is from near where I grew up in East Texas, so I've always looked up to her. I sang a lot of Dolly Parton as a kid and a lot of traditional western swing, like Patsy Cline and Roy Rogers.","I'm thrilled that country music fans like my stuff, but so do a lot of people outside of country music, people who just love music. My goal is more to reach music lovers than to appeal to a genre. I love country music, and I'm proud to represent it, but I don't obsess over it as a category.","I think if you're everyone's cup of tea, that probably means you're a little bit boring, or you're not pushing yourself. Creativity happens where it's dangerous and scary: where you're not comfortable.","I like to make people think a little bit.","I didn't necessarily grow up in a trailer park, but there is a brief part of that in my life. So I can make fun of it a little bit. I'm not too much of an outsider, where I'm just making fun of someone.","I'm just observing. I don't ever want people to think I'm preaching at them or wearing them out.","I love Lee Ann Womack and John Prine. That's kind of my ideal cross point. If I can sing it like Lee Ann would and say it like John would, then I feel like I've gotten somewhere.","A label's typical plan would be to put something out that's safer and get fans, and then push buttons, but my idea is to push buttons first, scare off the people who are gonna be scared off, and then the right people will like you for who you really are, and stay with you.","A lot of what gets on the radio isn't saying anything other than somebody wants to be famous and will do whatever they're told to get it.","I'd rather have 100,000 people who really get what I'm doing and like it for what it is than a million who can take it or leave it.","If the lyrics are something new, then maybe I want to give it a more traditional form, or the other way around, but not have all one or the other.","I had a blast on tour with Little Big Town. We got to play some beautiful rooms around the country - some really amazing old theaters. And it was just cool to see a band that's been together for so long.","I love vintage cowboy boots, and some days I'm into platform stilettos encrusted in jewels. It's really all over the place.","I do try to shop online and support people who hand-make their stuff, and because you can find stuff that nobody else has.","Fame freaks me out. Do you just wake up different? I don't know how to scale it back if it gets too crazy.","Too many people focus on writing what they think they should write, what should be in a song, what radio would want.","Of course I get angry, but I want to use my brain a little bit and not just smash things.","Obviously, I don't live and die by it, everything my horoscope says. But I feel like there's definitely something to it.","I always draw from things around me that people around me have gone through... The story that could be taken really literally is not from my life exactly. But bits and pieces are, and the sentiment behind it is.","I did tennis for a while, and I was actually on the volleyball team for a minute.","I needed to really pursue music and learn what I needed to learn on my own by getting in and doing it, not by reading a book about it.","I write my songs and just play them, so there are not a whole lot of fireworks. As long as the music comes first, it's OK to have some fireworks. But not the other way around.","It's hard to remember a time when I wasn't writing.","My parents have always had a great sense of humor. And I really appreciate good humor in songs, witty lyrics that sneak up on you and then you listen again, and say: 'That's so funny.' John Prine's songs have always had this really witty tone.","A lot of times, I'm singing things that are observational and am definitely including myself."],"Kacy Catanzaro":["I am very amazed by the runners out there because I like jog to the garbage can outside sometimes, and I get tired.","I've never been afraid of much, and like any normal kid, I liked to push the limits of what I could do.","For obstacle racing, you wanna be as light, lean, and fast as possible. So, if I lift a lot of weights, I'm gonna be a little bit heavier, which will make it harder for me to hold myself up.","Nastia Liukin, I was obsessed with her. And I say was, but really am obsessed with her. She's just so amazing.","There's such a stereotype about men and women. Obviously, people think men are faster and stronger and all these other things, and I don't want people to get sucked into that anymore. I want them to realize that the women are out here and doing just as awesome things. They can be just as great, too.","I try to eat super clean: No processed sugars, no corn syrups, nothing frozen in a box that you can microwave. If I read the ingredient label and I don't know what something is, I assume it's bad.","My dad and I used to watch 'Ninja Warrior' all the time back when it was in Japan. I would always say, 'I could do that,' kind of joking, but obviously kind of serious.","My pump-up songs before I compete are not the usual. They're more girly songs. I love 'The Climb' by Miley Cyrus. It's about the journey and savoring every moment. I have 'The World's Greatest' by R. Kelly on my playlist, too.","I like visualizing a lot, so the night before a competition and right before, I will visualize myself. I'll close my eyes, turn away from everybody, and just see myself doing exactly what I want to accomplish.","Usually I like to work out in the morning before I eat. After the workout, I like to eat a banana and definitely some oatmeal for a little bit extra boost.","During workouts, I listen to Pandora, and I like the '90s pop stations. 'The Backstreet Boys' is fun!","It's nice to look good and have a great body, but you enjoy your life so much more if you are fit. That is the message I definitely want to get out.","I grew up doing gymnastics. It requires discipline, eating right, getting sleep, lots of sacrifice. But the pros outweigh the sacrifice."],"Kacy Hill":["I grew up in Arizona, but I moved to L.A. when I was 18 to model. I was doing work for American Apparel and then got cast in the Yeezus tour. Vanessa Beecroft did the creative direction, and they hired three American Apparel models and nine dancers - it wasn't a lot of dancing; we were mostly just walking.","I take these vitamins that make my hair grow like crazy. They're called Herpanacine, and I get them on Amazon - they've got echinacea and vitamins A and E. They're really good for your immune system, too. You don't get sick, and they really help your skin, hair, and nails.","I went to this little performing arts school in downtown Phoenix. You had to dance or act, and everyone sang in choir. I started out playing the saxophone, but I always wanted to be in an orchestra. That was a dream as a kid, and there aren't a lot of saxophones in an orchestra.","I was on Kanye's Yeezus tour as a dancer, but really, I was a Vanessa Beecroft model. I was one of the three 'dancers' who couldn't dance and was more of an accessory than an individual. Vanessa was pretty involved. Her style is about a lot of standing. It's very simple but haunting.","I myself was a wedding photographer when I was, like, 16.","I have to remind myself constantly that people actually want to hear the music I've made; that's hard for me to digest. I think a live audience is the only tangible evidence you can have that your work is making an impact. It's really humbling.","I have really sensitive skin, so all I use is Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser and Moisturizing Cream, and then during the day, I'll use CeraVe with SPF, but nothing crazy. My skin also gets really dry, so I do a mask from time to time - or if my skin is feeling dull, then I'll put one on.","I have these long nails, but I literally do nothing to them! The thought of filing my nails drives me insane.","'Bloo' is a compilation of a few songs I've written over the past year, inspired by the necessity of finding happiness in the people I choose to surround myself with."],"Kaetlyn Osmond":["To pursue anything, you've got to have fun with it and to just never give up on it.","I knew that things were going to hurt. I knew that things weren't always going to be perfect. But I could trust that I could make it through it.","Nothing would have been accomplished if I didn't start in Newfoundland.","I want each experience on the ice to be everything I have.","I knew my body could take the battle of everyday training and take the battle of falls and bending in ways that bodies really shouldn't bend.","The way I balance life and skating is by enjoying the time I spend away from the rink. When I am not on the ice, I am not focusing on skating.","I know sometimes in the off-season I have to motivate myself to get on the ice because I know there's so long until the competitions begin again.","'Swan Lake' was my favourite piece of music when I was younger, and I never had a chance to skate to it.","When I broke my leg, I never thought I'd ever be skating again let alone be standing on a world podium. I had to relearn how to skate, relearn how to even stand on one foot again. I had to relearn all my technique.","On the ice, I feel like I can become a different person, and the darker dramatics, the Black Swan, is confident: she's free to do whatever she wants, and that attitude helps in my skating. The White Swan is, I feel, more what I'm actually like off the ice: I'm a lot quieter, and if someone tells me to do something, I'll just do it.","A dream can be what wakes you up in the morning and keeps you going every day, whether things are going great or not. You have that dream; you have that passion inside you that you keep pushing forward.","When I saw the movie 'Black Swan,' I liked the darker aspect of it, the more dramatics, and that's what I like to do for my programs.","I love teaching the younger skaters.","When you think of a teenager, you think of hanging out with friends a lot or going to a full-time school. On the weekends, my friends are staying up until, like, one in the morning, and then there's me fighting to stay up until eight.","I was such a goofy kid that, when I won things, people were like, 'Oh, when did that happen?'","I aim to skate as clean as possible.","I never dreamt of the Olympics growing up. It's not something that I watched on TV; it's not something my parents ever talked about.","I'm more thoughtful and aware of how my body feels. I've learned the difference of what is just sore from a hard workout or what's sore from a possible injury.","Skating is really hard, especially women's skating where we're judged in little tiny dresses.","Ultimately, for me, weight is something I have to deal with every year, but I do it with food because I love food. But it's a struggle; it's something that I think about.","I love the classic side of skating, making it look like a full program and not just technical based.","I work with a team of coaches and trainers to make me feel like I am not alone out on the ice.","I need to motivate myself to work hard because only I can skate my program.","Marystown, in Newfoundland, it's where began for me. It's where most of my family still lives and where a lot of my supporters are from.","To be able to stand on the podium and see one Canadian flag raised is one thing, but to see two, it feels like you're not alone.","Figure skating is such an individual sport, but to have a teammate on the podium with you is unbelievable.","Ever since I was a little kid, I loved being the centre of attention. I think it's part of the reason why I loved skating. You're literally in a fishbowl. You're in the middle of the ice by yourself, and the world is watching.","I started skating when I was 2 years old because of my older sister Natasha was a skater, and I wanted to be just like her!","I don't have many hobbies outside of skating. But I do read, watch TV, play with my animals, and try to hang out with my friends every now and then.","Living in Edmonton feels so calm, but there is still so much to experience. I know I can find something to do if I want to have fun."],"Kage Baker":["In 1916, Universal Studios released the first filmed adaptation of Jules Verne's novel '20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.' Georges Melies made a film by that name in 1907, but, unlike his earlier adaptations of Verne, Melies' version bears no resemblance to the book.","I'm still learning my craft, and I've been writing since I was nine.","I detest flying anywhere. Left to my own devices, I'd never leave my keyboard.","Despite what you hear about the publishing industry being a fixed game that you can only get in if you know somebody, I'm here in person to tell you it ain't so. If your stuff is really any good, sooner or later some editor will take a chance on you.","Written and directed by French showman Georges Melies, 'Le Voyage' features one of the most indelible images in cinema history: the wounded Man in the Moon bleeding like a particularly runny Brie, grimacing in pain with a space capsule protruding from his right eye.","We who grew up with 'drop and cover' drills know all too well what wonders science can bring us, and we like to see the guy in the white lab coat suffer a little. Or a lot.","The 1910 Edison film of 'Frankenstein' was itself a dead thing revived by technology.","Let's say you need a perfectly obedient servant who never gets tired, never needs to be paid, and is virtually indestructible. If you're in a galaxy a long time ago and far, far away, you'll just fly off to the local droid auction and pick up one of those shiny gold models with lovely manners.","According to Jewish legend, only the very wisest and very holiest rabbis had the power to make golems, animated servants of clay. Strictly speaking, the golem is not in the same class with Frankenstein's monster, because the golem is neither alive nor dead. He is, rather, the ancestor of all robots.","In 1913, the noted German actor and director Paul Wegener was making a film in Prague when he heard the legend of Rabbi Loew, who created a golem to protect the inhabitants of the Prague ghetto from persecution.","In 1921, Harry Houdini started his own film company called - wait for it - the Houdini Picture Corporation.","I saw the Kino print of 'The Man From Beyond,' but apparently a superior new print has been produced by Restored Serials. Maybe a few snippets of missing footage will close up some of the plot holes, but I have my doubts.","1925's 'The Lost World' is... really, everything a dinosaur movie should be. Like a dinosaur, this classic was once extinct too, existing as mere fragmentary footage and stills, but cinemaphile fossil-hunters have painstakingly excavated bits and pieces from obscure archives and assembled them into a nearly-complete animal.","Back when the concept of organ transplants qualified as science fiction, novelist Maurice Renard wrote a thriller called 'Les Mains d'Orlac.' Call it a bastard offspring of 'Frankenstein;' its plot revolved around the old theme of Science Giving Us Stuff We Shouldn't Have - in this particular case, restoring severed body parts.","For all its flaws, 'The Hands of Orlac' really is a seminal film, and if you're partial to that particular B-movie subgenre of Demon Body Parts, you really ought to see it.","People who like to fume about the manner in which Disney changed beloved classics are often ignorant of history, not to mention the realities of show business.","If you want to see what stage comedians did to get laffs a century ago, watch the 1910 'Wizard of Oz.' I hope you have a high tolerance for pratfalls.","So vast is the shadow cast by the MGM production of 'The Wizard of Oz,' so indelible are its characterizations, so perfect its music, and so assured is its cinematic immortality, that most people think of it as 'The Original.' In fact, it isn't.","A generation before, it had been sagebrush and coyotes; a generation later, it was a burgeoning movie town. But for that brief idyllic time in 1910, Hollywood looked like the perfect place for a successful writer to settle down, build his dream house, and maybe do some gardening.","What has 'The Patchwork Girl of Oz' got in its favor? Quite a lot, from our point of view in 2009. If you want to see how Oz's creator envisioned his own work, here it is.","Romantic Orientalism was fascinated by the color and excitement of a powerful culture, and nearly always approached its subject with love.","For those of you who thought F. W. Murnau's 'Nosferatu' was his greatest film, I have news for you: his 'Faust' blows it out of the water."],"Kai Bird":["Most Americans have no memory of the designs Franklin Roosevelt's New Dealers had for postwar-American foreign policy. Human rights, self-determination and an end to European colonization in the developing world, nuclear disarmament, international law, the World Court, the United Nations - these were all ideas of the progressive left.","I love the Middle East. My earliest childhood memories are of Jerusalem. I love the colors and smells and cadence of Arabic spoken in the streets of Cairo or Beirut. I also love the modernity and verve of Tel Aviv.","One can't live with a child of Holocaust survivors without absorbing some of the same sensibilities that her parents transmitted to her as a young girl. It is an unspoken dread, a sense of fragility, an anxious anticipation of unseen horrors.","Bhutan is a beautiful place. High-end tourists love it.","The reality is that Israel is a multi-ethnic, multireligious society, and it makes no sense to insist as a precondition for peace that its neighbors recognize it as 'the Jewish state.'","By any definition, what happened in Bhutan in the years 1989-93 was ethnic cleansing. The Bhutanese government denies this and has refused to repatriate any of those forcibly expelled.","My father was a Foreign Service officer, a diplomat and an Arabist who spent virtually all his career in the Near East, as it was called in the State Department. So I spent most of my childhood among the Israelis and the Arabs of Palestine, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.","I know the dangers and the seductions of the Middle East. It is part of my identity. I grew up among a people who routinely referred to the creation of the State of Israel as the Nakba - the catastrophe. And yet I fell in love with and married a Jewish American woman, the only daughter of two Holocaust survivors, both Jewish Austrians.","Although I went to college in the United States - Carleton in Northfield, Minnesota - I returned to the Middle East for a year in 1970-71 to study at the American University of Beirut.","It is one thing to be against unilateralism and against nonhumanitarian interventionism - but it is quite another thing to be against humanitarian interventionism.","In 1945, at the beginning of the Cold War, our leaders led us astray. We need to think of the Cold War as an aberration, a wrong turn. As such, we need to go back to where we were in 1945 - before we took the road to a permanent war economy, a national security state and a foreign policy based on unilateralism and cowboy triumphalism."],"Kai Ryssdal":["I don't like running when I'm holding things in my hand, whether it's a dog leash or a baby jogger. My mechanics get all messed up.","I was in better shape when I went into boot camp than when I came out.","I run about four to five miles, three days a week. I have four young children, so pretty much the only time I can get away is real early in the morning.","The funny thing is, I really feel it if I don't run. I start getting sluggish, and I feel like I need to do it. That's how I know that the workouts are working - I miss them if I don't have them.","Once I'm awake, I'm awake, which helps when you have to run in the mornings."],"Kaia Gerber":["Taking time for yourself is crucial when you're surrounded by people all day.","I don't go a day without eating pasta.","The first perfume I remember actually having myself is Daisy.","People expect you to be doing something cool all the time. In a normal life, that's not happening!","It is so key to me to be a good role model for young girls and someone their mom would want them to look up to.","If you only share your best pictures, or your Facetuned self, the thought of people seeing you as you truly are can be scary.","She teaches me to be kind, punctual... and to stand up for myself. And when I think about it, aren't these things every mother should teach their daughter?","Modeling is really what I do during my free time. It's fun for me, so it doesn't feel like work. I choose to do it.","Unless they're superhuman, nobody's going to look perfect all the time.","My mom does mine because I know I would go tweezer-crazy and wind up with no eyebrows at all.","I try to separate my modelling work from my school life because I don't want people to think of me differently or that I am a certain way because of it.","It changes everything when you accept who you are and you don't try to change yourself.","I love the look of full brows that aren't perfectly done - eyebrows on fleek: that's the goal.","Living in Malibu is like being in a bubble, so discovering others that are so different from me has been incredibly gratifying.","She told me that she would support me regardless of what I decided, but I'm so glad that I actually got to be a kid before having to grow up. My mom knows best about this kind of thing.","A lot of people ask me what my mom has taught me about modeling. The truth is the things she teaches me go deeper than what pose to make or what my good side is.","Bruce Weber is an amazing photographer, and Carine Roitfeld's style - and everything she does - is gorgeous.","I really look up to Karlie Kloss.","I can get ready in five minutes, but getting out of bed takes forever.","I'm passionate about breakfast. I wake up hungry, so I always eat a bagel.","I don't sleep well when I'm traveling, so there's nothing I like more than getting in my own bed.","My favourite thing about being a model is the people that I meet. I don't think there's any other job where you get to learn so many things about so many different people. I just love forging new relationships.","I don't really have days where I can sit and do nothing!","I try to keep my social media really close to my personality. Then people can see exactly who I am and what I like to say and the message I want to bring.","As my brother and I get older and busier, I really cherish the time we spend together.","My parents have always taught me to be myself and to follow my instincts.","My mom is very much about 'less is more.' She showed me how to use makeup to enhance your beauty but not to change your face, which I think is important.","Don't make me do karaoke. I'm the worst singer.","I like math, which sounds really nerdy.","My mom and I have the exact same mannerisms - the way we talk and the gestures that we made.","I think I'm a bit more of a rule-breaker than my mom. She's very sweet and very worried. She was valedictorian. I think I got a little bit of an edgier side from my dad.","I'm inspired by other people, but I don't really try to look like a certain person or anything. I kind of just do what I feel like doing.","I'm inspired by people embracing their feminine power and just being who they truly are and not afraid to express themselves.","I just don't touch my brows! Hopefully, leaving them be will pay off so that I still have them in the future.","I love the '70s, '80s, and '90s.","My mom and I aren't the same size. She's a bit taller. And we're not the same shoe size either, which is heartbreaking."],"Kailash Kher":["Don't take things too seriously, and just chill.","Singing is my passion, my first love and the secret of my energy. Music to me is like finding my inner self, my soul. It gives me a great joy to see audiences enjoying with me. I have given my heart to singing. When I sing, I can feel romance in everything around me.","Nepal is a beautiful country with a lot of holy places. I also like the country because it's close to the Himalayas. According to Hindu mythology, that's the abode of Lord Shiva.","I don't follow anything blindly. I have to know the entire thing, if I have to get in to it. It might sound funny to you, but it's like using English language. I use an English word only when I know its meaning and understand its connotation. You won't hear me say, 'What's up, dude' or anything like that just for the heck of it.","My inspiration comes from the common man and nature.","My real guru are my experiences in life - the realisation that you are alone in this world came very early to me.","The worst affected from corruption is the common man.","A man with a silver spoon may get his share of supporters, but he can never be an inspiration for somebody! Patience and hard work are the key to every man's success.","For us Indians, I don't think English can ever exude that magic of emotions which our mother tongue can.","Just like gold, which has to weather very high temperatures to achieve the sheen and shine it finally gets, so also every person has to go through struggles in his life to achieve success.","When the audience enjoys your performance, you feel like a magician who is doing magic. It's a great feeling!","Music is not a work for me - it's a form of meditation, and you don't need to work hard for it.","Music is everywhere and in everything! I draw my inspiration from the day to day activities of my life!","Recording a song for a film doesn't take much time; it's hardly an hour's job, but concerts are constant, and so is travelling, so I've to take time out to work on my albums because I'm passionate about creating my own music. When you love something dearly, you set your priorities accordingly.","There's no meaning to life without music. Everybody has their own connect with music.","The confidence that we Indians are suddenly infused with while doing something wrong is absolutely commendable.","What is most amusing and can happen only in India is that the most posh and big households that I've seen in Mumbai, the 'big city', will have their balconies and windows festooned with rows of baniyans and tauliyas hanging on them.","I am not a methodical singer. I don't follow any process or rules; what I follow is just my heart - whatever I experience, I just write and then compose it.","I don't listen to Bollywood music much. But yes, I listen to Indian music quite often, and other non- film music.","I have been getting offers from international artistes for collaboration all across the globe, but I prefer to work with Indian artistes.","I have created a new genre. It is a soulful creation that comes straight from my heart.","My music is not just about entertainment. It is about enlightenment also.","Singing is a limitless form of expression, and I love to experiment with my work.","I am an untrained musician and a common man's singer.","Bollywood is huge. Anything that's made in large quantity will evidently overshadow others. But that won't stop artistes from making albums. A person who has faith in his music will go ahead.","Music reality shows are a good thing, especially for those seeking a career in music.","A right balance between music and lyrics is important. Music complements lyrics.","My songs are all about celebrating poignant music. While some of them focus on fun and revelry, they are fortunately backed by powerful lyrics. Put together, the lyrics, tune and my voice strive to take the songs to the next level.","A. R. Rahman is truly India's Mozart. His music is celebrated worldwide.","My birthday is a day when all I want is to bask in the love of my family and rarely accept offers for concerts and shows if they are to be held on this day.","I have cut four albums so far, and all of them have been trendsetters and commercially successful. I believe that once you start taking art in commercial terms, it ceases to be art.","Money and good life had never been my goal.","Music companies and buyers are not too encouraging towards independent musicians. Everyone wants to play safe and go with established names, but unless one breaks this routine, no new talent will come and survive.","It's a whole new world out here. The online world is like a blackboard on which, when you write, the whole world can see - and I'm thrilled about this development. I want to make full use of it.","We want our music to reach everybody, so we're using the Internet. Every kid today is online, and we want to make sure our songs reach every one of them.","The problem with working under an outside label is that your music never seems to reach the right people.","I don't add any deliberate nuances to the way I sing. I've seen so much and been all over the world, but I'm glued to my roots, and that comes across.","I play the harmonium. I had learned to use the guitar for a bit before becoming a part of the music industry, but unfortunately didn't pursue it fully. I would love to learn to play the piano because it holds a unique connect for me in terms of rhythm.","I love listening to songs that are from the heart and that touch the heart. So, love is the preferred theme for most of the songs that I sing.","We are all souls, and what I have learnt so far is that while God is male, the souls created by Him are female, so I always had women as my theme, as they are dedicated to Him.","I am not a Ph.D. in economics or a doctorate in literature that I can afford to take my singing lightly. Even if I sing a jingle, I take it as seriously as oxygen.","I've experienced many hardships, but mentally, I've always been older, and that reflects in my actions, too.","Music is the biggest tool of revolution - the best way to reach out to the youth and involve them. If you can't contribute to the world with your art, I don't see the meaning of life."],"Kailash Satyarthi":["Childhood means simplicity. Look at the world with the child's eye - it is very beautiful.","The power of youth is the common wealth for the entire world. The faces of young people are the faces of our past, our present and our future. No segment in the society can match with the power, idealism, enthusiasm and courage of the young people.","Child slavery is a crime against humanity. Humanity itself is at stake here. A lot of work still remains, but I will see the end of child labor in my lifetime.","Child labor perpetuates poverty, unemployment, illiteracy, population growth, and other social problems.","Every single minute matters, every single child matters, every single childhood matters.","I refuse to accept that the shackles of slavery can ever be stronger than the quest for freedom.","From my own experience, I want to say that you should follow your heart, and the mind will follow you. Believe in yourself, and you will create miracles.","The first 'D' is to dream: dream big - not for yourself, but for the country and for the world. The second 'D' is to discover: discover your full potential and the opportunities that surround you; and the third 'D' is to do. 'Do' means to act on your dreams and make best use of the opportunities you have discovered.","I never go to temples, but when I see a child, I see God in them.","I dream for a world which is free of child labour, a world in which every child goes to school. A world in which every child gets his rights.","Every child matters. If we fail our children, we are bound to fail our present, our future, faith, cultures, and civilisations as well.","At about an age when most children start full time schooling, hundreds of thousands of their contemporaries start a lifetime of drudgery in factories and fields, working 12-16 hours daily.","I am representing here - the sound of silence. The cry of innocence. And, the face of invisibility. I represent millions of those children who are left behind, and that's why I have kept an empty chair here as a reminder.","India may be a land of over a 100 problems, but it is also a place for a billion solutions.","Today it is time for every child to have a right to life, right to freedom, right to health, right to education, safety, the right to dignity, right to equality, and right to peace.","The biggest challenge or biggest crisis knocking on the doors of humankind is fear and intolerance.","I have been very strongly advocating that poverty must not be used as an excuse to continue child labour. It perpetuates poverty. If children are deprived of education, they remain poor.","If not now, then when? If not you, then who? If we are able to answer these fundamental questions, then perhaps we can wipe away the blot of human slavery.","World's children cannot wait any longer. While international community debates and issues recommendations, statements and fine speeches, world's children - marginalised, socially excluded, poor and vulnerable - continue to suffer.","Elimination of child labour and access to education are like two sides of one coin. One cannot be achieved without the other.","Today, I see thousands of Mahatma Gandhis, Martin Luther Kings, and Nelson Mandelas marching forward and calling on us. The boys and girls have joined. I have joined in. We ask you to join, too.","The fight against child slavery is the fight against traditional mindset, policy deficit, and lack of accountability and urgency for children across the globe.","Let us democratise knowledge. Let us universalise justice. Together, let us globalise compassion!","There is a triangular relationship between poverty, child labour and illiteracy who have a cause and consequence relationship. We will have to break this vicious circle.","Let us unite the world through the compassion for our children.","I am positive that I would see the end of child labour around the world in my lifetime, as the poorest of the poor have realised that education is a tool that can empower them.","Economic growth and human development need to go hand in hand. Human values need to be advocated vigorously.","We as the governments, workers, employers and civil society must declare a war on child labour. This war cannot be won without strong, committed, coherent, and well-resourced worldwide movement. Equally needed is a genuine and active coordination between intergovernmental agencies at the highest level.","Learning from the experiences of our ancestors, let us together create knowledge for all that benefits all.","Today, in every wave of every ocean, I see our children playing and dancing. Today, in every plant, tree, and mountain, I see our children growing in freedom.","I am thankful to the Nobel committee for recognising the plight of millions of children who are suffering in this modern age.","I am really honoured, but if the prize had gone to Mahatma Gandhi before me, I would have been more honoured.","If you keep on buying things made by child slaves in such conditions, you are equally responsible for the perpetration of slavery.","As the anti-slavery community, we must together ensure that this attention is transferred into concrete action and results.","I call for a march from exploitation to education, from poverty to shared prosperity, a march from slavery to liberty, and a march from violence to peace.","I have come here only to share the voices and dreams of our children - because they are all our children.","We still have a soft approach on the perpetrators of crimes like worst forms of child labour.","More than 30 years ago, when I had embarked upon the fight against child labour, it was not even considered an issue worth any discussion. It was accepted as a way of life in India, much like it was in other countries. Today, no country or business or society can throw this issue away.","Each time I free a child, I feel it is something closer to God.","For me, peace is a fundamental human right of every child; it is inevitable and divine.","Denial of childhood and denial of freedom are the biggest sins which humankind has been committing and perpetuating for ages."],"Kaiser Wilhelm":["Give me a woman who loves beer and I will conquer the world."],"Kaitlin Doubleday":["The business breeds such a deep insecurity. It's the nature of the beast, and there is nothing you can do to get away from that.","Actors in general have some place in them that can be sensitive and easily damaged: not damaged in a bad way, but insecurity, because that's what it breeds, especially in females and female-lead types.","My favorite thing about this business is you're just jammed in a room on a set with like-minded people - writers, directors, and art designers and hairdressers. People who didn't work a 9-to-5 but chose this life. You're going to like at least two or three people in that you love these people so much.","I was thinking of going to college or staying in L.A. to act, and I stayed to give it a chance. I'm glad I did. I've had a lot of wonderful experiences - some horrible ones, but mostly really beautiful ones."],"Kaitlin Olson":["Being mean just for being mean's sake isn't funny.","Breaking is when someone starts to laugh in the middle of a scene, which is so fun to watch.","You know, I have the best parents in the world and I got really, really lucky because they think that everything I do is Oscar-worthy.","With any show, when fans come up to you, they assume you're just like your character.","I think people think of Oregon as such a granola, hippie kind of a place.","The funniest people I know were, not necessarily troubled, but had a harder time in school or were shy or picked on or something like that. I think that you rely on it. 'Well, I don't think I'm cute and no one wants to hang out with me - I'd better start trying to make people laugh.' I think there's an element of that in there.","It would be great to do another television show that was a multi-camera because the hours are so wonderful and you can be a good mom at the same time. The problem is, there aren't a lot of multi-camera shows that I personally like. My aesthetic is more geared toward single-camera shows.","I'm not really the sex symbol type.","I love football.","I trained at The Groundlings and was surrounded by some very funny women and also some very unfunny men. I didn't feel a sense of things being different because I was a girl.","I'd just like to be good at sports. I'm extremely competitive with absolutely nothing to back it up.","Sometimes, I find that just the simplest, cleanest things that are intelligently performed are funniest to me.","You can take anything, and if you explore it right, you can make it funny."],"Kaitlyn Dever":["When someone is bullying you, don't let it get to you. I remember my friends in school, someone said something mean to them, and they really let it get to them. And it really affected them. But I would just say try to ignore it as much as possible and just be yourself.","It's really important that people know about it and the issue in schools because it happens every day to people and it really hurts when people get bullied.","'Last Man Standing' is overall a lot of comedy. And I love doing that.","I love going back and forth from drama to comedy. I love switching it around and showing people that I can do both.","I would have to say that I have to concentrate more when I'm doing comedy. There are so many details that make up any character, but developing a character for a dramatic role seems to come more naturally.","I play guitar and sing when I'm not busy with school and acting.","I think that the main thing that you can learn from watching 'The Spectacular Now' is just learning about growing up and moving on."],"Kaja Foglio":["Steampunk is not a group of children in a classroom, sitting quietly while the teacher reads a story; it's the kids at recess, playing a wild, endless game of pretend.","From a person whose living depends on other people buying her creative work, this may sound odd, but one of my favorite things about the steampunk subculture is its do-it-yourself attitude.","Over the years, I've heard a lot of people who don't feel that they have it in them to do anything creative. They shrug and claim that they 'have no talent.' They say things like, 'Don't quit your day job' or 'Leave it to the professionals.' In the steampunk subculture, I don't hear those things.","Going to the conventions, seeing the incredible amount of love that people put into their clothing, costumes, gadgetry, and art of all kinds, is a huge treat for me."],"Kajal Aggarwal":["I dress according to what suits me and what I am comfortable in.","I think I'm a story-based artiste. So I would opt for the performance-oriented role. I usually go by intuition while choosing a script. Also, I do not analyse my performance, nor do I bother about how my film has been performing at the box office. I personally love challenges and am game for taking up things which I haven't attempted before.","A woman can never have enough shoes.","My grandmother knitted me a crochet top when I was 15. I still fit into it and will never give it away.","I prefer the Telugu film industry, as women are respected more than they are in the Tamil film industry. In Tamil cinema, they care only about their hero, who is God.","Apart from hard work and being in the right projects, you need to re-invent yourself. I'd be bored doing the same thing over and over, and the audience wouldn't like it, too. The trick is to break that monotony.","Trust me: I've been travelling, making movies, and spending the remainder of my time at home.","I recently read an article on how I was dropped from a film because I couldn't dance! It was so ridiculous that I decided to shut up about it. Let people say what they want to. It's such a waste of time.","Akshay Kumar is a senior in the industry, and I consider myself lucky to be working with him. Each film of his opens to a packed house. Today, a film will sell only if you have a story. The audience is smart and won't be taken for a ride. And I'm confident about my movies.","I'm happy that all my films are different from one another.","You can't do anything to a film post its release. I concentrate on working hard, giving the required inputs for the roles, having discussions with my directors and co-stars. It isn't possible to predict the fate of any film. I don't take failures to heart and successes to my head. These are part and parcel of this career.","I don't consider myself a competition to anyone. There is ample space for everyone here. When there are directors who create characters for me, why should I feel bothered or insecure? When it comes to updating myself, I work very hard to relate to the emotions of characters I play.","I've admired Lawrence master from his choreographer days. I love how he experiments and makes it work. I like his attention to detail and the intrigue in his movies.","Certain scripts require an ensemble cast. I'm absolutely fine with that. I will not deprive myself of the chance to be part of a good film because of insecurities or fear of losing my market. But my role must be well-defined.","I've only chosen films that offered me something concrete, even if it is less than what I get to do in the South.","I did not enter the industry to create a certain image. People happened to see me as the friend/sister/daughter next door. I like that association very much. It's close to what I am in real life. As for films, I just focus on the job.","I love adventure sports. And, I love cooking.","We are Punjabis from Amritsar, though I was born and brought up in Mumbai and did my Bachelors in Mass Media, specializing in advertising and marketing.","In my final year of college, I was interning with L'Oreal, when during one of the photo shoots, a photographer suggested I become a model. I was working under Smira Bakshi, who was this really cool chick, as she was loaded, had her fun, and was successful. I basically aspired to be her.","I am most attached to my mother, who always travels with me when I am on an outdoor location or abroad. She is my friend, who I share everything with.","I buy clothes that have repeat value.","I am at a stage where I want to be known as a versatile actor.","As actors, we put in our best, but when people don't like a film, you have to learn to deal with it. I've learnt not to get too emotional.","I studied mass media and brand management and was looking to do an MBA. When an acting offer came by, I thought I'll do one film so that it would look good on my CV. Films happened one after another, in different industries. I'm so glad things turned out the way they did.","I don't believe any color in particular can bring good luck. I think it's just a coincidence that I was introduced in white costumes. That said, the color is very soothing. So, my house is all white.","Portraying visual impairment is difficult. I can see what's going on, but I have to act like I can see nothing. And this can be quite a challenge.","Balancing my career between two industries has never been an issue. I started with a Telugu film and have a soft corner for the south industry, though I've grown up speaking Hindi. I don't think language can be a barrier when it comes to acting. And, since I come from a theatre background, I'm used to memorizing my lines.","I'm very loyal to my south fans and the industry there. So, it's hard for me leave all the love, respect, and admiration and shift base here. I'm a Mumbai girl and have lived here for most of my life. At the same time, I've spent 10 years of my life in the South and feel like a south Indian at heart.","Chiranjeevi sir is extremely humble and gracious. He is a superstar, but he is one of the nicest, sweetest, most grounded individuals.","There are some movies you do for the character; there are some movies you do for the people.","Working with Chiranjeevi sir, I realized the professionalism and attitude they used work with. It's just so contagious. When such a personality is doing that, everyone around, too, would do that out of respect. Work was far more efficient, smoother.","I am trying my best to strike a balance. How many hours a day can I work? I work for 12-15 hours a day; it gets very strenuous. I balance between Telugu, Tamil, and Hindi.","I have watched a number of Megastar Chiranjeevi garu's films after becoming an actress."],"Kajol":["I am mean; I'm nasty at times. I don't feel like talking to people at times. When I am in a bad mood and have had a really awful day, don't come in my face because I am not tolerant and I am not a goddess; I can't handle it after a point. I am going to get up, and I am going to scream, and I am going to say bad things to you.","Motherhood is an amazing feeling, and if you get to relive those special moments while working, it works as an icing on the cake. Kids have always been close to my heart, and working with them is a pleasure for me.","I'd love sloth. I wish sloth would come home and visit me once in a while. I don't consider laziness a sin at all.","I love my body. And, I'm always working out. I'm an exercise freak, be it cardio, weights, t'ai chi or yoga.","I wouldn't do a film like 'The Dirty Picture.' I have a husband and kids, and I won't be able to do justice to such a role. You need a certain mentality and ease to carry such a character.","If you want to lose weight, you have to be obsessed with it. You can't depend upon your dietician, your trainer or various health aids that you have. You have to be organised. And believe me, it isn't that difficult. The first 10 days are terrible because you have to break the lifelong habits that you have made.","By the time you're 30, you know who you are inside. You learn to laugh at things you can't change; you learn to be yourself.","Hand washing is the first basic step towards achieving any millennium goals for development. It saves lives.","When I was 13 or 14, my mother used to gift me books that I was dying to read. Those are my most memorable birthday gifts.","For me, men and women are different. A man is genetically gifted to pull more than a woman. But at the same time, I don't consider women to be any less than men. In fact, I feel we are far more intelligent than them.","I don't really care what other people see me as. I seriously don't. I've always worried about what my opinion of myself is. And I've always thought that it carries most weight. So I don't care what other people's opinion of me is or how they view whatever I've said or done.","I don't think any actor can be satisfied. I am still in the learning phase and hope I am always in the learning frame of mind in acting or in anything else that I do. That's what makes life interesting and worth living.","As far as expectations go, you can never work for expectations. You have to work against them.","I tell my daughter Nyssa, 'You should respect my work, and I will also respect yours when you grow up.' 'Work is worship' is what I have told her.","Earlier, looking lighter or slimmer never mattered to me. Frankly, I didn't care. I had more important things to do. But when I figured that it's not that hard, and I have the time, passion and patience to take it up, I jumped onto the health-wagon. I started working out.","In life, I take my decisions and stand by them. Some decisions may have proven to be not the best, but I have learnt from them, and I've never repeated a mistake again. If someone tells me to turn left, I will go right! I could not have been taught a lesson in any other way rather than by going through it.","I feel like I am doing a lot, but if someone asks me what exactly I have accomplished, I don't know... putting my son to sleep, feeding him, taking care of things in the house amount to a lot of work. But, yes, I haven't arrested 14 criminals in one day or saved the world or anything of that sort!","If I like something, I will pick it up from anywhere and wear it. I don't believe that only branded stuff looks good on you. If it doesn't look good in my eyes, I'll never wear it.","I spend five times more money at a chemist shop than I would at a fashion boutique. Clothes shopping is optional for me; shopping at a chemist store is a must.","I have always been very choosy, but as you grow older, your tolerance for crap becomes less. The role I will do today has to justify the time I take away from my kids and my husband. I love them, spend a lot of time with them and love doing things for them. So to go away for three to six months, I need something equally powerful.","My only reason why I am not doing films is my children. My children need my attention, and it's my duty to give them my time. I have not given birth to them to just dump them and go off to work. I am not that kind of a person.","I am a very strict mother, and as a mother, it's my responsibility to guide my kids and tell them to go how far and no further. There should be rules and guidelines for the kids, and they should know their limits.","If I read in a paper that somebody has said something about me, I'm going to take it with a pinch of salt; I really am!","I believe in my privacy. I always have, and I always will. I don't think that my private life needs to be on display for me to get a better response at the box office or for me to get a better choice of movies.","Everyone has the right to their lives and to look the way they want to! Tomorrow I can put on 25 kilos... it's my choice, my body!","I don't want to be any kind of producer at all - hands-on or otherwise! I feel producing is a very difficult job and creates ulcers! Maybe some people would like to have a certain amount of control; not me. It's too much stress and includes managing everybody's egos... handling my own is enough!","Going out at night and having a fabulous social life takes a lot out of you, and I don't know if I have that much to give, honestly. I would rather give that time to my kids or spend that time reading a book or watching a film. I am selfish and lazy.","Everybody has their own rules, and so do I. I have always lived on my own terms. As far as mistakes are concerned, I've made them and acknowledged them as mistakes, not regrets. I consider my life a success. There's nothing that I would re-do. I've always done what I felt was right.","My kids are in front of the computer 24x7 despite having all the parental control. There is no way to stop the flow of information. The flow of information is too fast and too much.","If you say one gets influenced watching a character, I think it's foolish. Cinema reflects society; society rarely reflects cinema.","I think I am very hands-on mother. I am very strict, and my daughter keeps telling me, 'You are too hard on me,' and I keep telling her, 'I have to be hard because if I am not hard, you will not learn the lessons that I want you to learn.' I think it is really important to be that way.","I was a complete brat but was an angel with my mother. I used to be perfectly behaved, and my mother used to be like... 'Really, are you badly behaved with other people?' I was like, 'No, not at all.' But the minute she used to leave the room, I was a brat.","Oh God, my choice of film has never depended on the hero. In fact, you will see that some of my categorical mistakes had nothing to do with the hero in it.","That's what the sari is about. Everything is covered, yet a peep of an ankle can be a turn on for men.","I've punched a fan in the face because he was obnoxious. I've also pinched a child and made him cry, but I was 10 then!","I have a lot of road rage. Mostly with the rickshaw and cab drivers trying to cut me; it's the traffic. Grrrr!","One thing I am sure of is that I won't judge a dance reality show.","A good project but a poor director will always make a mediocre film, but an average script and good director can make a good film, as he will put in everything to make the film look good.","I can't stand on a podium and beat my chest saying I'm the best. I just think I've been the luckiest of all. Yes, I'm talented. The movies that I've chosen and the way they've fared have also helped. I've always done films I would love to watch. I have stayed away from films which I thought were depressing.","Films are not the sole area in my life. Films are a passion. But it's not like I'll die if I don't get another movie. I'll grow, I'll flourish, I'll learn something new, but I'll always do something that I like. If I get the right film, I'll do it. I will not compromise for anything else.","I know what my comfort zones are. But without a back-up, I will never step out of my comfort zone. I don't go bungee jumping; I won't jump from the third floor without a safety net. I don't do such things. That's not my personality type.","Earlier, my priority was only work. I worked like a dog before I got married. After marriage, once you have a baby, time management is difficult. Your responsibilities change, your priorities change. And you have to concentrate on them if you have to work out your life. Your career is just a part of your life. For me, my family is my life.","There are times when marriage is not such a comfortable place... But you find your way; you become a different person. You grow into it. And you have to work at marriage every day.","Let's be realistic - 90% of superheroes are male. Personally, I prefer Superman, Batman and Spider-Man to Wonder Woman. Not that I don't like female superheroes, but watching male superheroes gives me a high.","I do believe in soulmates and happy/successful marriages. No marriage can be happy 24x7 for 365 days. Both partners have to make the relationship work, is what I believe in.","I sincerely believe that no problem is bigger than man, and problems are blown out of proportion by man himself.","Every parent craves for a child, and once their wishes come true, they feel that it's not possible for them to love anyone more that the first born. But the fact is, after you have the second issue, the feeling is, how can I not love the kid?","I am simply not interested in the pots and pans affair, and neither can I bring myself to be interested in the same. I have such great cooks in the family that I would rather manage the other affairs and leave the kitchen to those who know it best.","If you recognize a face while surfing through 200 channels, you will stop and listen. Celebrities give a positive aura and people like them. Their message appeals to people.","When I was growing up, hand washing was a ritual, but now it's a necessity. A child dies every 15 seconds from preventable causes, which has got to stop.","I'd say working on television is much, much tougher than films. But television has a great connect with a live audience, which is a refreshing change for us actors.","I won't ever direct a film. And I certainly won't write an autobiography. Only self-obsessed people want to write or talk about themselves!","Make that extra effort for every relationship. Whether it's with your parents, your children, your husband or your friends. It makes a difference to them. I try to give my kids a lot of solo time where I play with them, talk to them, listen to them. Similarly, you give time for your workout. You slot a time for it, no matter what.","The best thing you can do for your body is sleep. It's simple. Cater to your body as much as to your mind. Your body, after all, houses your mind. You have to pay attention to your physicality as much as your mentality.","I can understand going for Botox at 45-50, when you want to keep things in place. But I don't understand 25 year olds going for Botox or under the knife. You don't require it. Your skin is fresh, young. Why would you do that to yourself?"],"Kaki King":["We don't really have a place in the universe, as far as on a timeline. But nothing else does, either. Therefore every moment really is the most important moment that's ever happened, including this moment right now.","Tunings are wonderfully inspiring, and it helps you to write music. If I'm stuck, you know, I change the tuning.","Opening acts are hard, really hard. There's more politics involved than music, sometimes.","I try not to punish the audience by making them listen to too much acoustic guitar.","I see people who work on their look and they work on their poster and their website and you know, the music will speak for itself no matter what. So if you put maybe like 95% of your energy on music and 5% on playing out and telling people about it. That's kind of a good equation.","I had to be reminded that the guitar is infinite. It never stops teaching you, it never stops being difficult; there's an unlimited amount of things to learn, and you'll never master it.","The one thing I've always done, because I like the sound of my guitar from where I sit - meaning not in front of it - so what I do is, I put microphones around my ears. I have them around my head, too. I don't know if it's a superstitious thing, but it's actually how I recorded my first album.","I have to say, I do love the Ovation guitars. If I had one guitar to play, it would be that one, and it's got nothing to do with having my name on it. I absolutely rely on it.","I don't remember a time that I didn't know how to play the guitar.","I get why people want to come see me play guitar, but I still don't understand why people want to interview me.","There are a lot of places that I know extremely well. Like, if I were to visit Sydney, Australia, I'd feel very comfortable there. I'm very comfortable in many, many cities.","I write almost every single part of my songs, even the actual drum parts sometimes, whether they be simple or layered with many different instruments.","I've followed the lives of great musicians and have learned that you don't have to always write in pain. You have all of your past experiences, feelings, and thoughts that you can turn on when you need them and turn off when you don't.","I am quite short, but that never comes across when I'm onstage in front of people. When I get offstage and greet an audience afterwards, their first reaction is to comment on my height because it seems like a very drastic difference.","Having been on tour in countries that are extremely eco-friendly, we automatically end up doing the things that normal people do in other countries.","I definitely associate music with color. For example, my first record has a red cover but it is totally green and blue to me.","You get to a point where the kind of beautiful chaos can't really fuel your creative existence any longer because it's not stable, however amazing and exciting it may be."],"Kal Penn":["The point of serving your country is not to do your own thing or to go rogue, but to work as part of the process.","What I love about L.A. and Washington, D.C. is that they're almost the opposite of each other. L.A. is a very creative space while D.C. is a very cerebral space. So, they're the ying and the yang in my world. I like them both for their own reasons.","To the folks walking around the District of Columbia, I would say this: 'Be careful.'","I think the media loves taking the most absurd clips for a sport that has become congressional politics.","The water cooler conversation in every job I've had is sports, it's what did you do this weekend, it's 'How are your parents doing?'","Cable news is more titillating to talk about who's up and who's down and all that nonsense as opposed to what's actually done.","I'm also politically independent so I'm not a fan of either the Democrats in Congress or the Republicans in Congress.","My folks are in Jersey. And I have a lot of friends and other family there. So, I try to visit as much as possible.","In many ways, I feel like having the opportunity to play Gogol in 'The Namesake' really was my dream role in many ways."],"Kaley Cuoco":["I like to be home on a Friday night. I don't go out. I don't go to clubs. It's not my thing. I sit at home with my glass of wine and watch hours of reality TV.","I was having a bad day, and my friend said, 'Go wash your hair.' I thought it was really silly - but it made me feel so much better. It might be a small thing, but it works. Washing it off and starting over.","I wasn't allowed to have sugar as a kid. We didn't have candy or soda or anything, so Easter and Halloween were my favorite times 'cause I could eat as much candy as I wanted.","I've been so lucky and blessed because words and stuff come so easy to me. I have a good memory.","Diet cola is my absolute favorite drink in the world; I used to drink four cans a day. But to help me cut down, I've turned it into a treat. Now, instead of having dessert, I'll have a can of diet soda. Putting a limit on how often I can drink it has helped me appreciate it more.","I'm a 'Bridesmaids' type of girl. I love silliness. That's who I am at heart, and I know I can do it. If my career path takes me elsewhere, that's great. But comedy is my forte.","I don't have a high IQ, but I've always liked nerds and quirky guys.","I love animals, and I feel more of a connection to animals than people.","I'm hoping one day to open my own shelter. I would be the person with the three-legged dog. I just love animals more than people; I really do.","My new iPhone, I'm obsessed. My iPod. I love all the Mac crap. AppleTV, I'm crazy about that. I'd rather buy a new gadget than, like, a purse.","Obviously, I don't have a high IQ, but I've always liked nerds and quirky guys.","I grew up with 'Friends' from day one and, like, 'Seinfeld' and 'Frazier,' those sorts of shows, but for sure, 'Friends' was it for our family. Like, we would watch every Thursday night at eight o'clock; I couldn't wait.","If I played tennis, I had to be in a dance class. I always had multiple activities, so I never had to count on any one of them to feel successful.","I start my day with granola, fresh fruit, and skim milk and end it with something healthy that also comes from my own kitchen.","If my career path takes me elsewhere, that's great. But comedy is my forte.","I only go to yoga to drink wine, so I'm good. I just throw the calories right back in.","Not all of us are chameleons that can do every different thing. I hope I'm going to be typecast. I will play the girl next door for the rest of my life if I have to. I always kind of feel like I have that in my pocket when I go in a room.","John was the smartest and most amazing comedian I've ever worked with. I think more than teaching me about acting or comedy, he taught me about life and the love of people and respect of people.","After everything happened, we all got super tight. I can't deny it. We all just love each other. James Garner and David Spade came on and we fell in love with them too. We've just become a family all over again. We don't want to lose anyone again.","For me, what I really want to come out of it is to show people that I can hold together a movie, be the number one character and play someone who is twenty or twenty-one.","I love the fashion world. I love clothes. I love style.","My whole family actually, but my parents. I had such a normal and amazing childhood. I've been so lucky. My parents are cool and normal. They don't talk about the business and I still have stuff to do at their house.","I will always be the way I was a couple years ago before anything happened. And that's to my parents' credit, my amazing parents who have been around me my whole life and raised me right. I'm very happy with what has happened so far.","Finally there was a moment when it just hit me. John wouldn't want me to sit on my butt for the rest of my life feeling sorry for myself or sorry for him. As cheesy as it sounds, he would have wanted us to go on.","The final phone call that said we're going to be picked up again was just a miracle. We've overcome the impossible and we're still pushing forward. I know John is smiling and so happy that he gets to watch us on TV.","James Garner is like a peaceful river through our chaos.","People tend to think they know you when you come into their televisions every week. They think you are different than who you are. Don't believe everything you hear.","I love all music. Right now I am loving Josh Grobin and Kelly Clarkson.","You do a job; your show gets canceled. You get used to it.","Horseback riding is my passion. Other than work. People can't imagine me getting dirty, but that's what I love about it.","I don't want to be involved with an actor because I know how they are. I've had problems in the past being with guys who haven't had any success or haven't made as much money, and it's very uncomfortable.","I was always very silly and never took myself seriously. When my father had the camera out, I'd be up close and annoying. My father would keep saying, 'Move back! Move back!'","It's a fine line of doing what's good for your life and what your parents want you to do, but also following your dreams. With my parents, when I was younger, I always had to do two things. If I was acting, I always had to do a sport or something on the arts side of things along with that.","My mom grew up with horses, and when I turned 14, 15, she's like, 'Do you want to take a riding lesson?' I thought, 'Oh, gross, dirty.' She was like, 'Okay.' And then I did, and now I'm the one cleaning those damn stalls out. You can't get me away from the barn now. It shocks even me.","'Big Bang' is unbelievable; I'm blessed, but it's not the only thing in my life.","I start the day with oatmeal with vanilla almond milk. If I don't, I'm dying by noon and eating everything in sight. On-set, I avoid crap and pack soup and salad. I cook pork chops or turkey tacos for dinner.","When I started on 'Big Bang,' I was the only girl; I felt like I had four brothers. Then Melissa Rauch and Mayim Bialik came on the show, and we got really close. Because of that, I'm not so quick to judge other women, and now I have all these amazing new girlfriends.","Unless you're Gisele, you wake up some days and feel ugly. When that happens, I accept that I'm not perfect and it's OK; I can start over again tomorrow.","I cry all the time. I love to laugh, too. It's important to create an environment for yourself where you feel what you need to and don't hold it in.","I did a movie called 'Quicksand No Escape' with Donald Sutherland and Tim Matheson. I think I was maybe 5. I was really little. Yeah, it was fun. And actually, Felicity Huffman played my mom.","When I fell for Johnny Galecki, we both knew immediately that we had this connection, and that was it.","I'm a good eater and like to make my own meals. I start my day with granola, fresh fruit, and skim milk and end it with something healthy that also comes from my own kitchen.","A 'Cosmo' cover has been my dream my entire life. I cried when I found out.","I feel like a lot of comedians do have that deep, dark thing. I have my stuff, but I don't go to that dark place.","Acting was just another part of my life, as it still is today. It's 1 of the 10 things I love doing. It's never just been my life. As cheesy as it sounds, all my eggs were never in just one basket. I had a thousand baskets going on.","I really am an open book. I don't keep anything in at all, which is good and bad.","I feel like I'm meant to be a mom.","I've fallen victim to worrying about what everybody thinks. It's never going to be that everyone is happy. You just gotta know what you like and go with it.","I have four horses, and they are my everything.","I've grown up on TV, and there were some phases that weren't pretty.","I wouldn't say I was bullied, but I was definitely a bit of an outcast. It was more the kids thinking I thought I was cool. I started homeschooling in fifth grade, and I was much happier.","I'm the most competitive person you'll ever meet.","I had such a normal and amazing childhood. I've been so lucky. My parents are cool and normal. They don't talk about the business, and I still have stuff to do at their house.","I'm a country girl at heart.","I think an old-school Western would kind of be really up my alley and would be so fun, I'm so comfortable in that genre and around horses.","It took years for me to figure out what my body needs and that what works for my friends doesn't necessarily work for me. Doing yoga five times a week has transformed my body.","I love being toned and having muscle; it's so sexy and beautiful. And I owe it 100 percent to yoga.","I'm the type of girl who's always had to buy jeans in three sizes because I never know what my body is going to do from one day to the next.","I have to have a cheat day. I know when I'm being good all week long that come Sunday, I'm going to lie by the pool, have a drink, and eat some pizza.","My parents spent 16 years hauling my butt to L.A. for audition after audition. I remember always hoping I could help take care of them because they took such good care of me.","I know a lot of the work that paved the way for women happened before I was around... I was never that feminist girl demanding equality, but maybe that's because I've never really faced inequality.","I know it sounds old-fashioned, but I like the idea of women taking care of their men.","I feel like a lot of comedians do have that deep, dark thing. I have my stuff, but I don't go to that dark place. Things are just way too good.","As cheesy as it sounds, all my eggs were never in just one basket. I had a thousand baskets going on.","It's important in a relationship to have moments when you do your own thing.","Staying fit is all about trying to find enjoyment in something physical, because that's the only way you're gonna get results.","I don't go out. I don't go to clubs. It's not my thing. I sit at home with my glass of wine and watch hours of reality TV. I have a million shows on my TiVo.","I'm not a girly girl. I go to the bar. I like to get dirty. I love sports. I'm like the son my dad never had.","I can be a guy's guy and go to a game. But at the end of the night, I can still get dressed up for a date. There are a million different personalities that are part of me.","I don't have kids, but I know that you want them to follow their dreams, while at the same time, you don't want them to be sitting around, hoping that dream is just going to come. I'm sure that's hard to tell your kids.","With my parents, when I was younger, I always had to do two things. If I was acting, I always had to do a sport or something on the arts side of things along with that. That way, if one fell apart, I always had something else to fall back on.","At the end of the day, I do think I'm happiest doing comedy. I love it. I know that I can do other things. I love drama as well.","As I've gotten older, I've had to change my food intake.","I love classical. I have a lot of, like, Bach and Mozart and stuff. Then you flip on over, and I've got, like, Kanye West and, you know, just a bunch of - I am very eclectic. I love every sort of music.","I guess I've dated smart guys, I've dated dumb guys, hot guys.","I want to be the first person to laugh at myself. It makes other people feel at ease - we're all on an even playing field.","The problem with being married to an athlete who is, like, 19 feet tall and can just eat, like, 17 burgers at 11 o'clock at night is, you're like, 'I'll have just three of those burgers,' and you think you're being good because he had 19 and you had three!","I firmly believe, only because I've been doing this for so long, every show takes three years. 90% of them don't get three years. It just does. It takes a long time to build a community, build a friendship with your characters. It's hard for people to grasp on and make them care about you.","I actually like to sing on 'Rock Band.' I prefer to take the mic.","A while ago, I was starting to get bored with my routine, so I tried Spinning and fell in love with it instantly. I go to class three times a week, without fail. I always get there early so I can sit in the front of the studio, and I'm ready to go as soon as the instructor comes in.","I think we all have different moods - a nerd one day and cool the next. I think everyone has an inner geek, and I know I definitely do.","I've been acting since I was 5, literally since I could walk, and I've always said, 'I think one day I have to be in a fat suit.'","I've never been in an acting class in my life.","I hate the sound of my voice. I can hear it from a mile away - it's nasally. Why do I talk like that? It freaks me out!","I wonder, 'Why did I do that line that way?' And I also constantly think I'm fat and hate my teeth. But I've gotten better over the years. I've started to accept.","When I moved in, I said, 'I don't care how this makes me look or sound: I am converting one of these bedrooms into a shoe closet.' It's become more of a dressing room, but one wall is shoes in their perfect cubbies.","I have five horses. My first was a professional jumper named Santos. I got him when I was 18.","I was 16 when I auditioned for the series '8 Simple Rules.' They cast the kids first.","My family lived in Thousand Oaks. In 2002, when I was 17, I begged my parents to let me move out. I had money, a real job, and wanted to get my own place.","My 'Big Bang Theory' costar Johnny Galecki went off the grid. He bought a huge ranch and goes there every weekend. He keeps telling me to do the same thing, but I don't know if I'm that committed. The Valley is as far off the grid as I'm going to go.","I like Penny. She's cool. Yeah, she dates some idiots, but, although, so have I. So yeah, I would be friends with her. We'd have a lot to talk about.","I love when guys are funny. I love guys that are funny and goofy and over the top. And you know, I really like personality. I do.","I would have 55 dogs if I could. I'm hoping one day to open my own shelter.","James Garner was a gift to our business and an example of honesty and pure class. It was an honor to have worked beside him and receive his bear hugs every day.","I'm a country girl at heart. I think an old-school Western would kind of be really up my alley and would be so fun. I'm so comfortable in that genre and around horses.","I know how to stand up for myself. I say no when I want to, yes when I want to, and no one can really change my mind.","For me to be with someone, he's got to be fit. Or at least doing something he loves. Following your passion - whether it's hiking or sports or whatever - is super sexy.","I bleed feminism. I get equal pay to my male costars on a big show; I have my own home. I'm as independent as you could possibly be.","I really don't have a type. I never had a type. If I could put them all together, it's, like, the most different grouping. So I love when guys are funny. I love guys that are funny and goofy and over the top. And you know, I really like personality.","I love the studio audience. That's where I feel the most at home. You know right away if you're being funny or not.","It's hard to tell what an entire series is going to be based on the first few episodes, or even on the first season. And it's sad because you see great casts and good ideas that don't get that opportunity to grow and show what it could turn into.","I've learned after so many years in this business that nothing is set in stone until you're on set. I've been told I was the choice for years and never got hired. So I never go there in my mind.","People tend to think they know you when you come into their televisions every week."],"Kali Hawk":["Training is vital. You need to know the technical aspects of acting, just in case someone hands you a monologue and simply says, 'Cry here and laugh here.' You have to be able to make sense of it all.","I guess every character has a little bit of the actor - I guess for every character you play, the actor has to allow a little bit of their own character to show through.","A lot of times people hide their quirks when they're first getting to know a person.","I think that's what the most fascinating part of getting to know someone is - to see how they do things, and how their way of doing things is different from your way of doing things, and the fun of trying to do it their way and to see what value there is in looking at things from their perspective.","I guess I'm lucky that I've been able to play a wide range of parts and a wide range of types of productions - I haven't felt much typecasting."],"Kallam Anji Reddy":["Everyone has a purpose in life and a unique talent to give to others. And when we blend this unique talent with service to others, we experience the ecstasy and exultation of own spirit, which is the ultimate goal of all goals.","We must show there is good in society. If you read the newspapers, you think there are only crooks in this world, but that's not true.","We earned our dollars in a hard way;, nobody gave us a feast or gave it on a plate. We worked hard and we have innovated; we have made things in a better way at a cheaper rate and gave it to the people of India.","To start with, pharma was an industry based on innovation, drug discovery.","My father used to administer herbal medicine for free. But I can't give drugs for free. So the next best thing is to give it at as low a price as possible.","I want to see one of my products being taken by people across the world. I want to see them improving and leading a better life. It's like playing God.","This is my life... I mean, maybe I have Rs 100 crore in the bank, sitting comfortably. If that increases to Rs 10,000 crore, what difference does it make to me.","I had seen a Pfizer's pilot plant in 1965 and decided that, 'I'll build a Pfizer.'

May you have the vision to find it, the courage to get on to it, and the perseverance to follow it.","There are so many people who are arguing or fighting over issues which don't have much relevance. We must all realise it is not worth it. It's like being in the whirlpools which are always present behind a little rock near a river. We seem to be living in these little whirlpools and forget that there is a whole river. The picture is much bigger.","When you look at the stars and the galaxy, you feel that you are not just from any particular piece of land, but from the solar system.","Listen to the sounds of nature. Wishing you the best on your trek towards your dreams.","The journey matters as much as the goal.","Do something because you really want to do it. If you're doing it just for the goal and don't enjoy the path, then I think you're cheating yourself.","You must enjoy the journey because whether or not you get there, you must have fun on the way.","We gazed dreamily at the Milky Way and once in a while caught some shooting stars. Times like those gave me the opportunity to wonder and ask all those very basic questions. That sense of awe for the heavens started there.","There are so many people who are arguing or fighting over issues which don't have much relevance. We must all realise it is not worth it.","I would say if you have a dream, follow it. It doesn't really matter whether you are a woman or from India or from wherever.","The first view of the Earth is magical. It is a very overpowering realization that the Earth is so small. It affected me. I could not get over the notion that in such a small planet, with such a small ribbon of life, so much goes on. It is as if the whole place is sacred.","The first view of the Earth is magical... in such a small planet, with such a small ribbon of life, so much goes on. It is as if the whole place is sacred. You get the feeling that I need to work extraordinarily hard along with other human beings to respect that.","It is a very overpowering realization that the Earth is so small. It affected me.","I stopped thinking about it after trying to figure out what are the lessons learned, and there are so many. After I had basically sorted that out, I figured it's time to really look at the future and not at the past.","The list of what I want to do is so long, I would need a few lifetimes to achieve them. For instance, I would like to fly small planes, maybe over the Ganges one day.","When you lift off, the pressure is supposed to be maximum. But actually, it was very benign. Very enjoyable. But as soon as the engines cut off and you get to zero gravity, you felt as if you were being pushed off your seat. You feel disoriented. You don't feel aligned with anything. I felt for a few good hours that I was falling.","In summers, while growing up in India, we often slept in the courtyard under the stars.","I have felt that connection and stewardship for Earth for as long as I can remember. And not just for Earth, but the whole universe.","Take good care of our fragile planet.","I don't know why I always liked aerospace engineering. I was in the 10th grade when I figured that's what I wanted to do.","The quickest way may not necessarily be the best.","It's like running a marathon race. We train all hours of the day. When you are taking a bath, you are thinking of the flight.","You are just your intelligence.","If you want to do something, what does it matter where you are ranked?","I was interested in aerospace and flying, and the U.S. is really the best place in the world for flying.","Material interests are not the only guiding light.","I've always been very determined. I don't get easily discouraged.","Some of the senior people, the very senior astronauts, shook my hand and said, 'K.C., you did a great job. Don't let anyone tell you different.'","Every once in a while, we'd ask my dad if we could get a ride in one of these planes. And, he did take us to the flying club and get us a ride in the Pushpak and a glider that the flying club had.","It's easy for me to be motivated and inspired by seeing somebody who just goes all out to do something.","We crossed the Himalayas in less than two minutes, and then you realise, 'Oh My God, within an hour and a half, we have gone around the whole planet.'","I am from Karnal, India."],"Kamal Ahmed":["Ah, the pleasure, the joy - a big news story that runs and runs, that is played down by some of our journalistic colleagues, saying 'it'll never happen', only to be confirmed by the Home Secretary.","As we saw in the Queen's Speech, anti-social behaviour - a phenomenon that I believe to be a genuine worry that is also being fed by a lot of scare stories - is the political theme of the moment.","Of, course it always cheers a news editor when a story has what we describe as 'legs' therefore it, erm, runs."],"Kamal Haasan":["When you don't take a stand against corruption you tacitly support it.","Acceptance is the only thing you should teach. Be it Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Dalit, you must inculcate acceptance, not tolerance.","Even if the country is run by a Mussolini, free speech will find its way.","I am very angry, and you don't need angry politicians. You need politicians with great balance.","Tell me, when do you become a respectable person in society? When you start respecting yourself. That is when you take care of yourself, that is when you comb your hair, groom yourself, and cleanse your body. You do all this because you respect yourself.","You must have anger, as rightful wrath is what makes you create your own ethical standards.","The fact that I've lived this long is not really an achievement. Time passes; we age... it's natural. This is why it annoys me when a person watches a movie and tells me that it was 'time pass.' Would time not have passed if he hadn't watched the film?","Happiness is perhaps painlessness, a state one rarely appreciates. Happiness, then, is very much like a great talent. It rarely gets appreciated and is taken for granted.","I'd like to keep updating myself. That's the only way to make life interesting. And because I am a performer, I like to do it deliberately and with purpose.","I don't remember myself to be a forefront fighter, but when pushed to a point with a wall behind me, there is only one way forward.

I've been a fan of certain communist and socialist ideals. Some have failed, some have succeeded. I've lived long enough to understand where all they failed.","I've always believed in speaking my mind, and I think the technology has made it more prominent. Even a common man's voice is heard prominently now, much to the chagrin and surprise of politicians. They aren't used to that.","The creation of God itself, I deduced, came from our primal fear.","The disgraces I suffer should be attributed to me, but the praises that I get go to my family and teachers. It is they who decided what I would become.","When I was 16, I felt I might be left with some effeminacy because of all the dancing. I was so full of classical dance that I wanted to get away and do something else.","The box office is a black money laundry shop. No business is straight.","We are not exercising our democratic rights properly. We need to stop looking for solutions in others.","I have been vociferous against government on things like beef. I used to eat beef, but I've stopped. That doesn't mean others shouldn't eat beef.","If reality TV is bad, so is Colosseum, so are the gladiators, so are sports. I think cricket is bad. But that's a point of view.","All my films are statements, especially when I write them.","I cannot live on myths; somehow, science convinces me more easily. I am prone to lean towards science, ethics, and philosophy rather than myth, religion, and rituals.","Politics is too big a game to feel the absence of a Kamal Haasan.","If it doesn't reach the last poor man, your constitution is wrong.","Since I was 20, I wanted to make a short film and send it to international short film festivals. It never happened. I became too big a star to indulge in those things.","As a principle, I will never react to film criticisms. As long as they are part of film fraternity, whatever they say will be beneficial to cinema.","Entering politics would be like donning a crown of thorns.","I don't have tiffs with people. I only mind my business, but whatever interferes my freedom of expression, I have always voiced.","I've entered politics the moment I marked my finger with the electoral voting mark. So I've entered politics, but I am not a politician. I am doing my duty as a citizen of India.","Acting ceases to be work because I enjoy it. But it feels like working when I do bad work, especially when I know it is bad.","You have to appreciate the finer points of your work; criticise, too, if needed. I am also my own worst and most honest critic. I can say things which nobody will ever dare say. Even the best of friends will stop at a point, whereas I can go beyond.","Once you attain stardom, you lose that finer touch with society. When you are a man on the street, you get to know every vibration. But once you attain this status, more than you, people become self-conscious by your presence.","Sometimes we equate anger to destructive physical violence, but anger need not be martial.","I am not the opposite of theism. I am right in the middle of those non-believers and believers. It's not even about being agnostic or nastik. Why would I take a name given to me by my opposition? I am just a rationalist.","The most feared thing should be death, but after a lot of rumination, I have settled to fear incessant pain. It is not a 'screaming hysterically' kind of fear but a silently lurking one.","I used to be a wannabe Genghis Khan and will always be that. He never lost any battles. Then I swung to the other side of the spectrum and settled on Mr. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. Now I realise I should identify myself with those who strengthen my argument.","If I were to believe in the stories of the of the gods, then the gods do not need mortals to defend them, do they?","I love reading all the mythological stories. I was brought up on them.","We got to go one step further than even 'Make in India.' Let's make India itself - India 2.0, the updated version.","I am opposed to autobiographies, mainly because most autobiographies lie.","When classical singers or dancers look at cinema with derision, I have half a heart to tell them that they're wrong. They're losing a platform.","A political party is about an ideology. And I don't think my goals in politics can match the ideology of any political party.","Would I get into politics? I'll just say what I tell people when they ask me this: Pray that everyday citizens like me aren't pushed to that corner.","I write the occasional poem. I think my dabbling in poetry makes me better at screenplays. Poetry teaches the value of condensing, the importance of talking in a few words.","People keep saying Balachander discovered me. I differ. He invented me. When a stalwart like him suggests that I act in films, who am I to refuse?","All stars are businessmen. Once you decide to become a star, you are talking about money, fame, and being successful.","If you ask my opinion, I don't look at a film according to its box office collection.","I audition for almost every role. I get into auditions even when I am just producing a film. Not that someone would fire me, but I keep trying various tests and keep working till I learn the job.","There is a lot to be learnt, and I am always dissatisfied. I am happy but not content.","If my idol Mahatma Gandhi could fight to eradicate corruption at the age of 78, why can't I try at 60?","We should work towards a legislation to sack non-performing politicians. This may not happen during my lifetime, but I will try for it anyway."],"Kamala Harris":["I was raised to be an independent woman, not the victim of anything.","The American dream belongs to all of us.","What's important for my daughter to know is that... if you are fortunate to have opportunity, it is your duty to make sure other people have those opportunities as well.","I'm a career prosecutor. I have been trained, and my experience over decades, is to make decisions after a review of the evidence and the facts. And not to jump up with grand gestures before I've done that. Some might interpret that as being cautious. I would tell you that's just responsible.","I believe that a child going without an education is a crime.","We need to incorporate that age-old concept of redemption into the work that we do in the criminal justice system in California.","These days, children can text on their cell phone all night long, and no one else is seeing that phone. You don't know who is calling that child.","My mother had a saying: 'Kamala, you may be the first to do many things, but make sure you're not the last.'","What we all want is public safety. We don't want rhetoric that's framed through ideology.","To change criminal justice policy in any meaningful way means to propose changing a very longstanding system. It's not realistic to think you can do it overnight.","You have to see and smell and feel the circumstances of people to really understand them.","Generally speaking, the public appetite for criminal justice policy is just tough talk.","My mother was and will always remain my greatest hero.","I believe you've got to do your due diligence.","Everybody will make mistakes, and for some that mistake will rise to the level of being a crime.","I always start my campaigns early, and I run hard. Maybe it comes from the rough-and-tumble world of San Francisco politics, where it's not even a contact sport - it's a blood sport. This is how I am as a candidate. This is how I run campaigns.","I convened the first-ever national training conference for prosecutors on how to promote and deal with hate crime issues in terms of prosecutions and also protocol for defeating the gay panic defense.","We don't want to promote any system that treats the fact that an individual is LGBT as a personality disorder. And anything that perpetuates that perception is harmful - not only to that member of the community but the entire community.","So many people trip in front of them because they're looking over there or up ahead.","Doing nothing while the middle class is hurting. That's not leadership. Loose regulations and lax enforcement. That's not leadership. That's abandoning our middle class.","I remember when my mother, Shyamala Harris, bought our first home. I was thirteen. She was so proud, and my sister and I were so excited. Millions of Americans know that feeling of walking through the front door of their own home for the first time - the feeling of reaching for opportunity and finding it.","With the advent of DNA, we know that people have been convicted and sentenced to death who later proved not to be guilty of the crime.","I'll be judged on the body of work and not the popularity of any one decision.","I think Hillary Clinton could do whatever she puts her mind to. I really do. She's incredibly dedicated to public service, she is smart as a whip, and she's effective.","The bells will ring and the marriages will begin. And it's a great day in our state for equal protection under the law for all people.","We're talking about in the Proposition 8 case fundamental rights, civil rights. I offer no apology for the position I took in Prop. 8.","I want to use my position of leadership to help move along at a faster pace what I believe and know the Obama administration wants to do around the urgency of climate change.","I've had the good fortune and blessing to run for the offices for which I really wanted to do the work.","I'm one of the luckiest people on earth.","My parents met when they were graduate students at UC Berkeley in the 1960s. They were both active in the civil-rights movement.","People who work for me know that family comes first. And I'm fortunate to have a family that is very supportive of the work I do, so I don't have to live two separate lives.","I have loved to cook since I was a child in my mother's kitchen. If I don't have time to cook, I'll just read a cookbook.","I love being in a courtroom.","I think I have every piece of music Bob Marley ever made.","'Getting smart on crime' does not mean reducing sentences or punishments for crimes.","I strongly believe that for serious and violent criminals, we must absolutely hold them accountable for their crimes and send them to prison.","Running for office is similar to being a trial lawyer in a very long trial. It requires adrenaline and stamina; it requires being in shape mentally and emotionally. It's a marathon.","I have a difficult time sitting down for long periods.","Every day there are homeowners in California who will either receive relief so they can stay in their home, or will be in the foreclosure process and potentially lose their home. And that always weighed heavily on my mind.","We don't have to guess what Mitt Romney would have done if he were president. Because he told us. He said we should let foreclosures - and I quote - 'hit the bottom' so the market could - I quote - 'run its course.'","Mitt Romney subscribes to the cynical logic that says the American dream belongs to some of us but not all of us.","To be smart on crime, we should not be in a position of constantly reacting to crime after it happens. We should be looking at preventing crime before it happens.","What we know is smartphones are everywhere and they are rich in data. What we know is that there are apps once downloaded by the consumer that will also in turn download the consumers' contact book. Most consumers don't want that to happen and don't know it's happening.","In California, we have some of the strongest consumer protection laws in the country. While it is easy to conceive of innovation and regulation as mutually exclusive, California is proof that we can do both. We can innovate responsibly.","I believe in that old adage that 'as goes California, so goes the country.'"],"Kami Garcia":["As much as I love to dive into the action early, I think the hero's journey is important - the idea that the reader needs to experience the protagonist's everyday life before you turn that world upside down.","The beginning of a book is always the hardest part for me. I'm a Chapter 3 kind of writer, which means I naturally start at Chapter 3.","I start with a beat sheet, which is more of an abbreviated outline. It hits all the major plot points. From there, I move to note cards. But the most important part of my process is my inspiration board.","At the beginning of a new project, often before I do any actual writing, I collect photos, quotes, song lyrics, and even objects that relate to the characters or the world I'm creating.","I was a fine arts major in college, and a painter for many years. And I found that, like writing, art is very similar."],"Kamisese Mara":["The family teaches us about the importance of knowledge, education, hard work and effort. It teaches us about enjoying ourselves, having fun, keeping fit and healthy.","I have been sustained by cane field, the cane plantation I have.","He said there is 80 of us, ready to come down and the next thing I knew is that Jo Brown dashed in and said your family has already moved and you have to move, the boat is ready to take you out. I didn't have time to ask, even ask a question.","I received my money from the treasury, I used to very early to go the clubs, but when the burden of looking after my children came upon me I tried to live a quite life, and save as much as I could.","The first money I have been offered was as District Officer Ba.","I have never been bribed as a Prime Minister.","I was the deputy Chairman of the Democratic Union of the Pacific, and we started at 8 I think and I was called to the telephone and to be told there's a coup, the government has been overthrown - it was round about 9, 10 when the Parliament sat they had done then.","I thought they know that I was the Commander in Chief, not that I know that I am the Commander in Chief, and they should behave; know how to behave to the Commander in Chief.","And I said, yes, if you think that I avoid bloodshed by standing aside, then I will stand aside.","Whom am I going to trust if I have to back again.","How could I stand by and watch my house on fire?","It is with obedience to your call that I take up the burden of government leadership for the final time.","I suspect the psychological pressure associated with that crisis caused the first mental blackout I had ever suffered. It contributed to a deterioration in my health that later required the insertion of a heart pacemaker.","Fiji had experienced the ordeal of two military coups.","Even institutions of State, such as the judiciary, were seriously weakened, to the extent that the citizenry justifiably feared a breakdown in law and order. The business community was hit by a slump in sales and confidence, leading to reduced earnings and loss of jobs.","It is from the traditional family that we absorb those universal ideals and principles which are the teaching of Jesus, the bedrock of our religious faith. We are taught the difference between right and wrong, and about the law, just punishment and discipline.","If the constitution goes, I go.","In a multi-racial society, trust, understanding and tolerance are the cornerstones of peace and order."],"Kamla Persad-Bissessar":["We have seven pillars of development. India has a cutting edge information technology industry. We are setting up a technology park. We would like to see technology penetration iin education. Besides, we would like to see cooperation in industries like fashion, filmmaking, ship-building, education, health and energy.","Today is indeed an historic occasion when as a first chair-in-office woman I hand over to another woman chair in office, your Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, in the presence of a woman head of the Commonwealth, Her Royal Highness, Her Majesty the Queen of England.","As a woman, my style defines my leadership. It's a gentler, more compassionate approach. I consult, I listen and I compromise where it's in the best interest of the citizens.","As a child in the rural district of Penal I remember sharing meals from the same pot with neighbours of different racial, ethnic, social and economic backgrounds.","We need to rekindle those values, those strengths as a nation and as a people... And we must do so as one people with one goal.","Looking towards the future, one of the most important issues the national community must face is the widening gap between the liberated, modern, independent women and our traditional men who are being left behind.","Women are outperforming men in almost every sphere of life in our society and the women of East Indian ancestry are no exception to this rule. They have broken the cultural mould.","There are lot memories to take home but the most emotional moment has been when I was touching down in New Delhi. Tears rolled down when I saw the red soil in Delhi from the plane.","When I was travelling in Rajasthan people were waving hands, and it felt like I was visiting my own constituency.","My son is not that emotional. He thought my trip to India is just another conference, But when he hearing about my visit on TV, he too got moved.","One of my officers said to me that Trinidad and Tobago is seen like an ATM card... you come in with the card and you come back out with cash. It cannot happen anymore. It just cannot happen.","Global governance cannot be limited to the crafting of instruments related to the promotion of democracy. A key component must be the creation of fair and equitable rules to enhance the development prospects of developing countries."],"Kandyse McClure":["I read that when cats are cuddling and kneading you, and you think it's cute, they're really just checking your vitals for weak spots.","I have to say, as a young woman of color, and this may sound controversial, in sci-fi, anything is possible. In sci-fi I can belong to the military. In sci-fi I can have an interracial love affair; I can be a revolutionary.","I'd love a werebear. But I guess you need that seductive element of danger. And though bears can be dangerous, when you say werebear it just sounds kind of cuddly. Probably has a rainbow on his belly.","I've always loved the power of stories to transport me to another world, to imagine extraordinary possibilities, to experience things I may not have access to in my regular life - like being a superhero! Also, I would always put on shows for my family and the neighbors; I guess I was an actor before I even knew it.","I lived in South Africa until I was 11 when we first immigrated. My mom had sent me back there when I was 14 for summer vacation. I wasn't doing very well in school, my grades were slipping. I called my mom one day and told her that I wasn't coming back. I ended up staying there until I was 17 before coming back to North America.","This is going to sound pretentious and esoteric, but I truly mean it from the bottom of my heart. Acting has always been a spiritual journey for me. The very first project I ever acted on paralleled my experience so perfectly even before I was aware of it.","Living here in North America - I have been Americanized. When I go back home now, there are things that I have far less tolerance for in South Africa. We've come such a long way in terms of race relations and the economy as well as people's willingness to move on. There are still a lot of things that are frustrating about being in South Africa.","The very first role I ever played was as a 17-year old South African girl who dreamed of being a star and left home to meet her mother in the big city so that she could pursue that dream. I left South Africa and met my mother in Vancouver and not long after that was given the opportunity to perform on the stage and have people chant my name.","Candice is the original spelling of my name. I changed it to Kandyse when I was really young and first starting out in the business as kind of a joke. I didn't realize it would stick! I did consider changing it, but then it seemed too confusing, so then I asked them to change it back. Not too soon, however!","I'm always preparing for a regular life."],"Kangana Ranaut":["Freedom of being alone is intoxicating.","Success is the best revenge. I always feel women should answer back either with their sarcasm or success.","I am naturally slim, actually thin. So, for years I have been trying to get some curves. I tried eating food that would increase my weight, but I only ended up putting fat around my stomach. So, now I have made peace with my body.","Modesty is good. But not when it comes at the cost of honesty.","I don't find it humiliating when they call me a psychopath or witch.","I would never be able to spend all my life in a busy city like Mumbai.","I am extremely proud of my rags-to-riches story. It's fun to be a misfit or an underdog if you acknowledge your gifts and befriend your obstacles.","I don't find anything upsetting or gross or degrading about fighting with a mental illness: Bipolar or Schizophrenia.","Going vegetarian - and then vegan - has calmed me down, and it has also made me physically and emotionally strong. I do crave meat once in a while, but I find that spiritually, non-vegetarian food works against my emotional health.","Women empowerment does not mean you create complex among men. Then it will take 20 more years to empower men. It is all about evolving as a soul, as a human being. It does not mean that you become a sexist.","Physically, it is very demanding as an actor, and I don't want to put a lot of focus on that, but I think it is emotionally and mentally a lot more... It can completely twist you... We abandon ourselves for days and months, and by the end of it, we are twisted people which you make fun of.","I don't seek validation outside, not even with the audience. Today they like me, but tomorrow they may hate me. I don't want to be anybody's role model.","Item numbers are not my cup of tea.","Tone matters more than words.","Why should Bollywood accept me? I should accept Bollywood. I don't care if Bollywood has accepted me. I don't seek acceptance. I don't need to live up to anybody's expectations.","When I moved to Bombay, it was very harsh. I was nothing like what I am today. I couldn't speak a word of English. In England, people might be very understanding about that, but in Bombay, they're not very forgiving. 'If you don't speak English, how do you expect to work in Hindi films?'","Ever since I was a child, I would start crying seeing anyone in pain.","My man has to be more intelligent than I am, which is difficult to find. He should definitely be more successful than me, which is not so difficult to find. I'd be a fool to expect a better looking man than me, which is impossible to find.","Imagine: in the medieval ages, there was no evidence of how the history of mankind has been affected by witchcraft. But there is significant factual history of how brutality and sadism of mankind have been displayed in the most obscene manner in the name of witch-hunt.","I am a very proud Hindu. The foundation of my personality is laid on the teachings of Swami Vivekananda or Sanatan Dharm or the Geeta. And if my religious practices or anybody's religious practices is given any kind of sadistic name, it instills fear about other person's religious practices.","In India, it's a matter of fact that a girl child is seen as a liability. Probably the only expectation is that you grow up to a presentable young woman who can get a decent spouse.","All beautiful things in this world are because of women.","I need nothing from my companion. No money, no financial security, no emotional support, nothing. All I want is the freedom to be myself.","I don't know if it is of any joy to humiliate people. No matter what, whether you're high in life or low in life, humiliation and such kinds of things should just be ignored. I don't derive any pleasure from running people down.","When I left my home to become an actress, my father didn't give me a single penny. I struggled a lot, and they had no idea what I went through. My grandfather even asked me to drop my surname when he learnt I was joining films.","I followed my instincts; I followed my intuition, and it paid off.","A lot of my friends are getting married, but I don't think that is what I need. I am under no such pressure that if everybody is having a boyfriend, I too should have one.","In my film 'Queen', there was a funny moment with the bra. My director called and said they are blurring the bra. They said it is vulgar. Our director was furious about it. We are artistes... We see props as they are. A woman's bra is not a danger to the society.","Money can't buy everything, but it can buy most of it. Because of money, I could give my parents a comfortable life.","Our society loves raw character; we love raw women. We don't love our mother because she is hot and sexy: we love our mother because she is our mother. We love our granny because she is our granny. We value her. We don't remember anyone's face from our childhood; we love our granny's face.","I am not comfortable walking the ramp for just any designer. I am particular about who I associate with.","I think there are things that you look for when you're younger, and you think they are going to make you happier or make you feel complete. That's not going to happen, and it's really about living the moments. Eventually, you reach a point when you're at ease with your life and don't have any unrealistic expectations.","In metros, girls are very independent, conscious and aware. But in the interiors of our country, where education is not given importance, they continue to be oppressed. But it is important for every woman to acknowledge what she wants from herself rather than going for what people expect from her.","From my side, there was no acceptance to this fact that I am any less than anyone around me. So there was a certain discomfort that I felt growing up that I am not seen as I want to be seen as.","Even after 'Gangster' being a success, I was considered a B-grade actress and was a sidekick, even though I was good at what I did, and was jobless for two years.","My parents wanted me to be a doctor. So I took up science, but then realised that my heart was not in it at all. The thought of treating ailing people was very depressing.","I always wanted to be the person to whom people looked forward to give opportunities. As opposed to always being the person who wants to work with others and who is always the backup: where it's like, 'If nothing works out then OK, let's get this person.'","If a woman is super-successful, she is called a psychopath.","What people see is just your career graph and the films you do. But that's a very small aspect of my life.","Nobody was my support. You have to support yourself, and I think that is the beauty of being a woman. You can handle anything and be ten times better than men.","My parents gave me the easy option that if you're going to go your way, that's the highway. You can expect no funds and no support, which I think was legitimate; that was a fair option.","When I did these psychological characters like the drug addicts, the ones who were rejected and dejected, I started to feel a sort of melancholia which was very unnatural for me to have at a teenage. Then I avoided those characters.","At 18, I wanted to work with the creme de la creme because I thought that was the only way to be successful. But I don't think any A-lister has done as many B-grade films as I have.","I don't know why everyone feels the pressure to look young. Personally, I hate it. I don't want to inject Botox and look young forever. It's living in denial and anything that has an undercurrent of this philosophy is bad for your growth.","Sometimes films might not work, but you as an actor should keep working. Because no matter how much you panic about how your film didn't work, eventually, when you step out in the real world, there are people who value you as an artist.","Relationships can be very traumatic. But being in a healthy relationship can be very empowering.","I write poems, I meditate. I don't live up to people's expectations. I don't do the conventional cool things - I know I am the coolest person.","It's very hard to live in an environment where you're reminded, constantly told that your existence just happens to be here... That you are not meant to be here.","I schooled in Himachal Pradesh. I had taken up science and, initially, wanted to become a doctor. There are few career options for students of science though, so I shifted to Delhi and decided to try theater instead.","I come from a middle class family, and my parents weren't too supportive of my career choices.","My father is a businessman, and my mother is a schoolteacher.","My biggest asset is that I know how to learn, and that, I believe, will help me in the long run.","My ancestors are Rajputs from Jaipur, a lineage of the royal family.","I cannot approach someone; I lack the confidence when it comes to the guy I desire. I'm very good when it comes to matchmaking and hooking others up. But I can't help my own cause.","I come from Surajpur, a valley in Himachal Pradesh near Manali that is named after my great grandfather Sarju Singh Ranaut.","I had no work after 'Gangster' for two years, and my sister Rangoli met with an accident that destroyed her looks. My struggle with my parents combined with the industry not accepting me made me feel alienated.","If you work with big stars, then they become the lead actors. It's not that I don't want to do films with big stars, but I would rather do the films where I get the title roles.","I was very insecure at the beginning of my career. I didn't value my talent. I would have probably skipped signing up for movies that I didn't want to do if I had understood that I had been accepted and people liked my work.","The thing about Bollywood is that you can't just quit it even if you have little fame. You have to stick around and keep trying.","For me, to be in a place where I'm on the 'favourite' list of top directors I like, that's being number one. There is no other definition to me. It's not money; it's not how many songs you're seen in or how many clothes you're changing in the film.","Hits and flops are overrated.","I want to make films that cater to the world audiences.","It's very hard for me to find any sort of shame or blame in my life. I'm not made that way.","I have been the struggler of the century. Fortunately, everyone loves the underdog.","Sucking up to a director means you are unsure of your talents. I'm not.","Somewhere down the line, I realised that dairy products were giving me acidity, so now I am a vegan.","Before I turned vegetarian, I used to often cook seafood or my favourite breakfast of eggs and bacon. Now, I love making pulao or rice with lots of spices and vegetables.","There have been interviews with people saying they are jealous of Kangana. There are so many people who are jealous of my success.","Many people are insecure of many people.","For my life, I need to make my own choices.","Even when I was rebelling against my father, the point was to follow my own intuition and instinct.","In Bollywood, if you work with a superstar, even if you are a newcomer, you become a superstar. That didn't happen with me.","I'm my own hero on the sets; why should I work with other heroes? The Khans did not want to work with me when I started. Why should I work with them now?","I feel that we, as Indians, have a knack for loving a stereotypical, sobbing, sympathy-seeking personality. I feel that we need to promote quirky, cool and youthful talent. We have to stop propagating the sob-story angle of celebs, where they try to be larger-than-life. That is very outdated. It is so boring that it puts you to sleep.","I know the consequences of my decisions. I've said no to the biggest of brands. So when I say no to something, I know how much business I will lose out on.","I don't think there is anything unusual about my struggle. It's a very typical struggle where you meet bad people, and then you meet good people, and then you finally have a breakthrough.","No one can guarantee success of a film.","I am not ashamed of anything - not my past, not my affairs, not my body, and most definitely not my desire.","I really don't want to be known as a fashionista. I'd like to be someone more than that.","It's not like what I do or what I wear is my copyright. What I'm wearing now also is an inspiration. It is how I saw it on the mannequin, and I just wore it, so it's in a way copied. But obviously, I wouldn't want to spend my life thinking about dresses. It is such a waste of life.","I think the rejection - if it's taken in the right spirit, it can make you a better person. And I think that is what I've always striven for. If one thing didn't work out, a project or anything, it doesn't mean that I lose my own confidence. In fact, I give myself a lot more confidence and opportunities.","They will always assume that this guy - an upcoming actor, what if he becomes a star tomorrow? He would not work with me then... so I might as well choose to be nice. But women are not treated with the same attitude. Women they treat really badly.","I liked the fact that my father had a lot of expectations from my brother. I probably wanted to be that person who he could be proud of.","This man who was my father's age hit me hard on my head when I was 17. I started bleeding. I took out my sandal and hit his head hard, and he started to bleed, too.","Image means a lot. It is everything in the business that we are in.","The kind of roles which you get, people identify with your roles, and it then leads to the kind of brands you get.","You spend so much to buy these media net stories or full page ads to build perception... you can rather save this money and put it in the making or marketing of the film.","It is true that some people are interested in the buying part of things... They want to buy everything from the movie reviews to the media net to the opinions and so on.","When you are romancing a woman in a relationship, it should be poetic. It should have layers.","In 'Rangoon', I play an action star of the 1940s.","Nobody is like Tanuja Trivedi in this whole world.","I think the kind of films and roles I do takes a whole year... I think it is justified. At some point, we have to come to that place where we are equally paid. It is a small step... we are headed to that direction.","There is a huge gap between the remuneration of an actor and actress.","Male actors get into production, share profit, and they don't take money at times but are involved in some capacity which is economical and resourceful. These things suit them; as they have made a place for themselves, they have command over the box office.","The glorification of sisters, mothers as the selfless Indian women who will do 'agni pariksha' and the one who sees her own betterment only in the betterment of their husbands and fathers, that has to stop.

I hope I never get a script with snakes.","I am now in a position to choose roles. I did not have so many offers before 'Queen,' but now things have changed a lot.","My views are very fluctuating. I have very contradictory takes on the subject. Dating is easier, while marriage is hard work. You see your friends having early divorces, and on the other hand, you see your parents having a successful marriage.","I don't really give into all that philosophical talks that 'money is not everything.'","I am an independent girl. I always put my work first in my priority.","My sister and I had jointly heard the narration of 'Revolver Rani' in Tigmanshu Dhulia's office.

It was a light mood.","I don't know if I'm able to play a cop for the rest of my life.","I'm from a reserve. A reservation. So I know everybody. Everybody knows me.","It was so crazy, lucky, that 'Defiance' and 'Hemlock Grove' was shooting in Toronto at the same time.

One can get away by being dishonest for a short term, but ultimately, honesty is what pays.","All you have to do is to dream big and try to fulfil it.","Sports should not become routine. It should be about passion.","Fast bowling is an art, like spin bowling.","Cricket has become more popular, not me... When the game grows, those who've played it also 'grow.'","I have played cricket on my own terms.","When I was a boy, cricket was very, very English. Anyone who spoke English and anyone from a big town could play. And that was it.","When you are growing up, everyone will help you. When you reach the top, everyone will start pulling you down. The same people who help you will be the same people who try to pull you down.","Try and understand: cricket was played by Commonwealth countries only; now it has started in other countries as well, and I am proud of that.","My role models have kept on changing.","If you are playing on a turning wicket, toss plays an important role. The team that wins the toss gets an opportunity to play on the fresh wicket. You should always prepare the wicket as per team's strength. But a rank turner might backfire.","Spirituality lies in what you do and how you do it and not what result you get.","The hunger to win must not die... The appetite has to remain big.","Though teenagers are generally very interested in sports, they must realise that education is the most important thing in their lives. They must find the right balance.","I never wanted to take autographs, always wanted to give them. To do this, you have to achieve something.","Good sports facilities are a blessing.","Virat Kohli has so far shown that he has more ability and talent than anybody else, and if he can play till 32 or 34 with same fitness and without injuries, he will come to a point where not even Vivian Richards neither Sachin Tendulkar had such a record.","I, as a cricketer, would like to see 100 counties playing top-flight cricket, just like tennis and football. If I am alive to see that, I will be very happy.","Let me clarify it through the national news agency that I am not joining Aam Aadmi Party. There has been reports that I will be officially joining AAP, but I can assure you that nothing of that sort is happening.","I have no political aspirations. That's it.","I used to hate any batsman who would not get out in my deliveries.","Maybe a day will come when we may have to just put on a pair of glasses and see sports events.","There is inspiration all around us.","If I can teach cricket overseas, why wouldn't I do so in my own country?","I never said, 'I wouldn't help a cricketer if he approaches me.'","Sports is my passion.","No cricket should be played for at least a month anywhere in the world after a World Cup.","All artists are crazy.","I have great respect for Jaypee Greens as a company that has produced a truly world class, 24-carat, championship golf course. I am happy to be associated with a company with such outstanding qualities.","The biggest test for any cricketer in England is the weather.","Certain cricketers are meant to play Test cricket.","It isn't easy being a celebrity cricketer in India.","I wasn't a ladies' man.","Selectors can't please everyone, but I am OK if they are working for the benefit of Indian cricket. It's an administrative decision to appoint a selection committee, and I would like to let them do their job.","Speed can't always get you wickets.","As a sportsman, my aim was to help sportspersons grow. The idea is to see what is good for sport rather than what's good for individuals.","The next generation has always been and will be better than the previous one. If it is not, then the world would not be moving forward.","My best wishes are with Indian cricket in general. I wish each one of our cricketers success at the international and domestic level.","People never expected a boy from a small town to have a life like I did.","When you have to work, work with a smile.","If you have two good off spinners, what is the problem in playing both of them.","When you take risks and things don't go your way, you can be heavily criticised by the media.","I feel that World Cup cricket should be played like football in which all the 160 countries take part. If only a handful of countries are going to keep on playing in the World Cup without making the game popular, I will be a sad man.","As an Indian, I would like to back my government.","I am not too intelligent.","I think pride is more important sometimes than making money.","People often ask me whether I believe in God. I haven't seen God. But I think that one's beliefs are one's God - and, in those terms, yes, God is there.","If your work becomes a source of enjoyment and a challenge, it will never seem like work - it will be fun. If you ever feel that your work is a burden, there is no point carrying on with it.","Test cricket is a different sort of cricket altogether. Some players who are good for one-day cricket may be a handicap in a Test match.","The West Indians and Pakistanis play one-day cricket so well because they play for English counties.","One can't feel old in a day or overnight!"],"Kapil Sharma":["It was a unique childhood, to say the least. My father was born in Patiala to refugee parents and was a part of the Indian Air Force. The talented few amongst the Air Force pilots are made test pilots. Test pilots are best suited to look at the space programme as they are trained to expect the unexpected.","I am an Air Force brat who grew up at various Air Force bases. I changed six schools in about five years and got stability for the first time when I was sent to a boarding school, Rishi Valley. I lived outside of a cantonment-style living and was among an eclectic mix of kids and got exposed to books and other things.","I grew up thinking that I would become a fighter pilot and was fascinated by aircrafts as I had grown up around that. But my father encouraged me to not become an Air Force person, given the varied interests I had, be it books, movies, sports or fighter flying.","The problem with feature filmmaking is that it offers you this mirage of being able to achieve perfection, as the theory of it is that you have control of every part of the film, though in reality, it is as inexact as the next thing in your life.","My mother is very funny. She is from a village; she has a typical village kind of humour. Often she says a lot of things she herself isn't aware is a punch line.","Every artist says that he/she wants to do something challenging, and I'm not any different. If someone approaches me with a serious role, I'll be more than happy.","One can do a film and not work for six months, but on TV, you have to produce good content every week. It involves a lot of hard work, as one has to fight for ratings every week. But I have always got love from the audiences, be it during 'The Great Laughter Challenge' or 'Comedy Circus.'","People expect comedy from me but I am not just a stand-up comedian anymore. I act on stage, host 'Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa' and also conduct interviews on my show. I have grown as a person and an artiste.","People tell me that my appearance in real life is better than on-screen. Perhaps people think I am exactly like the characters I play on TV.","People think I am funny all the time. But I am not. I am serious, too. Also, I enjoy serious, dramatic films.","My style is an extension of acting and an outcome of some serious lessons I picked up learning when I did theatre in my early days.","I'm a fun-loving guy. We are basically from Amritsar and ours is a chilled-out family. I think I have got my humour from my mother.","I am always scared before going on stage; this is the fear which makes me do well.","I used to do a lot of serious theatre during my school and college days. Comedy was only reserved for youth festival and inter-college competitions. Then once 'The Great Indian Laughter Challenge' was launched, a regional channel in Punjab started a program based on that. I participated in it and emerged as the winner."],"Kapil Sibal":["Intolerance is alien to Hinduism.","The success of a particular policy prescription is always a gamble.","My voice is not good enough for me to sing a song.","The judiciary is entitled to finally resolve a dispute. Not every decision is right.","The government must adopt a rights-based approach that speaks to the needs and aspirations of surrogate mothers, children born out of surrogacy, and all individuals who want access to altruistic surrogacy services.","Cleanliness is a good thing, which the society should embrace. But it has nothing to do with Modi, nor can he implement it.","I have been writing poetry for a long time now. I started writing in my school days.","Appointments to the higher judiciary must be through transparent processes, which ensure that persons of impeccable integrity and high competence are appointed to these positions.","Yes, the state must intervene to prevent the exploitation of poor Indian women who are enticed or coerced into surrogacy, as well as to protect the rights of surrogate children. However, it should also be empathetic to individuals with alternative lifestyles who are well within their legal and human rights to demand access to surrogacy services.","If you employ an army, have money, bombard cyberspace with misinformation, innocent people tend to buy it.","We're trying to create a better world, not a perfect one. It cannot ever be perfect.","The genesis of Public Interest Litigation in listening to the voice of the voiceless and giving access to the poor, the marginalised, and the weak is a unique experiment to be lauded.","Humility is an attribute of every good Hindu.","In India, by and large, women are not educated enough to be bread winners and, within the moorings of traditional cultures, do not have the courage and the capacity to leave the matrimonial home. Given the inequality prevalent in family structures, the woman's right to opt out is suicidal.","Ownership is a very complex judicial concept.","I personally believe technology can transform the functioning of the judicial system.","No one can end it, but incidents of corruption can be reduced.","The DNA of a true Hindu is liberal. We are, by essence, liberal.","Given an opportunity, Modi has violated the freedom of press both in letter and spirit. He destroys freedom of the press whenever he gets a chance.","Ever since Modi became prime minister, he has given a free rein to his ministers and BJP functionaries to create an environment of communal tension and violence.","Sedition involves sloganeering with incitement. It may be anti-national, but not a crime, unless you incite violence or communal tension.","I think poetry is a fabulous medium to encapsulate thoughts far more precisely than prose.","The appointment of judges to the higher judiciary cannot be the sole domain of a few members of the higher judiciary. This turf must be shared.","I would welcome satirical references to political leaders as part of freedom of expression.","How do you trust a government whose people are proved to be untrustworthy?","Just as judges have enormous stake in the appointment of judicial officers in the higher judiciary, the government has an equal stake. Since both of us have stakes in the appointment of members of the higher judiciary, the consultation of both of them is absolutely necessary. The government must have a say.","To the youth who have taken up guns, I urge them to return to their parents and shun violence.","Judges decide upon copyright law. They decide upon trademark law. They decide upon scientific issues. They decide upon very complex technical issues on a daily basis. So you must have confidence in the Supreme Court, that they will apply their mind and they will come out with a decision consistent with the Constitution.","How do you trust a prime minister who said one thing before the elections and does exactly the opposite after the elections?","Politics runs in every human being, and so does music.","For a movie, you have to make sure the lyrics are consistent with the rhythm that is given to you. But, at times, during the song's recording, you find out that your words are not appropriate for the track, and so you have to change them.","If the Planning Commission said those who live above Rs 5,000 a month are not at poverty line, obviously there is something wrong with the definition of poverty in this country. How can anybody live at Rs 5,000?","We are wedded to freedom of expression and shall do nothing to diminish that freedom.","We are great believers in the idea that the Internet can help bring justice, but justice varies from place to place across the world.","Internet governance is an oxymoron. The Internet must govern itself. But you can't play cricket without any rules.","While the Internet is important for us, India is also necessary for the Internet with its 1.2 billion population.","India should be an exporter of technology.","If two people cannot live together, both should have the right to opt out of the marriage. In an ideal world, that would be an acceptable solution.","Unless the issue of the empowerment of women is addressed, the practice of women being unfairly treated will remain unresolved.","What the government and we in society need to do is to address the issue of gender justice.","There is an urgent need for the Central government to take the lead in ensuring health and nutrition service delivery.","The government must understand that it cannot substitute the health, nutrition, and overall development outcomes of Indian citizens with 'efficiency gains.'","To fix India's healthcare scenario, what is most needed is 'systems thinking.' For far too long, India has followed a vertical approach in its health sector, which translated into disease-specific national programmes being set up.","We must make the government accept that at a time when we are expected to look ahead, we cannot afford to start discriminating against our own people in the name of 'ethos.'","By limiting access to surrogacy based on flimsy and exclusionary criteria, the government may just give rise to a mushrooming black market.","The fabric of our Constitution and our civilisational culture is based on tolerance.","The mindset of a terrorist and the mindset of intolerance know no territorial boundaries when individuals are targeted either for their eating habits or for any other reason.","Market mechanisms are totally irrelevant when resources are used to serve a larger purpose, especially for the underserved, unserved, or marginalised.","A single element in transactional mode can never be analysed to calculate either loss or presumptive loss. The losses or gains of all elements in the transaction need to be analysed.","Economists often get the market wrong.","My abiding faith in the wisdom of our electorate is what gives me hope.","The BJP, undoubtedly, is a party with a mission. Spreading hatred and religious discord, indulging in state-sponsored violence and fake encounter killings, and resorting to divisive politics have been integral to this mission.","When the state machinery defends criminals and the public prosecutors collude with the accused in certain cases and the victims are members of a particular community, then 'Justice to all' is empty rhetoric.","Natural resources must be so distributed, by way of auction or otherwise, that they serve a larger public purpose.","The optimal use of natural resources can be made only if there is a well-thought-out policy framework for their exploitation towards a particular end use.","The greater the power, the greater the responsibility in its exercise.","Public interest is a very unruly horse.","Most of us tend to be swayed by what we read. Judges are not superhuman. They, too, are mortals. This is why they have to be exceptionally careful in rendering decisions, which cause unintended consequences.","Normally, the law of nature is such that one who rises falls, and one who rises quickly falls as quickly. I don't know how the law of nature will work as far as Modi is concerned. But some time or the other, all bubbles burst. This bubble will also burst.","Our party never tolerated those who use violence for political ends. Our leaders lost their lives standing against terrorism.","There's a difference between those who breed terrorism and those who fight terrorism. This difference should be recognised by the people of India.","You may dislike what somebody else has said; that is perfectly valid. You may not agree with what somebody else has said. But saying something cannot possibly amount to sedition.","Nationalism and anti-nationalism is a matter of perception. You cannot mandate who is a nationalist and what is not.","An individual can have a point of view. He is entitled to that.","To embrace Hindutva is to embrace an obscurantist, backward looking, divisive ideology that seeks to polarise society through identity politics.","That's what technology does to you - makes you lazy but allows you to innovate.","You learn on the job. When I was a young lawyer and got a case, I knew nothing about the subject. You start reading, you look for the philosophy behind it, and by the time you are actually in a court of law, you are a master.","Through geospatial technologies, you can plan a whole city sitting in your room.","The justice delivery system needs structural change. It needs fresh vision and innovative solutions.","The overreach of the judiciary can be attributed to, one, the inability of the executive to deliver; and two, the tendency to issue judicial pronouncements for national good. The second element is dangerous because that's the function of the government.","M&A guidelines need to be liberal.","I came into politics by accident. I may go out of politics by accident.","I have no personal ambitions. I consider it a great privilege to have been given an opportunity to serve, through the Congress party, the people of India. I think that itself is a great reward. I have no personal ambitions in that regard.","When I took over the ministry for science and technology, our weather systems were in shambles. Nobody believed in the IMD. Nothing was in digital mode. I changed all that. We got automatic rain gauges, automatic weather stations, Doppler radars.","Can any sane person say that before something comes on the Net you must screen it? How can there be pre-screening?","The press in India, I believe, is more free, and happily so, than perhaps media anywhere in the world. Right? Which is a good thing.","Public figures will get public criticism, and they should be tolerant enough to take it.","BJP is the mothership of violence.","Modi is an excellent orator - sure, anybody who spouts untruths is an excellent orator.","Every child should get an opportunity to study irrespective of the economic status.","I believe a true Hindu in India could never have endorsed the killing of the Mahatma.","We do not want to interfere with the freedom of press.","Modi may be rich in politics but is poor at heart.","I have never applied for a share in Tehelka.","I have only one sister, Asha Nanda, and she lives in Maharani Bagh.","Corruption is everywhere. It's not just in the Congress. Corruption is not just your prerogative or mine.","Corruption is in society and in every strata of society.","The media can allege corruption, but if I do the same against the media, I am gagging freedom of expression.","All of us have a romantic streak in us. That's why we are fallible, aren't we?","I am a lawyer by profession.","Universities are not places where police can come and arrest people. Let the children have a discourse as they want to. They will learn as they move on in life. But to target individuals and institutions is dangerous.","Sports can't be run by governments.","Governments getting involved in sports activities would ultimately damage sports.","If there are malpractices in sports, part of the solution lies in the organisations themselves taking a very strong view and cleaning up the mess from within.","Great research universities around the world are visible not just through their quality graduates but as knowledge creators and technology developers.","The great challenge before the IITs is to act as a catalyst in the growth of quality technical education in the country.","It would be a matter of concern for government if intrusive data capture has been deployed against Indian citizens or government infrastructure.","If you have decisions taken from time to time at the level of the executives, which gives the impression of being discriminatory, if you are not open when government is functioning, then obviously people will make allegations.","When you have a limited resource and you have a lot of people wanting that resource, then those who get more justify as to why they got more, and those who get less say they have been treated badly.","No matter who the prime minister is, incremental changes take place. The economy moves on."],"Kara DioGuardi":["I felt like I got more comfortable on 'Idol' when I just started being myself and not trying to be what I thought I had to be.","Listen to the Bee Gees and you can learn to be a great writer.","I've never in my life bought a big piece of jewelry - like, 'I'm gonna get myself a big piece of jewelry!' Songwriters' lives are unstable and up and down. Even though mine has sort of has followed more of a going toward the sky trajectory.","I wanted a child, and there was no way I could get pregnant under the stress of 18-hour work days and live TV. When you're somebody who's used to making a decision about what they want to do and getting it and achieving it, when your body fails you, it's a whole other experience.","I can sing in front of people. I can go on a TV show, live, and not feel like I'm going to throw up.","The thing that's tricky is sometimes the best voices - just because someone hits the big notes and sounds amazing - it doesn't necessarily mean they make the greatest artists.","I can make the argument that people who don't have the biggest ranges but have very unique voices, even if they may be pitchy at times... with the right record that's really unique and distinct, they can have big hits.","Look at someone like Ke$ha. I wouldn't say she's got the most rangy, incredible voice, but she's got a thing. She stands for something, and people are buying into that.","I don't go to record stores to look at my albums, but it's always a thrill to see them.","I was a pop-music junkie. My parents were into Frank Sinatra and Doris Day. They weren't too excited when I had Aretha or the Stones pumping.","I have breakups that I can credit to every song. In my twenties, I picked people who would create that dysfunction and drama, so I could draw upon it.","I don't think people really understood what I did. And you know, in my book, 'A Helluva High Note' deals with my back story, that I was a songwriter, that I spent years trying to hone my craft and being rejected and then finally becoming a successful songwriter, record executive and publisher.","I've never been fired in my life.","Songwriters tell the truth.","I'm a native New Yorker, so I'm edgier; I kind of tell it like it is.","You need to understand that a skilled professional songwriter can accelerate your success as an already talented musician. These people are writing every single day, so their craft is really sharp, and it's the best songwriters who consistently get on the radio.","There's a lot of craft that goes into achieving a hit song - at the beginning of your career, you're usually more inspiration than craft, and you get great when those intersect. A skilled songwriter can get you to that intersection.","Some of the best songs that artists perform year after year are ones they hated.","A great song should make you stop everything that you're doing. You should be so into it that you just can't imagine doing anything else for that moment. You wouldn't even dream of picking up the phone.","Yeah... I was a singer as a kid. I had a lot of stage fright, and what's happened with 'Idol,' it has got me past so much of that.","Just because you're a star on television doesn't mean that you can be a music phenomenon or an artist. You have to have the material to back it, and it's all about hit songs. I can name you every 'Idol' winner and why they didn't go on to have success - their songs. The ones who have - their songs.","I think Bruno Mars is a great example of a great voice and classic songwriting with a twist that makes it contemporary. I think he's done a great job of it. I think Katy Perry has undeniable songs for what she does, for that pop market. And, if we're talking in the truly pop market, I would say those two.","When I look at myself, I'd like not to have hair on the top of the ceiling.","Good new songs are the backbone of the music industry. There isn't an artist out there who could survive without hit songs."],"Kara Hayward":["I read whatever is put in front of me. I gobble up books.","If I have to go to New York or something, I'll bring my books and read and do homework. It's not really a big deal.","I think that a lot of kids today focus on impressing each other. And while that's really nice, you also have to think about your future, about getting into a good school.","As an actor, I'm my own worst critic, but after awhile, really, when you watch 'Moonrise Kingdom', it's such a fantastic film that you sort of get sucked into the story, and then you kind of forget about everything else.","I would say that Emma Stone and Emma Watson are two very talented young actresses who are very intelligent and have a great sense of humor and have learned to balance what they love with their acting career, and I think that's really a great thing.","I would love to continue acting. Maybe one day I would like to try writing and directing.","One of my favorite films is 1994's 'Little Women', with Winona Ryder and Kirsten Dunst.","I would definitely love to continue acting, and I also really enjoy school, so I would like to balance the two somehow.","I think I would like to write screenplays, books, really anything.","Anything with a good story and characters I think would be great.","In a play, you only get one chance, and you have to get it perfect. In a film, you can change and fix it whatever way you want, so really, there's a pretty big difference.","You have to find out how to become the character.","I got a manager, and I thought, since I was going out on auditions, I should do this for a living. Then there was this moment on set when I realized I was having a lot of fun, and I really wanted to do this forever.","Two young actresses I admire are Emma Stone and Emma Watson, because they are intelligent, talented actresses and have a great sense of humor. They have learned to balance what they love in life - acting, school and everything else.","I love to write.","I'm pretty casual, but I'm starting to obsess a little bit; like, one of my favorite things to do is to pair really feminine accessories with edgier outfits or vice versa.","I'm starting to find my own style."],"Kara Lindsay":["I loved Judy Garland. I thought she was such a classic beauty. I thought she was so endearing and charming, and I loved her voice. She was such a dreamer, and I think I was, too - and I am.","I started off dancing and playing sports, and I joined the drama stuff, the theatre stuff in middle school because my friends were involved, and it was kind of the cool thing to do.","I'd always wanted to be on Broadway one day, but it seemed like a dream that might be unattainable. This business has a lot of ups and downs and I learned that pretty quickly.","'Newsies' is definitely aerobic! The boys have to do a lot more than I do in the show, but for 'King of New York,' the big Act Two tap number, I have to be warmed up or I will hurt myself.","I loved Belle in 'Beauty and the Beast.' I just wanted to be her. I'm a brunette, so I think I kind of cling to all those princesses that have brown hair. I just wanted to be them.","I did 'Lone Star Love' in 2007 with Randy Quaid, and that was supposed to come to Broadway at the Belasco and a marquee went up and everything... and it all fell apart, and that marquee came right down, and we got severance pay. And, it was very sad.","I don't know how to speak to celebrities. Every time I talk to Alan Menken, I say something stupid and I have to apologize.","I used to listen to 'Perfect Day' by Hoku every single day in high school! 'On this perfect day, nothin' standin' in my way... Don't you try to rain on my perfect day.' It pumped me up when I was feeling down or defeated, whether it was from the cool kids making me feel left out or feeling overwhelmed with homework and mean teachers.","I loved math and science. It just made sense to me. But my hatred for world history has come to bite me in the butt in my adult years. Every show I have done professionally has required me to study the world in which my characters lived.","Seeing family is what brings me peace. If I'm not traveling home on my day off, I love going to Central Park to be around trees and throw a Frisbee with my boyfriend.","I can't wait for summer in the city! I love all the free activities in the parks that become available to us New Yorkers. Yoga and movie screenings in Bryant Park, concerts in Central Park - there's so much more available to the New York community in the summer! And everyone just seems to smile more.","I thought, 'OK, Melissa Gilbert is playing my mom, and I'm playing her old role - no pressure.' So I went up to Melissa and said, 'It's such an honor playing your daughter,' and she smiled and said, 'Oh, shut up.' I thought, 'Great, a normal person.'"],"Kara Swisher":["Here's the thing: I fell impossibly in love with the Internet from the minute I saw it in action in the early 1990s. From that moment on, I have studied it, analyzed it, reported on it, and, mostly, have not been without it as a part of my daily life since.","People are worried about what's going to happen to journalism - and they should be. Every day, the blogosphere is getting better and print media is getting worse; you have to be an idiot not to see that.","I always find something interesting on Twitter that leads me somewhere else.","In Greek mythology, Cassandra was given the gift of prophecy, except - due to her rejection of Apollo's affections - nobody would ever believe her warnings.","We really spend a lot of time on building relationships. And so when everyone is like, 'How do you break so many stories?' it's because I build relationships. I do it the old-fashioned way, and I build sourcing relationships, and then I take advantage of those relationships over time.","The tech industry - and, more specifically, Silicon Valley - continues to stumble forward in earnest about how few women are represented in its top ranks of management and on its boards.","No matter how young you are, you're too old for SXSW.","While having a profound impact on the development of values is surely an important job of a good parent, force-feeding opinions to them is not.","My father died when I was only five years old, and that was the moment when I learned a cruel lesson that tomorrow, in fact, might not be another day.","Dr. Louis Bush Swisher died from the complications of a brain aneurysm that burst without warning one sunny Sunday morning less than 40 years ago.","Really smart people don't want to say stupid things, and they really don't want to be a part of a PR-engineered interview. People really do want to be smart, and they want smart questions. So, if you ask smart questions, there's no way you can't do well.","Mark Zuckerberg needs no introduction these days, what with all the magazine covers and morning news shows. My mother knows who he is now, and my mother can hardly turn on a computer.","With giant sites like Facebook and MySpace becoming as generic as Yahoo and AOL of old, more and more sites will be looking for an edge by drilling down deeply to serve a highly targeted audience.","Canceling my landline phone account, cutting off service to my home for good, and rendering the telephones that had long sat on tables in every room as useless as my closeted bread machine, I took the final step in a lifelong attempt to free myself from the wires that tethered me.","One of my favorite vacation memories was the Thai foot massage and Internet access salons in Bangkok, followed up by my testing cellphone coverage while wading in Provincetown Harbor on Cape Cod.","I love all my scoop children. But consistency and persistence is really my aim.","I am a big proponent of being in touch with everyone even when I do not have a story to ask about.","Most reporters are so transactional rather than strategic.","I don't think you can look at my history and say they love me to death in Silicon Valley.","I'm focused on getting to a place where we can prove that journalism can make good money on the web.","I don't write about Google except to insult the company.","It's the nature of journalism to need to be close to your subjects. And either you're able to be tough on them, which a lot of us are, or you get in bed with them, and some people do.","I don't have bad taste; I have no taste. I wear a lot of the things I wore in high school, but not the cowl-neck sweaters. I was never tall, and I am the same size, so I still wear a lot of those clothes.","Everything is a narrative in life. I learned that early on as a reporter at the 'Washington Post.'","Sure, I am funny and have a good sense of humor. Mostly, though, I just tell the truth. The internal dialogue people have in their heads - I just write it.","Readers appreciate the truth. Why say, 'Some think a situation is a mess?' Based on my reporting, if a situation is a mess, then I say that. The truth is always what reporters tell each other when they get back to the newsroom.","It's not all silliness, as interactive SXSW is filled with aggressive learning, discussing, and a whole lot of futurizing.","Wherever you go at SXSW, there you are standing in line. Or watching other people stand in line.","Casting my fate to the heavens, quite literally, I decided to go wireless. Completely wireless. All wireless, all the time, everywhere.","Equipped with two cell phones - one for work and another for home - I like to think of myself as a kind of 21st-century digital pioneer, ready to network, fax, page, e-mail and - oh, yes - talk at will.","My telephone manners were, well, offensive to some. As I lugged my cell around, yammering away, I noticed cold stares from passersby who viewed me as a kind of techno-terrorist, or at least incredibly rude.","I am an unrepentant tweetaholic. I use the communications service all day long to discover news, interesting tidbits and, of course, to flack the work of our tech and media news site, Re/code.","I used to do a lot of casual photography - back in the olden times when one used film - but it had fallen by the wayside over the years.","For the record, my mother is an astonishing and loving grandmother.","Is a family just the strict definition of a small and discrete unit, or is it about the larger organic group that inevitably grows up around the smaller one?","It seemed like most of the memories faded before they had time to form. And after a while, my life with my father seemed like a familiar story or a distant dream.","I don't mean to sound like a touchy-feely California type here, but I knew that I could finally get over the death of my father only by having kids of my own.","Having a baby had always seemed the easiest and most natural thing to do, and I had never felt - even in my most furtive days of coming out - that being gay would mean I could not become a mother.","I bought tiny infant onesies while still in college and compiled a killer toy collection throughout my 20s and 30s.","I think things can surprise you. I mean, I loved Instagram from the minute it started, but I think it surprised a lot of people how quickly it got huge.","I think the way to be an influential journalist is to be accurate and to be fair and to get things right and to really characterize things in an honest way, versus being really snarky or cheerleading.","'On demand' is more than just a series of clicks on your still-too-complicated remote control. In fact, it is now the best way to describe what the cable industry - from programmers to content makers to distributors - imagine their world is. Services and content available to very demanding consumers, wherever, whenever, however.","Unlike the messier MySpace, Facebook has a cleaner and easier-to-customize interface and is much more, as Zuckerberg once described it to me, 'utilitarian.' I would call it useful and more relevant than other competitors, and a white-label version would likely be a hit.","The fact of the matter is that the true hits of AOL have always been its easy-to-use services, such as AIM, email, and Buddy Lists.","A Microsoft-Yahoo merger is a deal only an investment banker could love.","As anyone who has covered the company for any length of time knows, Yahoo's record on major decision-making has been akin to a hippie commune - a lot of wrangling internally in a culture where everyone seems to have a voice and a reticence to push the button to launch.","While it is often true that the enemy of my enemy is my friend, it seems like Yahoo's almost obsessive focus on Google is taking away from its other businesses.","As more ad spending shifts online, the ability to have expertise and to innovate quickly will become critical.","It's easy to forget the ever-plodding eBay with all the noise made by the more lithe and lively Web 2.0 companies.","I know: I am a freakish geek. Or is that a geekish freak?","While a lot of what is on Facebook is a better amalgam of what AOL, Yahoo, Amazon, and other Web pioneers introduced long ago, with a nice dash of connection and really identified community, this kind of thing is not a new idea.","While I am not saying Facebook cannot be a wonderland for marketers, I am still waiting to see the proof of it, and so should every reporter.","BoomTown has long been a big fan of Martha Stewart.","Now I am not against widgets, those small third-party applications that people can put on their Web pages on social networks like Facebook and MySpace, in general.","As I have said many times - I like Facebook. I think it is well built and run. It's cool. I think it is, in its next-step way, even visionary.","Luckily for both the tech industry and Hollywood, there is only one thing that counts - use of the Internet is still growing exponentially, as consumers shift to digital everything from analog.","I have found, writing a blog, that being non-opaque is necessary. You pretty much have to say what you know in much more firm terms or risk that the legions who always know more than you do will tell the story better.","As I always like to keep in mind about everything: Don't fight the trend.","It is hard to look away from the swirl of media that the untimely and tragic death of Heath Ledger has engendered, and the Internet has jacked the frenzy into overdrive.","While some debate its helpfulness at generating monetizable traffic, when Digg points to a story, huge audience spikes quickly follow.","As I have seen with a lot of companies I have covered, acquisition interest can be a heady experience, and not always in a good way.","I, for one, am pretty exhausted since I started blogging almost a year ago. But I am blaming that on my two sons, aged 3 and 6, whose perpetual-motion-machine energy is hard to keep up with at my advanced age.","Despite my so-so-experience with the iPhone, I do love its touchscreen technology, a feature I miss with my standard-issue BlackBerry."],"Kara Walker":["Once you open up the Pandora's box of race and gender... you're never done.","I have no interest in making a work that doesn't elicit a feeling.","The promise of any artwork is that it can hold us - viewer and maker - in a conflicted or contestable space, without real-world injury or loss.","There is something very strange and unsettling for me about making a work that doesn't fit with what's the norm or what's acceptable. There's something both liberating about it and challenging. I can imagine it doing more harm than good.","The illusion is that most of my work is simply about past events: a point in history and nothing else.","To be a truly conscientious artist, you have to look at what's not working and challenge it. You riff on things.","I'm fascinated with the stories that we tell. Real histories become fantasies and fairy tales, morality tales and fables. There's something interesting and funny and perverse about the way fairytale sometimes passes for history, for truth.","I trust my hand. If I go into a space with a roll of paper, I can make a work, some kind of work, and feel pretty satisfied.","I was making big paintings with mythological themes. When I started painting black figures, the white professors were relieved, and the black students were like, 'She's on our side.' These are the kinds of issues that a white male artist just doesn't have to deal with.","I guess there was a little bit of a slight rebellion, maybe a little bit of a renegade desire that made me realize at some point in my adolescence that I really liked pictures that told stories of things - genre paintings, historical paintings - the sort of derivatives we get in contemporary society.","I'm a sponge for historical images of black people and black history on film.","I've seen people glaze over when they're confronted with racism, and there's nothing more, you know, damning and demeaning to having any kind of ideology than people just walking the walk and saying what they're supposed to say and nodding, and nobody feels anything.","A lot of what I was wanting to do in my work and what I have been doing has been about the unexpected... that unexpected situation of wanting to be the heroine and yet wanting to kill the heroine at the same time.","Challenging and highlighting abusive power dynamics in our culture is my goal; replicating them is not.","I knew I wanted to be an artist, but I didn't really know what it was I wanted to say.","I don't think that my work is very moralistic - at least, I try to avoid that. I grew up with that sermonising tendency, and I don't think visual work operates like that.","Sugar crystallizes something in our American soul. It is emblematic of all industrial processes. And of the idea of becoming white. White being equated with pure and 'true': it takes a lot of energy to turn brown things into white things. A lot of pressure.","I really love to make sweeping historical gestures that are like little illustrations of novels.","It feels like a game, this work I do. It is totally heartfelt, and I love the sticky terrain, the straight-up cartoons, how the irrepressible and icky rise to the surface. But I am not just trying to call forth bugaboos and demons for the sake of it, for fun.","I grew up partially around Stone Mountain, Georgia, and in that part of the country, there was always this aura of mythology and palpable sense of otherness about being a Southerner.","My work is really abject and self-effacing sometimes. I mean, it's big and overwrought, but it's just paper dolls, and it's kind of silly.","I am performing this role of the artist and this role of the 'negress' coming into a white-box institution. It's kind of a self-appointed role: the self-designated negress.","There was a manifesto in the late '60s/early '70s, and it basically laid out what 'black art' was and that it should embrace black history and black culture. There were all these rules - I was shocked, when I found it in a book, that it even existed, that it would demarcate these artists.","I don't know how much I believe in redemptive stories, even though people want them and strive for them.","I never learned how to be adequately black. I never learned how to be black at all.","Humor's always been the problem of my work, hasn't it? When working, I feel satisfied when I surprise myself. And when I surprise myself, I wind up laughing.","I took a political stance early on, but I don't think my work is overtly political. I respond to events.","I know that in my family there are histories of violence that are internal family things and that are oftentimes dealt with internally. By internally, I mean inside the family group, but also partly inside ourselves. You know, self-hatred and hostility and rage and this cycle that won't break.","As a child, I was subjected to a lot of spaghetti Westerns and hated them. I wanted the Indians to win - or just not be so sad!"],"Karan Johar":["I don't know about happy endings, because I don't think, eventually, anything is happy. You feel a bout of happiness with good news. Five minutes later, there could be a traffic jam or a phone call from an irritating relative or a weird thought, or it could be a tweet that annoys you, and your emotion will flip immediately.","Sometimes you just wonder whether people just don't have the sensitivity or decency. I'm a member of the media myself: I host a talk show. I know sometimes when you want to ask something, you can circumvent it with words and vocabulary. You don't suddenly just go out there and ask something directly in the pretense of being absolutely candid.","I am a Gemini and can adapt to most atmospheres. You get two for the price of one when you are a Gemini.","My mother was keen that I complete my graduation and never ever wanted me to be in the movies, as my father had made five films that lost money. One of the films he made was 'Agneepath,' which was hugely hyped but underwhelming at the box office, and I remember that my dad had to sell my grandmother's flat to pay off the loan.","Infidelity has always existed, but I feel like it was brushed under the carpet, behind the scenes. Now everyone is at it - and they've stopped pretending they're not.","I know I don't mind sharing my defects, my deficiencies, partly in the hope that someone will hear it and know that they're not alone.","My father was 40 when he had me, so he was more a grandparent than a parent.","There are ups and downs in so many relationships, but with Shah Rukh, there is deep love. There's no other way of communicating the respect and love I have for him. And I believe that ours will be a dynamic, and relationship and connect that will be forever.","Offence is no longer defence - it's a full-time profession. Everyone is so offended all the time. The new police force that we weren't told about: the moral police. No qualifications, no training, no understanding of actual morality, but they have a degree in the art of being offended.","Throughout my life, I have valued relationships far more than the professionalism.","I, of course, was born as if I was a movie star in my head. Even though I had nothing, in my head I was always royalty. My mother always said, 'I don't know where you came from'. I didn't have their value system. And I always lived beyond my means.","My primary passion is film-making. That's the aspect of my life that defines me, completes me, and completely grounds me. Everything else - from judging a reality TV show to hosting a talk show - is just a result of me being a film-maker. I am the happiest, satisfied and at peace when I am behind the camera.","I have never, ever talked about my orientation or sexuality because whether I am heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, asexual, it is my concern. I refuse to talk about it... I have not been brought up to talk about my sex life.","I want to walk the red carpet at the Oscars. I am in awe of the ceremony, and winning an Oscar would be the most magical moment of my life. I want to make that speech and hold that trophy and say, 'This is for you, India.' That's the line I have rehearsed for God knows how long. But that has to be for a Hindi language film.","I was one of the first early Twitter users from the film fraternity. And back then in 2009, I thought I was going to enter a world where people liked me, knew me, knew my work - it was going to be fine! All about the love, not the hate. And it was. At first.","I'm deeply stressed as a filmmaker, and I know I'm not alone. The censorship crisis, the moral policing, the politics of it has most of us on edge. I'm scared to use certain words: like, if I use 'Bombay,' will there be a problem?","For me, a child means an old-age insurance policy. I have a nurturing quality in me.","I don't claim to have led a saintly life. There have been a lot of one-sided love stories in my life.","I have invariably been in love when I haven't had the same reciprocated emotion at all. I don't choose to talk about my personal life because I believe that I don't want to, and I believe my personal life is personal.","I saw 'Brokeback Mountain' in a packed house in Chelsea, New York, when I was filming a Bollywood film there. Chelsea, being a predominately gay neighbourhood, had the most euphoric reaction. I saw couples holding hands and crying at the end. It was the most heartening viewing I have ever been to.","I'm sad, upset, and disheartened with the trolling that happens on social media... At the end of the day, this whole homophobia is so disheartening and upsetting. And then they say, 'Why don't you speak about your sexuality? You could be iconic in this country.' But I don't want to be iconic anywhere. I want to live my life.","In my experience, I think there's must ado about fidelity and infidelity. I think sometimes true emotional relationships can go beyond those.","My very shy Punjabi father never taught me about the birds and bees. So shy was he that he may have thought he would get arrested for even talking about it.","I am not a hound; I am an attention-seeker. Very different animal. My kind of attention requires greater finesse.","I'm exceptionally email un-savvy, so to reply to my emails is like a torture. It's like literally, half of all my emails, I get my secretary to type out for me. And the personal ones, I avoid and just pick up the phone and call them.","Everyone thinks I land in a chopper on top of my building and I have the most cushy existence. Could you understand that I might have the most messed up life myself?","I think that I have self esteem issues, really. If you really analyse it... People who really like me I have no interest in. The unattainable is always that I want to attain.","When I'm making a film, I'm obsessive about what I do, and I get totally into it. That's all I'm eating, breathing, living at that moment.","If I did have a six-pack to show and a great waistline to put out there to the universe or beautiful muscular legs, then I would not have to pout. The only thing I have going for me is a jawline.","I am always acting, be at a party, at work or in office. My attitude changes from meeting to meeting, from being serious to intense to funny, depending on who is in the room.","Tell me, who doesn't want to have a family to extend himself/herself?","Sometimes new voices have the most spectacular vision. It is uncluttered and organic.","I love that first-time feeling that I can't build in myself anymore, where I can learn and emulate other filmmakers. Be it Ayan Mukherjee, Punit Mahotra, Karan Malhotra, Tarun Mansukhani or Shakun Batra, all of them have taught me something or the other.","For good or bad, there is a certain level of generalisation when it comes to my work. I want to break that perception. My decision to direct 'Bombay Talkies' or to present 'The Lunchbox' is an attempt to do that. These are the films that gel well with my sensibility, and it's unfortunate, it's not the perception out there.","'The Lunchbox' is the kind of cinema that is true to its word and not cluttered or corrupted by some of the mainstream pre-requisites. I love the way I make movies, but there are certain stories that need to be told in a certain way, and 'The Lunchbox' is that movie, and I'm so proud to present this movie.","I feel what a spouse can do for you, no child or parent can. Just that if you get the right connect with your spouse, you get it going right.","I may adopt. I love children and I do feel the need to take the legacy forward. I am open to it, but emotionally you have to be ready for it. Raising a child is really a huge responsibility. And I should have that time and emotional energy to give to child. How and when is a decision my mother and I will take a few years from now.","Marriage is a definite no-no. I am totally married to my company. Emotionally, my mother fills up the void in my life. So there it is. My company is a spouse I will never cheat on, and my mother completes me as a son. I think I have a full family unit of my own.","My instinct about a human being is paramount. For me, when a director has walked into my room or an assistant that I have hired, who has later gone on to become a director, is purely based on human instinct, be it Ayan Mukerji, Karan Malhotra, Punit Malhotra or Tarun Mansukhani. I am very susceptible to human energy and energy of spaces.","Legal documents have mistrust written all over them. It's unfortunate, but the human DNA is so tuned to kind of taking you for granted that we tend to protect ourselves legally. That's why I don't read them as, if I read them, I will go soft. To me, the human relationship is far more important than the professional bond I share with anyone.","I grew up as the only child, and we did not have a large family. So for me and my mother, our friends tend to become our family.","Whether or not we communicate it, I definitely seek my mom's acceptance and approval for everything. She has a strong commercial sense of movies and is a quintessential audience. When she doesn't like something, I know there is reason to worry. When she loves something, there is reason to celebrate.","Two powerful people can't be friends.","I am not interested in producing fiction for Indian television at all, the reason being that I don't understand the medium. I can be a judge or a host; I can do that as an individual. But to produce TV content, you have to know the game.","I firmly believe that emotions are universal, and I know that when they connect with the audience, it works. There is no such thing as an entertaining or a serious film; there are good films and bad films. Good films will always find a vast audience.","I am incapable of directing a film like 'Agneenath.' I can do only what I am good at, so I would have been the worst choice to direct it. It has aggression, action and an inherent violence in it - things I am not capable of directing in my films.","I am a product of Indian cinema; I've grown up watching Indian films ever since I can remember. And song and dance is part of our lives; it's part of our culture; we wake up to songs, we sleep to lullabies, you know, we celebrate every religious and traditional function with music.","As a child, as a cinemagoer, I think there is nothing better than being in a cinema or watching a film. I think it's just a while magical... it almost feels like you're at a big party in India, where you're singing, you're dancing, you're laughing, you're crying, you feel like you're at a wedding because our films invariably cover all emotions.","Because I was the only child, I was completely indulged. My father thought I was the best looking boy. And even though I was at 100 kgs., he dismissed it as puppy fat. He thought that the sun came out of my head. If I got five out of ten marks, he thought I was half there and had only half way more to go.","I remember breaking the news to both my parents that I wanted to be a director, and they both looked very doubtful. They didn't know what a closet Hindi film buff I was. I used to dance to old Hindi films songs on the sly, so my decision to be a part of Hindi cinema was shocking even for my parents.","I have always been interested in fashion and even contemplated being a fashion designer at one point of time.","Few people know that I love local dhaba food. It is the best!","No one wanted to be my friend because of my lunchbox - because I never shared my lunchbox. One day the principal walked in and said, 'No one is friends with Karan Johar; who will be his friend?' My CEO today put his hand up there and said, he will.","Everybody knows what my sexual orientation is. I don't need to scream it out. I won't, only because I live in a country where I could possibly be jailed for saying this.","I'm not embarrassed about who I am. I'm not apologetic.","I've heard expressions like, 'Are you good in bed?' What does that even mean? For me, good in bed means sleeping seven hours. Undisturbed! If I get eight hours, that means I'm amazing!","I feel Victoria may have a Secret, but you don't have to know it!","For me, my country comes first. Nothing else matters but my country. I always felt that the best way to express your patriotism is to spread love, and that's all I ever tried to do through my work and my cinema.","I condemn any form of terrorism and especially the terrorism that would affect my country and me.","'Sairat' is a film I absolutely loved. I have great regard for the movie and its film-maker. The movie blew my mind.","I've been the lull, and I've been the storm and also somewhere in between. But that's OK. I love the limelight after all.","I find myself asking questions that as a filmmaker I never thought I would ask. Like I get a call from a magazine for a feature and my first question is, 'Cover or not?' Interview invite from a leading channel? I have stopped asking the topic. I'm just like 'Primetime or not?' If I am invited and put in the second row, I can be distraught for days!","Give me the flash lights, the red carpets, and all that goes with it. Please! Oh, and I love hoardings. I love them. Nothing makes me happier than my face splashed all over the city.","I do not understand why we are not raised to celebrate our bodies as children. Why we are told to be shy or awkward or self-conscious.","I'm a proud filmmaker, but everyone seems to have forgotten that. You're introduced, and someone will say, 'Arrey! Karan Johar! He does talk shows! He's judge!' And now my filmmaking has been lost, all my other accomplishments forgotten.","I'm not a walking fleet of vanity vans any more than I'm a walking, talking multi-star cast. I might want an entourage, but so far, it is entirely eluding me.","I met Hugh Jackman, and I was like, 'I love your movies!' And, of course, he asked, 'Which one?' A reasonable question, but I blanked completely. In that moment, I couldn't remember a single film that Hugh Jackman had done. So I copped out. 'The recent one!' And that was one of his biggest disasters. Well done, me.","I simply can't do one-word message replies: Yes. Ok. No. Sure. Cool. None of these are options for me. I must write something extra. Something personal. I put kisses and emoticons. Emoticons, by the way, are my very best friends. They have removed all the pressure of thinking up something personal to say.","From the time you open the newspapers to the time the lights go off at night, it's all lies. We lie the most to the people closest to us. For fear of hurting them, breaking their heart, or worrying them.","Honesty is wonderful, but I suspect it's also overrated.","I find that I don't lie about the big things in life. The things that matter. And about me. While I'm talking about myself, I rarely lie: I know who I am, my level of talent, that I'm not the most versatile filmmaker, the person I am. I don't lie about myself because I don't lie to myself.","My college friends call me Karu, which is the worst. Only in our country can we make a short form for a short name. But otherwise, I've never had a pet name all my life. But now, in official meetings, someone will call me KJo. And I'll judge that person in my head. Just call me Karan.","The first time I fell in love, I was in my 20s, and I loved someone right till I was 31. And then I felt that emotion died within me. I wasn't feeling alive at all.","I am constantly accused of being 'First World.' So what should I do? I can't apologise for my environment, upbringing, aesthetic.","I was swept by the narrative structure of film... you can create a world, you can destroy it, you can do what you want with it and serve it to people just the way you like.","I am very strongly paternal. My paternal instincts need to be acted upon. My love needs a release. I love everyone. I don't express my love enough, but the love within me needs a platform as a parent."],"Karan Mahajan":["There's a hustling, but also a self-centred vibe you can get from people in Delhi.","When a certain swathe of India's population considers the country's ancient past, it doesn't see a country fragmented into kingdoms, savaged by caste divisions, and mired in poverty; rather, what's envisioned is a vast, unified Hindu empire stretching from Kashmir to the Indian tip at Kanyakumari.","In Delhi, where I grew up, commerce is brusque. You don't ask each other how your day has been. You might not even smile. I'm not saying this is ideal - it's how it is. You're tied together by a transaction. The customer doesn't tremble before complaining about how cold his food is.","When we talk about 9/11 and 26/11 - which is the shorthand for the Mumbai attacks in 2008 - we're talking about the most successful terrorist attacks in history. When you start trying to study the most successful event of its kind, it actually doesn't make for great fiction because there isn't the kind of failure in it that fiction thrives on.","Yashpal, writing in the nineteen-fifties, sought to indict this culture of men, Hindus and Muslims alike, who value their freedom and power over the rights and lives of women.","American life is based on a reassurance that we like one another but won't violate one another's privacies. This makes it a land of small talk.","Reading galleys on the subway is the closest the publishing industry comes to having a standardized mating call.","The deadpan brilliance of John McCrea has been underrepresented in music since 2004, when Cake served up 'Pressure Chief.'","After a post-Bill Berry softening with albums like 'Up' and 'Reveal,' R.E.M. seems to be toughening up again; on the strength of the first single, 'Discoverer,' the band's new record looks to continue with the same muscular rock and roll that defined its last album, 'Accelerate.'","'This Is Not That Dawn' is remarkable in part for its careful and sensitive attention to women's lives - and also for its harsh critique of men and their failure to stop violence.","As a Punjabi, you only have to look at your own family's past to find horror stories about arranged marriages and brutality.","If Asian America exists, it is because of systemic racism.","Asian-Americans are still regarded as 'other' by many of their fellow-citizens.","When more Chinese started coming after the Gold Rush, employed on large projects like the Pacific Railroad, anti-Chinese sentiment became shrill.","American policies toward Asians reached a nadir in 1924, with the implementation of a law that sought 'to preserve the idea of American homogeneity' and denied admission to the country to most non-whites. Immigration from Asia was banned completely, with the establishment of an 'Asiatic Barred Zone.'","I immigrated to the United States in 2001 for college.","I had a thick accent, and people didn't understand me, and I was ashamed, and I fumbled. I radiated an uncertain energy; sometimes baristas sensed this and wouldn't try to talk to me, and then an insecure voice in my head would cry, 'He's racist!'","The Hindu nationalists see a religion near perfection save for the tampering of Muslims and Christians. So they fall upon these groups, rather than try to reform their own practices by drawing on India's sophisticated philosophical traditions.","I see flaws as a kind of beauty.","I travelled around small-town India a lot for a job from 2010-2012, and I was impressed by the energy I encountered in these places.","I met a number of young, striving, enterprising people in cities like Aligarh and Hubli. But the mental landscape of these towns is out of sync with their reality. Many of these towns are hellholes.","I remember returning to Bangalore after a few months of travel and seeing it as a first-world city, like New York or San Francisco. This may be obvious to some people, but I grew up in Delhi, and I had no experience of how someone from a 'Tier 2' city may view a 'Tier 1' city. You really do emigrate between worlds when you come from those towns.","Literature has become too psychological.","We discount the physical, when, in fact, much of life is physical. People's personalities are partly formed by, or in response to, how they take up space; the physical mask has some relation, howsoever obscure, to the mental work happening underneath.","I tend to see my characters from inside and outside at once; this is a technique I use to retain a slight distance. It means my characters can act in unexpected ways on two axes: physical and mental. It isn't just, 'I thought this and then I did this,' which is the technique of the modern psychological novel.","Muslims remain the most convenient target for prejudice in a city like Delhi, which is far more ghettoized than Bombay or Bangalore, for example.","When I lived in Delhi, it was burdened with so many futures - fast roads, malls, flyovers - that one felt almost obliged to be hopeful. Now that hope has diminished, you can feel the city going into a frenzy to reinvent itself. I miss living there.","Getting some distance allowed me to develop a hunger for India and to come back and explore it in a way I wouldn't have had I been living here. And that probably made me more political as well.","I think there is a chance that Indian writers in America will start producing very interesting books in the years to come.","Apparently, the city of Delhi is a 'character' in my novels. I'd argue that it's a ... city... in my novels.","I'm good at description and imparting flow to a story, but I don't necessarily understand the value of long scenes.","I put my thoughts in a book, which must mean I don't want anyone to read them.","When you've finished reading every last thing by a famous writer, literary convention holds that you move on to his or her letters, the DVD extras peddled by publishers.","Cobain the writer is funny and self-aware and snotty with a knack for off-the-cuff profundity. Remarking to a friend that his band will be called 'Nirvana,' he scribbles next to it the words 'Oooh eerie mystical doom.'","Novelists get to say plenty in their massive tomes; rock singers only get four-minute songs with two verses and a chorus' worth of lyrics, and so there's a real pleasure in accessing the intelligence behind the music, even if it doesn't qualify as 'great literature.'","I lived in Brooklyn from 2007 to 2012 but for the last few years have resided in Austin, Texas, where my world - especially the world of downtown - is predominantly white.","New York City has no need to move on from 9/11 because, in a sense, it moved on days after, moments after.","There is not one New York but thousands - mixed-up conurbations and microclimates with their own internal logics and charms, dreams and juxtapositions, faces and tongues.","To live in New York is to see the world as it is to come.","The thing about a failure is that it is possible to deny it forever.","When I had worked on my first book, I had readily shown bits and pieces to everyone - for encouragement, to force myself to write.","In the five months I wrote the final draft of 'The Association of Small Bombs,' I never fell out of the book. The world was real to me: plausible and powerful.","By 2013, at the age of 29, I was failing. I had left two good jobs in succession to complete a novel I'd been tooling around with since 2009, had enrolled in a graduate programme in Texas, as far away from home as possible, to finish it - and yet: what did I have to show for it after five years of work?","I think people have turned terrorists into these larger-than-life devils and so are unable to write about them in the obvious way, which is as human, petty, bumbling.","In some ways, the best novel about terrorism, though it's not a novel, is 'The Looming Tower' by Lawrence Wright or 'Perfect Soldiers' by Terry McDermott.","It's getting worse under Prime Minister Modi. The economic miracle has failed, to a degree, and people are reaching back to a kind of imagined Hindu past for a feeling of pride. And that feeling of pride necessarily comes from denying any kind of Muslim heritage. People my age seem to be becoming illiberal in a way that I'm surprised by.","If India hadn't become a troubled space for me, somehow I wouldn't have any reason to write about it. So the fact that it's a lost love, or something, is why I keep thinking about it obsessively.","Every time a blast happens, people ask, 'But why would someone do this?' Weirdly, it hasn't been answered well anywhere - neither in fiction nor non-fiction.","Terrorists are as torn as anyone else.","Terrorists are people, too - they are given to error. Naipaul and then DeLillo do a good job in their novels of drawing this out: I'm thinking of DeLillo's contention in 'Mao II' that terrorists have replaced writers as the people who 'alter the inner-life of the culture.' I thought that was marvellous!","Terrorists have goals beyond their supposed pacts with God. They are authors, too.","I think that a lot of terrorists have been middle class and, more surprisingly, many of them have been people who were not directly affected by the things they're angry about.","People love talking about the banality of evil and the fact that ordinary people do bad things. I actually want to stay away from that."],"Karan Patel":["I am blessed with a funny gene that makes me enjoy life.","The funniest memory that I can recall about my school days has to be one incident that involved unfinished homework for numerous days. I didn't do any of my homework for days and days at a stretch, and kept stalling my teacher that I was extremely unwell and was under heavy medication.","I don't go by or change my attitude based on what people say. At the end of the day, they, too, are judging me from their perspective. I would rather be myself and let people accept me for what I am than be somebody who I am not, just because I want people's approval.","If you want to be loved, keep your head on your shoulders and feet on the ground. There is nothing wrong in that. I do the same, and others should also follow this motto.","My life is an open book. You're welcome to speculate.","At the end of the day, you entertain for few hours, but people remember a good human being for a longer time.","Atmosphere on the sets of 'YHM' is absolutely brilliant. It's kind of picnic always, and we have a gala time shooting together.","I think one needs a companion at some point in life.","I am known to wear my heart on my sleeves.","Ankita is the best wife and the best companion I could ever get.","I express myself the way I want. Sometimes, I know, I do put up posts that might be insensitive, but I am not someone who deletes a post. If my posts end up hurting people, I don't have any qualms apologising, and I have done that in the past.","You cannot go far alone. You enjoy your journey better if you have people by your side.","My ideal woman would be someone with both beauty and intelligence. Someone who can hold her own in a conversation, gets along with my family and respects elders, loves children, and have a sense of humour as whacky as mine.","I am quite a fitness freak. I may not have the time to sleep, but a workout is a must. I have even set up a small personal gym on the sets.","My diet is high on protein, which keeps me energised and fresh.","There have been times when I have goofed up, and like every adolescent, I sometimes did get led the wrong way. I would come back home really scared to face my mom's wrath and anger, but surprisingly, I never got to face one. She would always tell me in a very nice manner that what I did was wrong and that I should correct myself.","My fitness instructor helped me with strength training, muscle building, and toning.","People might be surprised because I settled for an arranged marriage, but that's what's chosen for us.","I respect people's feelings when they say they love me, but it is completely their choice of expression, and I am alien to it. People have a right to express, but that's it.","I do a lot of weight training, and my workouts are intense, which include cardios, core body workouts, and functional training.","Adopting this lifestyle and opting to exercise has helped me a lot in life.","It is a proud moment for any male actor to have thousands of females chasing you.","I am a celebrity, and it feels good to be famous.","People are sensible enough to know who's dragging my name in dirt for publicity.","Shah Rukh Khan started his career with television, and now he is a superstar. You can't generalise and say that TV actors can't make it to films.","I've always loved the media and will continue to do so, but I do feel with due respect to all concerned that surrounding us and giving us no space to move becomes difficult when you're out with family.","It's just sad that one's attitude is always speculated, even if you've not done something.","Just because I am a celebrity doesn't mean I can't say, 'Sorry.'","Once in a while I do put up a video or a thank you tweet for my fans. I think our interaction cements our bond. Getting so much love from them makes me feel blessed.","The audiences know their actors. Didn't Shah Rukh Khan have a romantic image despite playing a dad in 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai?'","If I was constantly on TV, people would get bored of me.","Giving a break to yourself and the audience, once in a while, is good.","London has always been my favourite city. I visit it almost every other year.","I have always been misunderstood.","People will bring up all kinds of masala, but all that matters to me are my fans. They are my strength. I am overwhelmed by their support and love. It just pays off for all the hard work you put in.","I don't belong to the slums, but to play Naru in 'City Of Gold,' I had to live for months in a real chawl before we shot the film.","My trainer ensures I eat right and balance out in between my hectic shoot schedule.","There is something like destiny. I don't really care if people doubt or express shock over whether our marriage will work.","Success is a collective job, and one can't claim the credit for themselves.","I always try to balance life by thinking failure of any kind, be it relationship or any project, should not affect me as an individual.","My role model has been Shah Rukh Khan. There is something or the other for one to learn from his career.","I was a kid when I did the hit show 'Kasturi' in 2007. Maybe stardom went to my head and I thought I was bigger than I actually was. I took everything for granted.","We don't get offered roles because of who we are but because of what we delivered in the past.","For me, stardom means when people know your name when you appear on screen.","I don't think I am a very big star on TV.","I am an actor, and that's the most important thing to me. I cannot imagine a life where I would be anything else but an actor, so putting all my energy into a shot comes naturally to me.","I am a different person in front of the camera; it comes as easy to me as breathing does.","Any common man can relate to the story that 'Ye Hai Mohabbatein' has.","My fans have always been supportive during my highs and lows. They have been the best set of fans, ever.","My mom has always been beside me, always telling me what's right and what's not, guiding me through it all, keeping me away from bad company and from bad habits.","My mother has always kept the entire family together - my dad, due to his business, has always been travelling, and hence, she at times had to play the role of a father and a mother as well.","I have had my share of choices and temptations, too; I would not lie about that. And I would also like to confess that had it not been for my mother, I would probably have never been able to make the right decisions during those formative years of my life.","When I will be with the perfect girl at the perfect place, that would be a perfect date for me.","My job is to act, so I just focus on that.","For any actor, it's very important to make your co-star comfortable.","There was a time when I had no work, and I had to sit at home for 4 years.","I used to think I was a big star. And I used to think that the TV industry, Balaji, and my show will not survive without me. But then I realised that you cannot be bigger than your work.","Off-screen, I am the most outgoing and friendly person.","I don't like people lying; I like honesty.","I always wanted to be an actor, so I began to prepare myself for a career in acting. I did a course at Kishore Namit Kapoor's acting school. I was with Shiamak Davar's dance school and also did theatre with Nadira Babbar.","I am from Mumbai. I studied at the Utpal Sanghvi School at Juhu and then went to the Mithibai College. I come from a business family, and I am the only son.","I understand that people have aspirations, and everyone wants to play the lead role. But, I do believe that one must climb the ladder from the first step."],"Karan Singh Grover":["There are co-ed schools in Saudi, but those are American or British. My dad, of course, believed in the good old CBSE Indian school system and thus, my younger brother Ishmeet and I were put in an all-boys CBSE school. My mother could move out only if she wore a burkha.","Saudi had been a very restricted place. Even on the magazines there, if there was a little leg or cleavage showing, they used to blacken it with a black mark. Me and Ishmeet, so many times, had tried to remove the black portion with our spit, but of course, it would never come out.","If I had my way, I wouldn't be sharing my personal life online. I'm a private person. At home, I don't wander around shirtless, flexing my muscles. I roam around unshaven, with my hair disheveled. Unfortunately, people perceive you differently. It's okay; they're free to speculate.","I am flirtatious by nature, but I have never hurt anyone.","I grew up watching Salman Khan and Arnold Schwarzenegger, who have always juggled fitness with acting. In real life, I'm a fitness freak. Besides, it is nice to look at an actor who is fit, and if you become a role model, that's a perk.","I am originally a surd who was born in Delhi in 1982, just two years before the Sikh riots, so all my childhood pictures are in baby frocks with ponytails, as my parents wanted to hide the fact that I was a Sikh boy, given the riots. My dad worked for a travel agency, and we soon moved to Saudi Arabia.","Both me and Ishmeet were very naughty. We used to have my grandfather's swords in the house. We used to take all these swords and take all the showpieces Mom had and slice them one by one. He actually locked my nana in the kitchen once for two hours.","My character Saurabh Singhania is a rich, bad guy who is driven by revenge, so much that you feel like scratching his face or throwing stones at him. The intimate scenes in the trailer are creating quite a buzz... I wish they had shown more of the story instead of the sizzling scenes. The film is not about boldness or intimacy.","As actors, we need to do our parts exactly the way they have visualised it, because if we don't, we have to keep doing it many times over.","Hate is a very strong and heavy emotion, probably as strong as love. I don't think I can live with hatred. If something bad happens, you feel bad about it; you forgive and move on. There's no hatred.","Why are we tiptoeing on glass? You can ask me whatever you like; people usually do, and I try to be as honest as I can.","I came to Mumbai in 2000 to do a hotel management course. Following this, I worked as a marketing executive with Hotel Sheraton in Muscat for a year. It was in 2004 that I participated in the Gladrags Mr. India contest and bagged the most popular model award. After that, I did few ramp shows and ads.","I am just like Dr. Armaan - fun-loving, flirtatious, and tension-free. I am serious about my work, but apart from that, I am always playing pranks on people. As a viewer, I relate more to 'Dil Mill Gayye.'","I love to sing. I also had a band during my college days in Saudi Arabia called Thousand Decibels. If not an actor, I would have become a singer. I am very passionate about work. I am a fitness freak: I go to gym before doing my shoot. I also do yoga.","I think there are only two kinds of heroes: the flamboyant ones and the angry-yet-silent types. Every character on TV falls into either category.","I would love to work with Shilpa again. But it would have to be for 'Dill Mill Gayye (DMG)' - that's the only fiction show I'll take up on small screen. I'm extremely faithful to that show. That apart, I'm not likely to do anymore fiction on TV for the time being.","As an individual, I need space and can't be locked in a house with strangers. I would do 'Bigg Boss' if I get to co-host it with Salman Khan.","I am not against any kind of physical intimacy on screen, but kissing is a big no unless it's with Jennifer. I'd like to kiss her on-screen as we do it at home, too. If we get paid for it, that's even better.","There was a scene in 'Qubool Hai' where Asad shoots his father. After shooting for it, I was drained completely. At times, my character's mood gets very depressing. Post shoot, it takes a good half hour to get out of character, to leave Asad behind.","Each person's body type is different, and they need to understand that food should be eaten in regular portions.","I want to play someone really dark, like a real bad guy on screen. But I am sure I won't be able to do so because my fans will not let me do it. They are aggressive. My image is such that no one will allow me to do a negative character.","I really liked the script of 'Alone.' I thought there were a lot unexpected things in the film, which I would want to watch as a viewer. I did not think like I was doing a horror film; I did not think in terms of genre. I decided on the basis of the script.","I quit 'Qubool Hai' at the right time. When 'Alone' was offered to me, I was learning production and direction. I don't think not being seen on TV for more than a year will affect my popularity or 'Alone.'","TV is like a school. It is easy to shoot for a film. In movies, you have a definite start and end. You know your character is there for a particular period."],"Kareem Abdul-Jabbar":["You can't win unless you learn how to lose.","I think that the good and the great are only separated by the willingness to sacrifice.","When I was 17, I worked in a mentoring program in Harlem designed to improve the community. That's when I first gained an appreciation of the Harlem Renaissance, a time when African-Americans rose to prominence in American culture. For the first time, they were taken seriously as artists, musicians, writers, athletes, and as political thinkers.","Jackie Robinson, as an athlete and as someone who was trying to make a stand for equality, he was exemplary.","Black people don't have an accurate idea of their history, which has been either suppressed or distorted.","I'm still my parent's child, I'm still me, but I made a choice. I evolved into Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. I think it has to do with evolution.","One man can be a crucial ingredient on a team, but one man cannot make a team.","In athletics there's always been a willingness to cheat if it looks like you're not cheating. I think that's just a quirk of human nature.","If not shown appreciation, it gets to you.","I think someone should explain to the child that it's OK to make mistakes. That's how we learn. When we compete, we make mistakes.","I am highly offended by the total lack of acknowledgement of my contribution to Laker success.","The extra pass and the extra effort on defense always get the job done.","I think the NBA players have to be held accountable in a reasonable way, just like any other professionals.","LeBron James can get a shot off under any and all circumstances and he makes them.","I'm the baddest among the bad guys.","Five guys on the court working together can achieve more than five talented individuals who come and go as individuals.","I try to do the right thing at the right time. They may just be little things, but usually they make the difference between winning and losing.","I saw Islam as the correct way to live, and I chose to try to live that way.","The word 'leukemia' is a very frightening word. In many instances, it's a killer and it's something that you have to deal with in a very serious and determined way if you're going to beat it.","A lot of young players don't really know much about the history of the game and a lot of them are missing out on what the game is all about, especially the whole concept of sportsmanship and teamwork.","The type of leukemia that I am dealing with is treatable. So if I do what my doctors tell me to do - get my blood checked regularly, take my meds and consult with my doctor and follow any additional instructions he might make - I will be able to maintain my good health and live my life with a minimum of disruptions to my lifestyle.","Islam is about finding your own space.","Fundamental preparation is always effective. Work on those parts of your game that are fundamentally weak.","Great players are willing to give up their own personal achievement for the achievement of the group. It enhances everybody.","High school dropouts are forfeiting their opportunity to pursue the American Dream.","My biggest accomplishment has been making a transition from athlete to author.","This is what I would have done if I had to have a real job: I would have been a history teacher.","I would suggest that teachers show their students concrete examples of the negative effects of the actions that gangsta rappers glorify.","A team will always appreciate a great individual if he's willing to sacrifice for the group.","I enjoy seeing new places.","You can't win if you don't play as a unit.","I want people to understand that I intend to continue living and doing all the things that I love to do up until the end. And the end is by no means rushing up on me.","When the line started to blur between the fans and the players, sometimes things can get ugly.","It's hard for young players to see the big picture. They just see three or four years down the road.","I think the NBA will certainly survive without Michael Jordan.","I think race has been a burden for black Americans. Being Muslim has also been a challenge because so many people do not understand Islam.","I feel that there has been progress made since I was a boy on matters of race, but we have a long way to go.","My most memorable moment came in 1985 as we beat the Boston Celtics.","Music is really something that makes people whole.","I'm not exaggerating when I say that the 761st was Patton's best tank unit and nobody knew about it.","Michael Jordan and Magic and myself all learned how to play the game in college programs that emphasized the team.","In a typical history book, black Americans are mentioned in the context of slavery or civil rights. There's so much more to the story.","Your mind is what makes everything else work.","I'm not comfortable being preachy, but more people need to start spending as much time in the library as they do on the basketball court.","You have to be able to center yourself, to let all of your emotions go... Don't ever forget that you play with your soul as well as your body.","When I was a kid, no one would believe anything positive that you could say about black people. That's a terrible burden.","I didn't really seek attention. I just wanted to play the game well and go home.","I'm not going to disappear.","As brilliant an individual that Michael Jordan was, he was not successful until he got with a good team unit.","I expect more people from China and Asia to end up in the NBA.","I felt that a number of people might have questioned my loyalty, but I continue to be a patriotic American.","My choosing Islam was not a political statement; it was a spiritual statement.","I have been coaching recently. I coached high school basketball in Arizona, and I hope that more opportunities become available.","I wanted to play baseball!","The transition was difficult. It's hard to stop something that you've enjoyed and that has been very rewarding.","The game has basically not changed since I ended my career.","As a parent, I have a job as a role model to my children, and by extension, to other young people.","I think black Americans expect too much from individual black Americans in terms of changing the status quo.","I listen to jazz mainly. Mainstream jazz.","I hope to be involved in a successful movie script.","When we went up against teams that were better, I just hoped that we could steal the victories.","I tell kids to pursue their basketball dreams, but I tell them to not let that be their only dream.","I think I did very well against everyone who tried to defend me.","Center is a very tough position to play.","I can do something else besides stuff a ball through a hoop. My biggest resource is my mind.","My mother had to send me to the movies with my birth certificate, so that I wouldn't have to pay the extra fifty cents that the adults had to pay.","I rooted for the Dodgers when they were in Brooklyn.","I did a book in 1996, an overview of black history. In that process I became more aware of a lot of the black inventors of the 19th century.","Sports and entertainment are the only places where inner-city kids see themselves being able to succeed. Their intellectual development is something they don't relate to.","Music rhythms are mathematical patterns. When you hear a song and your body starts moving with it, your body is doing math. The kids in their parents' garage practicing to be a band may not realize it, but they're also practicing math.","My health is fine.","I have always thought that writers come with any variety of attributes. Some are capable and some aren't.","I always thought I could do a good job coaching, but the opportunities have not presented themselves.","When the doctor told me I had cancer, I was scared.","My grandfather and my uncle both died from colorectal cancer, my dad almost died from it and I have the gene for it.","Yoga is just good for you.","I've always tried to stay out of the fray and not be an object of controversy.","The '80s made up for all the abuse I took during the '70s. I outlived all my critics. By the time I retired, everybody saw me as a venerable institution. Things do change."],"Kareena Kapoor Khan":["Life is full of happiness and tears; be strong and have faith.","My professional life has nothing to do with my personal life and vice versa.","Once, in a magazine interview, I said the difference between shoe ladies and bag ladies is that shoe ladies are just a bit classier. Finished! That started World War III among all the women I knew. I only meant that shoes do more for your look and body than bags do!","I don't take success and failure seriously. The only thing I do seriously is march forward. If I fall, I get up and march again.","I do my own thing. And I believe what I do is the right thing.","My co-stars call me selfish. They say, 'You are only interested in yourself and what you are only interested is yourself and what you are doing in front of the camera.' I reply, 'I can't help it; it's what got me where I am.'","I am not a home breaker and I can never be. I haven't been brought up to create havoc in other people's homes.","I believe in the institution of marriage and it's like a tag to cement the relationship for your friends, family and public.","If I want to kiss, I shall kiss. If I am told that a lovemaking scene is integral to the script, I will consider it.","Frankly, we actresses are so much in a hurry. We feel we have very few years to shine in our career, so we neglect our personal life. But for me, both aspects are equally important. I don't want to grow old and have regrets.","I don't know why people feel that I am snooty. I am not a person who has ever given an interview on image building. I have never been that person, as I am very confident of what I do. People do PR, but I get completely foxed. I don't know how to do it. I stay away from the limelight, as I think my work should speak on my behalf.","In 2007, my life changed forever. I signed on 'Tashan,' a full-on glamorous masala movie, with two of the hottest and fittest actors around: Akshay Kumar and Saif Ali Khan. And me, rising out of the sea like a Bond girl, wearing nothing but a green bikini. I had nightmares of how my love handles would be on display for the whole world to see.","A lot of guys try to mingle with me because of who I am. If I encounter a guy with a clean heart, I will go by my instincts. I guess my man won't be from the film industry.","My thinking is lot more different with many actresses in the industry. I don't understand why people in showbiz put their profession of acting in the back seat after marriage.","You are as old as you look. If you are fit and pretty at an X age, why won't filmmakers want to cast you, whether you are married or not?","I eat only simple Indian home food - sabzi, roti, dal, chawal, ghee. There are so many benefits of having ghee. My grandmother is 84 and she is still fit and looks beautiful.","'Ek Main Aur Ek Tu' was a very special film for me. Imran and we complement each other very well. He is sugar, and I am spice.","I never really do much research before signing a film. It is just the script and character that I concentrate on.","My parents are very modern. My father is a cosmopolitan person. He always supported the fact that I will be an actress. There is nothing else I would do rather than being an actor.","I am passionate about acting. 'Girls in our family are not allowed to act' is quite an outdated thought to have. They did it till my mother, but now no more.","Be it a village or a city, education is very important, and it always comes into you.","It is important to be well read, at least a little bit.","I want a man I can keep for myself. I wouldn't ever share my man with anyone else.","I started my career with 'Refugee' in Bhuj. Now, it has become a full-fledged city.","Films don't decide my whole life. They are just a part of who I am. What I do in my personal life should be of no concern to the filmmakers or the fans.","'Heroine' is about a declining and imbalanced superstar - a very brave and bold role. I wanted to test whether I could carry a role like this. I have given 200 per cent to this role. She's a very complex character, very aggressive, manipulative and bold, yet she's very fragile.","Actors are greedy. They can never be satisfied. I want praise as well as box office returns.","It's a political and manipulative industry. Actors vie for the same roles, movies are snatched away. Have I ever been manipulated? Yes. But I haven't manipulated anyone because if you think from the heart, you cannot be calculative. I have spent nights crying.","It's unarguable that the right shoes can really add elegance to an outfit and to the person who's wearing them. Take a pair of high heels, for instance. Suddenly, you're looking taller, shoulders back, body curved.","Yoga may look peaceful and calming, but even Arnold Schwarzenegger would have trouble breathing after twenty 'surya namaskars' in a row.","I think a woman looks best in a sari.","One should eat everything especially healthy and not junk food. I don't like the idea of starving. I would eat and burn it out in gym. The amount of intake is what matters."],"Karel Capek":["My dear Miss Glory, Robots are not people. They are mechanically more perfect than we are, they have an astounding intellectual capacity, but they have no soul.","Any acceleration constitutes progress, Miss Glory. Nature had no understanding of the modern rate of work. From a technical standpoint the whole of childhood is pure nonsense. Simply wasted time. An untenable waste of time.","Robots do not hold on to life. They can't. They have nothing to hold on with - no soul, no instinct. Grass has more will to live than they do.","Relativism is not indifference; on the contrary, passionate indifference is necessary in order for you not to hear the voices that oppose your absolute decrees.","One never knows whether people have principles on principle or whether for their own personal satisfaction.","Nothing is stranger to man than his own image.","You still stand watch, O human star, burning without a flicker, perfect flame, bright and resourceful spirit. Each of your rays a great idea - O torch which passes from hand to hand, from age to age, world without end.","Robots of the world, you are ordered to exterminate the human race. Do not spare the men. Do not spare the women. Preserve only the factories, railroads, machines, mines, and raw materials. Destroy everything else. Then return to work. Work must not cease.","Wherever on this planet ideals of personal freedom and dignity apply, there you will find the cultural inheritance of England.","If dogs could talk, perhaps we would find it as hard to get along with them as we do with people.","Relativism is neither a method of fighting, nor a method of creating, for both of these are uncompromising and at times even ruthless; rather, it is a method of cognition.","Cognition is not fighting, but once someone knows a lot, he will have much to fight for, so much that he will be called a relativist because of it.","Art must not serve might.","You can have a revolution wherever you like, except in a government office; even were the world to come to an end, you'd have to destroy the universe first and then government offices.","I've found a place that would amaze you. People used to live there, but now it's all overgrown and no one goes there. Absolutely no one - only me... Just a little house and a garden. And two dogs.","Man will never be enslaved by machinery if the man tending the machine be paid enough.","Be these people either Conservatives or Socialists, Yellows or Reds, the most important thing is - and that is the point I want to stress - that all of them are right in the plain and moral sense of the word.","Socialism is good when it comes to wages, but it tells me nothing when it comes to other questions in life that are more private and painful, for which I must seek answers elsewhere.","If one must fight or create, it is necessary that this be preceded by the broadest possible knowledge.","Much melancholy has devolved upon mankind, and it is detestable to me that might will triumph in the end.","Great God of the Ants, thou hast granted victory to thy servants. I appoint thee honorary Colonel.","I certainly don't know if you could claim that every theft is wrong, but I'll prove to you that every theft is forbidden, by simply locking you up.","People should be a little loony, Helena. That's the best thing about them.","There came into the world an unlimited abundance of everything people need. But people need everything except unlimited abundance.","It was a great thing to be a human being. It was something tremendous. Suddenly I'm conscious of a million sensations buzzing in me like bees in a hive. Gentlemen, it was a great thing."],"Karel Reisz":["Heroism in a bad cause.","I will only speak off the record about Debra Winger.","Minority views expressed in films simply don't sell tickets.","I'm now beginning to feel that the pessimistic vision is not for the movies.","A big element of what they regard as conformity is simply a desire to have an audience.","The British cinema had been very dull and conformist.","A style is not a matter of camera angles or fancy footwork, it's an expression, an accurate expression of your particular opinion.","There's a great danger in making this seem more important than it is, this whole Free Cinema thing.","I said I would do all the films about the commercials, and the films about ball-bearings and Ford tractors and so on, if once a year they gave me money for a free film."],"Karen Abbott":["Female spies typically represented one of two extremes: the seductress who employed her wiles to manipulate men, and the cross-dresser who blended in by impersonating them.","Before the Great Chicago Fire, no one took notice of Patrick and Catherine O'Leary, two Irish immigrants who lived with their five children on the city's West Side.","In 2001, I moved from Philly to Atlanta, where I lived for six years. I had never lived anywhere but Philly, and you can imagine the culture shock; the Civil War seeps into daily life and conversation down South in a way it never does up North.","As a kid, I liked to write, but I didn't think that was a viable career choice. My dream, actually, was to be a white girl rapper and join Salt-N-Pepa - which obviously was a much more viable career choice.","I think the most important thing journalism taught me is to mine for details. The details are key. You can't try to be funny or strange or poignant; you have to let the details be funny or strange or poignant for you.","Vaudeville was characterized by sunny optimism, acts that were uplifting, cheerful, and clean. It provided a fanciful, magical escape, but after Black Friday, the tone of American entertainment changed almost overnight.","I don't consider 'American Rose' to be a biography so much as a microcosm of 20th-century America, told through Gypsy's tumultuous life - it's 'Horatio Alger meets Tim Burton.'","In the beginning of the war, Southern women wanted their men to leave - in droves, and as quickly as possible. They were the Confederate Army's most persuasive and effective recruitment officers, shaming anyone who shirked his duty to fight.","In the sudden absence of husbands, fathers, brothers and beaus, white Southern women discovered a newfound freedom - one that simultaneously granted them more power in relationships and increased their likelihood of heartbreak.","At least in cities where the Confederate Army established a base of operations, young women were overwhelmed by the number of prospective suitors. Thousands of men flocked to the Confederate capital of Richmond, prepared to work in one of the government departments or to train for duty in the Army.","By 1865, all Southern women - the happily and regrettably single, the perpetually engaged, the wives and widows - had tired of the war. The Confederacy was shrinking, and the morale of its remaining men shrinking with it.","The ideas and practices of Franz Anton Mesmer, an 18th-century Australian healer, had spread to the United States and, by the 1840s, held the country in thrall. Mesmer proposed that everything in the universe, including the human body, was governed by a 'magnetic fluid' that could become imbalanced, causing illness.","I wasn't really a dark kid, but I was in my head a lot. I got good grades all through my 16 years of Catholic school, but I was always writing these weird - and, I have to say, really bad - stories, filled with murder.","I had spent five years not earning a penny, getting rejected. Thank God I had a husband who was supportive and encouraging. But I still said to myself, 'If the Everleighs doesn't sell, I'm finished with writing forever.' I was going to get an office job.","America's first Olympics may have been its worst, or at least its most bizarre."],"Karen Allen":["Idleness does drive me crazy, but I'd rather read or write than do anything just to work. A kind of respect has been instilled in me for acting: I love it too much to ever have a bad relationship with it.","I've always done things the hard way. I was born like a piece of tangled yarn. The job is trying to untangle it, and I'll probably go on doing it for the rest of my life.","I'm about as healthy as a person can be. I quit smoking seven or eight years ago.","I loved living and breathing theatre so much that I decided I had to find a way to bring my desire to act and my ability to support myself together. I'd run through the possibilities in Washington, so that meant moving to New York.","Eventually you love people - friends or lovers - because of their flaws.","I've never done anything for money. My first love is things of limited commercial appeal. I could be happy doing Shakespeare for the rest of my life.","I don't know if I've ever played a character who's close to me. There have been some elements of myself in different roles. Sometimes, I show one side of myself and then completely conceal the other.","As far as acting in films, there is not much out there that is very interesting to do. The ones that are interesting to me are independent films and they have trouble raising money. With people putting their money into blockbusters, there is not much left for the independents.","Let's just say I decided that while my son is young I don't want to do projects that would take me away for months.","I said to myself, 'I've waited a long time in my life to have a child, and I'm missing it, I want to continue to have a career, but not this way.'","I find myself really feeling like it's possible that maybe the greater contribution I'm going to be able to make through this next phase of my life might be as a writer writing wonderful parts for women, or even writing wonderful parts for myself, you know?","You know, I don't really understand a suburban environment. I want to be out in the woods, I want to be where it's wild, I want to wake up and hear birds, I want to walk outside and see a gaggle of turkeys bouncing across my lawn - I want to be someplace like that - or I want to be right in the middle of an urban environment.","I don't necessarily like being defined by my profession.","A lot of times when I've been offered film series and stuff, if they shoot in Los Angeles, I lose interest.","The secrecy thing has gotten to be more and more prevalent in films, and maybe that's good. It's nice to go see a film and not know anything about it. Sometimes I feel like we know too much about films.","My son was born somewhat late in my life and I just found myself really feeling like I didn't want to miss out on being a parent and being with him, and not wanting a situation where I was constantly pulled back and forth between being present, and having all these other pressures and considerations.","I thought, I need to reinvent myself. I want every day of life to be wonderful, fascinating, interesting, creative. And what am I gonna do to make that happen?","If there are no other wonderful roles that come my way, I have a quite an interesting, dynamic life.","I feel as though I would be delighted to come back into working in the film world, and working in the theater world again. I'm just gonna see what happens.","There's something so wonderful about being an actor in New York.","People want to see a movie that casts a mature woman across from a mature man.","I'm from a generation of fantastic actresses. It's a big pool of really wonderful actresses, and so many of them we never even get to see on the screen anymore.","I just felt like I had to create a life for myself where I was more independent."],"Karen Armstrong":["Jesus did not spend a great deal of time discoursing about the trinity or original sin or the incarnation, which have preoccupied later Christians. He went around doing good and being compassionate.","I like silence; I'm a gregarious loner and without the solitude, I lose my gregariousness.","In the holy city of Mecca, violence of any kind was forbidden. From the moment they left home, pilgrims were not permitted to carry weapons, to swat an insect or speak an angry word, a discipline that introduced them to a new way of living.","Mohammed was not an apparent failure. He was a dazzling success, politically as well as spiritually, and Islam went from strength to strength to strength.","Ever since the Crusades, when Christians from western Europe were fighting holy wars against Muslims in the near east, western people have often perceived Islam as a violent and intolerant faith - even though when this prejudice took root Islam had a better record of tolerance than Christianity.","All religions are designed to teach us how to live, joyfully, serenely, and kindly, in the midst of suffering.","Compassion is a practically acquired knowledge, like dancing. You must do it and practice diligently day by day.","Mythology and science both extend the scope of human beings. Like science and technology, mythology, as we shall see, is not about opting out of this world, but about enabling us to live more intensely within it.","At the beginning of the twentieth century, every single leading Muslim intellectual was in love with the west, and wanted their countries to look just like Britain and France.","It's a great event to get outside and enjoy nature. I find it very exciting no matter how many times I see bald eagles.","The hajj is one of the five essential practices of Islam; when they make the pilgrimage to Mecca, Muslims ritually act out the central principles of their faith.","Religious people often prefer to be right rather than compassionate. Often, they don't want to give up their egotism. They want their religion to endorse their ego, their identity.","Compassion is the key in Islam and Buddhism and Judaism and Christianity. They are profoundly similar.","Alas, all traditions lose their primal purity and we all fail our founders.","Religion is a search for transcendence. But transcendence isn't necessarily sited in an external god, which can be a very unspiritual, unreligious concept.","If we want to create a viable, peaceful world, we've got to integrate compassion into the gritty realities of 21st century life.","But human beings fall easily into despair, and from the very beginning we invented stories that enabled us to place our lives in a larger setting, that revealed an underlying pattern, and gave us a sense that, against all the depressing and chaotic evidence to the contrary, life had meaning and value.","Religions have always stressed that compassion is not only central to religious life, it is the key to enlightenment and it the true test of spirituality. But there have always have been those who'd rather put easier goals, like doctrine conformity, in place.","Well, logos is science or reason, something that helps us to function practically and effectively in the world, and it must therefore be closely in tune and reflect accurately the realities of the world around us.","A theology should be like poetry, which takes us to the end of what words and thoughts can do.","Today we often think that before we start living a religious life we have first to accept the creedal doctrines and that before one can have any comprehension of the loyalty and trust of faith, one must first force one's mind to accept a host of incomprehensible doctrines. But this is to put the cart before the horse.","Today mythical thinking has fallen into disrepute; we often dismiss it as irrational and self-indulgent. But the imagination is also the faculty that has enabled scientists to bring new knowledge to light and to invent technology that has made us immeasurably more effective.","Compassion is not a popular virtue.","Ironically, the first thing that appealed to me about Islam was its pluralism. The fact that the Koran praises all the great prophets of the past.","For centuries, the Muslims were able to co-exist perfectly well with Jews and Christians in the Middle East.","Well, the idea of God as a supreme being means that he is simply like us, writ large, and just bigger and better, the end product of the series; whereas this divine personality that we meet in the Bible was, for centuries, regarded simply as a symbol of a greater transcendence that lay beyond it.","The first person to promulgate the Golden Rule, which was the bedrock of this empathic spirituality, was Confucius 500 years before Christ.","We are addicted to our egotism, our likes and dislikes and prejudices, and depend upon them for our own sense of identity.","After I left the convent, for 15 years I was worn out with religion, I wanted nothing whatever to do with it. I felt disgusted with it. If I saw someone reading a religious book on a train, I'd think, how awful.","Every fundamentalist movement I've studied in Judaism, Christianity and Islam is convinced at some gut, visceral level that secular liberal society wants to wipe out religion.","Fundamentalists are not friends of democracy. And that includes your fundamentalists in the United States.","Islam is a religion of success. Unlike Christianity, which has as its main image, in the west at least, a man dying in a devastating, disgraceful, helpless death.","Now I think one of the reasons why religion developed in the way that it did over the centuries was precisely to curb this murderous bent that we have as human beings.","There are some forms of religion that are bad, just as there's bad cooking or bad art or bad sex, you have bad religion too.","The values of Islam are expressed by Muslims clearly. September 11 changed the world, and put Muslims on the spotlight.","Buddhists talk about nirvana in very much the same terms as monotheists describe God.","Compassion is not a popular virtue. Very often when I talk to religious people, and mention how important it is that compassion is the key, that it's the sine-qua-non of religion, people look kind of balked, and stubborn sometimes, as much to say, what's the point of having religion if you can't disapprove of other people?","Yes, all fundamentalists feel that in a secular society, God has been relegated to the margin, to the periphery and they are all in different ways seeking to drag him out of that peripheral position, back to center stage.","There is a danger in monotheism, and it's called idolatry. And we know the prophets of Israel were very, very concerned about idolatry, the worship of a human expression of the divine.","I was a lousy nun. I couldn't do it. I couldn't find God. It wasn't suitable for me. It is suitable for very few people.","I believe in holiness and sacredness in other people. It doesn't mean that the clouds part and I see God. That's a juvenile way of thinking about it.","I am not interested in the afterlife. Religion is supposed to be about losing your ego, not preserving it eternally in optimum conditions.","I have nothing maternal in me, and men want to be mothered a lot of the time.","Even before 9/11 I was gripped by a sense of dread: our lack of criticism about what we were doing in the Middle East - the slagging off of a whole religious tradition.","We have domesticated God's transcendence. We often learn about God at about the same time as we are learning about Santa Claus; but our ideas about Santa Claus change, mature and become more nuanced, whereas our ideas of God can remain at a rather infantile level.","Zionism was originally a rebellion against religious Judaism and the PLO Charter was essentially secularist. But because the conflict was allowed to fester without a resolution, religion got sucked into the escalating cycle of violence and became part of the problem.","In the past some of the most influential Jewish, Christian and Muslim theologians, such as Maimonides, Aquinas and Ibn Sina, made it clear that it was very difficult to speak about God, because when we confront the ultimate, we are at the end of what words or thoughts can do.","Storytelling is fine as long as you can encourage people to act on the stories.","Pain is something that's common to human life. When we ignore it, we aren't engaging in the whole reality, and the pain begins to fester.","Let's use our stories to encourage listening to one another and to hear not just the good news, but also the pain that lies at the back of a lot of people's stories and histories.","Human beings have always been mythmakers.","When violence becomes imbedded in a region, then this affects everything. It affects your dreams, your fantasies and relationships, and your religion becomes violent, too.","Compassion doesn't, of course, mean feeling sorry for people, or pity, which is how the word has become emasculated in a way.","I have a very sharp tongue, I'm very impatient, and it's a lifelong struggle."],"Karen Bass":["It's so much easier to throw rocks than it is to govern.","I have been a lifelong community activist and frankly did not dream of being in public office.","When I was in my early 20s, I studied tae kwon do and hapkido. I earned brown belts in both of them.","You know, I was a community activist, so I'm used to standing out in front of an elected official's office and protesting.","I think that women are much more collaborative; men are much more competitive.","My father was from the South and turned me into a news junkie at a very early age. I would sit and watch TV with him."],"Karen Bender":["Don't monitor your online savings account in real time.","Make pumpkin bread as the default gift for everyone. It is cheap, it is beloved, it is carbs.","I was in graduate school. I had a birth control accident and went to get the morning after pill.","The word inventors have to create a new term to describe how I felt when I learned that 'Refund' was on the shortlist for the Frank O'Connor International Story prize - Excited, thrilled, honored, none of them quite do it.","I wrote lots of pages. I showed what I wrote to Iowa friends, and they said, 'Good start.' That was discouraging because I thought it was almost done.","It's great being married to a writer. You live with someone who can read your work and help you.","My first published work was when I was 19, in 'Playgirl.' It was an odd experience but exciting.","What is it to be normal, at 12, at 78? What is it like when you can't grow up?","Don't go into any store that features shopping bags that can stand on their own accord in the middle of a table. This sort of shopping bag denotes prices that will start chipping into your children's college education fund. Avoid it.","Tell your mother that any clothes she wants to purchase you as a gift has to be suitable for a job interview.","Write something beautiful and honest and that makes you very proud.","Fall into your sentences; enjoy writing them. Love the world you are creating.","Giving shape to a painful experience is powerful because it helps us to see, first, how we got through it; second, how we can share it. The experience doesn't stay trapped within us, unspoken, curdling - instead, the art of arranging and transforming it reduces the burden. It no longer belongs to only you.","When I was 19 and dropped out of college for several months, I lived for some time with my grandmother.","My second novel began after my family moved from New York City to North Carolina, and I watched my son walk into kindergarten at a school in which he was the only Jewish child out of 600 students - and this in the middle of the Bible Belt.","Writing about a person whose struggle you wish you could solve is an act of compassion and also, frankly, opportunism.","Write a story a great writer would write. Because part of becoming an artist is pushing through all the disbelief of those around you, deciding that you are a writer when you have no idea what a plot is or whether what you've written is any good, or anything.","At one point, I had a story accepted at the 'New Yorker,' which sent off weird bells in people when I told them - 'Oh,' they thought, 'now you are a writer' - where I really had been for the last 30-odd years.","You sit at your computer for hours, then slave away at your job that you may or may not like. You don't know how to explain to them that the time when you feel alive or present is when you are writing.","When I wrote my stories in elementary school, I signed them all 'Karen E. Bender' with the squiggly 'E.' I wanted, from an early age, to be a writer, and that name - that E - was a way of pretending I knew how to do it."],"Karen Black":["There is no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.","I've been invited to do a trio with a fantastic jazz guitarist and a harmonica player.","Illiteracy is rampant. People are out of communication.","I am the least intimidating person. I think I would have done better in my career if I were a little more intimidating. Even the maid who comes to work for me once a week has found out that she can just trample over me... I'm a Cancer! We are not ferocious people.","If you can write it, I can be it.","I dislike when people try to pigeonhole me, when all I want is to do good work.","If you didn't know that I am an actress, I don't think you could tell from my lifestyle. I cook and cook and cook. I like to be with my daughter. She's 16, so of course I bore her.","If I turn on the television, am I to believe that that is America? I'm sorry, I don't believe that's America.","I love playing strong women, even if they're nuts.","I love what I do, so it's not tiring. If I worked at a computer or drove a truck, I'd be dead in a week.","I love coloring books. I keep some by my bed."],"Karen Blixen":["When in the end, the day came on which I was going away, I learned the strange learning that things can happen which we ourselves cannot possibly imagine, either beforehand, or at the time when they are taking place, or afterwards when we look back on them.","If I know a song of Africa, of the giraffe and the African new moon lying on her back, of the plows in the fields and the sweaty faces of the coffee pickers, does Africa know a song of me?"],"Karen Carpenter":["Not enough people in this world are happy.","I enjoy money. Not enough people in this world are happy. I'm determined to be contented, and having plenty of money from working makes it easier for me.","The image we have would be impossible for Mickey Mouse to maintain. We're just... normal people.","It's kinda nice to be remembered by your peers and your fans, because you can achieve a lot of success and be a creep too! But we try to be nice, just normal people.","People never think of entertainers as being human. When you walk out on stage, the audience think, 'Nothing can go wrong with them.' We get sick and we have headaches just like they do. When we are cut, we bleed.","I'm just afraid I'm gonna miss it all... being married... being a mother.","I enjoy money.","I'm determined to be contented, and having plenty of money from working makes it easier for me.","I feel like the health industry is getting nothing but stronger every day.","I have a harder time finding somebody. The problem is we were growing professionally during the years most people were concentrating on being a person."],"Karen Civil":["Don't let the insecurities of others dull your sparkle. Shine like the star you are born to be.","Social media can help or hurt you. People are more into other people's lives than their own. Everyone sees everyone else's success online, and we allow it to magnify our own failure.","I was born to Haitian parents, and the idea of giving back is really just a part of our culture. So, I don't think there was ever a moment that I questioned my call to philanthropy, but I can say that the more I've grown, the bigger that call has become.","I always knew I wanted to do something in entertainment. Since I could not sing, had no rhythm, and did not want to be a baby mama, I thought I would explore the Video DJ route.","While working for Diplomat Records, I helped several artists with their online branding and social media. Once I left the label, I worked directly with artists and noticed many artists were overlooked and underrated if they weren't in 'XXL' or 'The Source.'","When I was in eighth grade, I created a Backstreet Boys fan site. I came in third place in a fan site contest and got to meet them.","In high school, I created a fan group for J.D. Williams, who played Bodie on 'The Wire.' I had the chance to meet him, and he took me to have lunch at IHOP. At that point in my life, I noticed this Internet thing was giving me the chance to check off goals off of my bucket list.","I'm just me. I'm that cool girl who - as I like to say, I have that Carson Daly effect, where, if you watched 'TRL,' he was able to do interviews with NSYNC, blend right in, and then he would do interviews with Cash Money and blend in there, and you just naturally liked him.","I didn't have a resume when Lil Wayne hired me. I didn't have a resume when Beats by Dre flew me across the country to be their 12th employee. I still don't have a resume!","Now, metaphorically, I sit at any table that I want. I can sit with the jocks, I can sit with the gang members, I can sit with the politicians, I can sit with the CEOs. My brand can fit anywhere.","I'm doing activations with companies you would never think of. Not to say this in a braggadocious way, but I'm not putting myself in a box. The only thing that goes in a box is Chinese food and your sneakers - not me.","I get this thing where people are like, 'Man, you got to tell me what to do' - like I have a cheat code to being successful. It's hard work; it's trial and error. I failed, but I never let failure get to my head or to my heart.","I like to take people out of their element.","Giving back has definitely kept me grounded. Stepping outside of yourself to serve a group or community of people who are in need in some facet has a way of doing that. I don't ever want to grow to a place where giving back becomes a foreign concept.","I believe that God has blessed me in immeasurable ways so that I can, in return, bless and help others.","One of my most memorable moments serving the community was after I built the Live Civil Playground in Haiti, and I visited an orphanage and gave away shoes to all the kids. I also sat with them and helped them design their shoes. The smiles on their faces were priceless.","When I was young, I originally wanted to be a radio on-air personality. Once I realized I may not be fit for that - I was infatuated with hip-hop - that I still wanted to be a part and give back the community, so I decided to carve my own path and make my own lane.","Growing up in America, even in the rougher parts of Elizabeth, I had two nice playgrounds to choose from as a child.","I clung to my vegan friends for more support than anyone because they helped guide me and made the transition much easier. My family was a bit skeptical, as they felt like I wasn't getting enough protein in my vegan diet.","I make sure I eat before I go anywhere just in case they don't have a vegan-friendly option.","I love vegan tacos... soooo good! I invite friends over to have some, and they can't believe they aren't eating real meat.","I take yoga classes, do a mile run, and of course take part in some kind of water sport.","Growing up was very interesting for me. If you were Haitian, people just automatically assumed that English was a second language. So they had a special class for my brother and I, but we spoke proper English.","When I first started blogging, it was about getting out new music and capturing artists working in the studio. This was before artists were so social. They weren't so hands-on then.","For blogs today, it's really about content creation and partnering with a brand. You can get the news in so many forms and so many places. A tweet now is enough to tell you about a story. People don't have to click to go to your site.","At first, social media was just about networking. But now that I have to network, I make sure that every platform makes money for me. You can do something on Facebook.","I am the CMO (Chief Marketing Officer) of Marathon Agency, a new venture with my business partner Steve Carless. It's a management, branding, marketing, and business strategy. I'm in charge of marketing and branding clients like Nick Cannon, Nicki Minaj, and more.","At the end of the day, I'm still an African-American woman in a male-dominated industry, so sometimes you have to deal with people not taking your ideas seriously. But I look at it as, I'd rather have adversities in something that I love than doing something that I hate or where I am not interested.","Christmas is always a great time because I get to be around family and spend time with my brother, nieces, and nephews, so that's what I plan to do. It's great to disconnect from everything.","I tell people to use me as example of what they can do if they don't give up. I like people to see me as a 'girl next door' who conquered and went after what she wanted.","It's all about how you use your social platform. Right now, I'm just using mine to empower people, get my entertainment and my news. Other people use their platform for different things.","It's unfortunate that cyberbullying is something that happens to 13-year-old kids in junior high and adults in the workplace. It's something that we have to deal with as Americans.","You work hard, you sacrifice for everything you do, and in one second, someone can tarnish your name - someone can bad-mouth you, and someone can say things. People let all of the good things gets washed away because someone spoke ill of them.","Words do cut, and they do hurt. It was one thing growing up where you were bullied, but you'd just come home. Now you can't really escape it. It's to a point where you turn off that phone, you live your life, and you try not to let the words of others offend or stop you from being you and living your life.","For so long, we were labeled - you're a girly girl, you're a tomboy, you're this or that - but now we can do what we want. One style doesn't define me.","All I cared about was 'TRL.' I was studying communications at school, and one day before class, I heard about the 'Search For An Apprentice' program.","I'd worked in music for years and built all these relationships, so I bought a camera, built a website, and decided to go for it.","I just knew I loved music, and I wanted to do something in music, but I couldn't sing, I can't dance, I am an introvert. So I was like, 'What exactly is there for me to do? What can I do?' There's all these questions, there's all these things that are telling you 'no' instead of 'yes.' Those are the things I dealt a lot with, my insecurity.","This is random, but I thought I was going to have the biggest Backstreet Boys fansite. I'm not even gonna lie: I thought I was gonna marry one of the Backstreet Boys, and I was gonna be his Yoko Ono.","I fell in love with hip-hop a little bit late; I grew up on Another Bad Creation and Kris Kross. But my mom got me a TV in my room, and I remember seeing Biggie's 'Give Me One More Chance,' and I was like, 'Oh, this is how a house party looks!' I really, really fell in love with it when Tupac created 'Dear Mama.'","The assistants, the managers, the PR, the person whose coordinating, the person in production - those are the people I loved communicating with and building network relationships with.","That's the wonderful thing about picking and choosing who we want to work with, because I've been in situations where I've worked with someone, and they thought they were gonna be on the cover of 'XXL' in two months. I'm like, 'That's not how it works.'","When I started my career, I never looked at myself as one to be inspirational, but as I continued to grow, I've met so many different people who ask, 'How do you do it? You make it look easy.' But it's not easy. I have certain tricks and tips I use every day that have been working for me.","Being in this business and surviving day-to-day can be a constant struggle. It's about learning how to be your own super hero, put on your own cape, and be a well-rounded individual.","What are you doing to magnify and grow your business? What are you doing for yourself? You have to self-motivate. I had to learn a million things on Google until I was able to meet people who I could partner with for help.","People go to their jobs and hate it every day, but they have great ideas. Put that same time and effort into something you love - it really starts with being honest with yourself.","People see your life on social media, and they say, 'Oh my gosh, it's perfect,' and I'm like, 'No, every day, it's not even just a struggle: it's something new, and it's a new challenge to make sure that I'm mentally stable and healthy and that I'm okay.' It was just great to finally get it out and talk about it.","For me, for a very long time, I was in denial because when you say you're sad or you're overwhelmed, we consider it whining or complaining. People say, 'Count your blessings,' and it's like, 'Yeah, I am, but I'm still sad. Something is wrong with me.' I had to acknowledge it.","I don't have family in this business. I had two parents that loved me, that worked 24-7, and this is what instilled hard work in me. So you hear the stories about my upbringing, my religion.","You don't know what's going to happen to you in the next hour. So you just live your life, live to the best of your potential, and just be happy.","The blueprint, for me, was having an understanding of self because this business will try to make you somebody other than yourself or make you change with the times. A lot of times, people will want you to do everything for free, work for free, to be down to do this after you paid your dues.","No one is going to break me. No one is going to stop me. No one is going to remove a vision that I see for myself and the love that's in my heart.","A lot of times, you see everyone's highlight reels because of social media. You don't know the work that went into getting to that point. This is something that's going to take time, hard work, and you have to be dedicated towards your craft.","I've made social mistakes. We've all made our mistakes and tried things we kind of wish we didn't, but we plan around it. Things happen in situations that are unique and different, and no one is perfect.","Be You, Live Civil was a tour that I started, and it's just always something that I've been to myself. 'Be you, live civil' is like 'live my life.' That was my short version of saying to live my life.","Nobody is going to love and honor your dreams like yourself. It's really not looking for someone to be your superhero but for us to save ourselves and to really understand that. I've been at the lowest of lowest of my life, and it took that for me to realize that I want to do better and to be better.","I give people on my team the opportunity to excel as well, and I think that's what continues to keep me ahead. I may not be able to show or do an interview; I give them the opportunity to run the show, and that has been working.","I love my religion, I love everything about it, but at the same time, I love my career, and I want to do it with the same love and compassion.","Now, I'm not 100% there, but every day I wake up, I'm happy being me, and I just feel fulfilled.","I admired and wanted to be a lot like Angie Martinez. As I got older, I realized that I had a soft monotone voice and that being a DJ may not be the career for me. However, I was so in love and infatuated with hip-hop that I still wanted to be a part and give back the community, so I decided to carve my own path and make my own lane.","I did the 'right' thing and got a corporate job on Wall Street. That did not last long. I felt like I was throwing all my years of hard work and relationship-building down the toilet. I eventually quit, went and bought a camera, and built a website. That was the birth of KarenCivil.com.","It's a feeling I can't describe, to see my work in action. The best is when an artist is appreciative.","I have my own marketing company, Always Civil, where I help artists create their online identity. I have worked with Lil Wayne, Young Jeezy, Mary J. Blige, Pusha T - the list goes on.","I am big on not pushing anything that I wouldn't do or use. I understand my brand, vision, and the story I want to tell. I am not into taking short-cuts like tummy teas or waist trainers. I want my brand to be a lifestyle and very premium but, at the same time, relatable.","We now live in an era where everybody is rich, and for some reason, everybody has a $20K bag. It is great to have those things, but I want the people who follow me to feel inspired and not jealous. Once you figure out your overall message, then you can push forward.","Do you want to be the girl that's envied, or do you want to be the girl that inspires you? Most people don't know that I am super shy and timid, but online people think I have a big personality. Make sure whatever you do has an overall message and has value.","I am not quick to call someone a friend. It is OK to have acquaintances and be associates. We make these words sound bad, but it is about understanding everyone's place in your life. I have a great group of people around me. I value them more than anything.","As an Elizabeth native, I believe it is my duty to give back to my community. Our youth is our future, and it truly takes a village to raise a child.","I want children to know that they can create the life they dream of despite the odds that are against them.","Nothing is ever quick. You have to grow an audience, keep them engaged, give them a reason to keep coming back so it will never be an overnight success. Have patience!","Everything is a learning lesson, good and bad, so I am happy with the way things are, and I learned from everything negative. I am in a great space now, so I wouldn't change a thing!","I just tell myself I gotta get up at 8 A.M. I don't even use an alarm clock.","Anywhere I go, if I go out, I have to keep my phone out. I don't try to be rude. If I turn it around, I have to check it every 5 minutes.","When I had dial-up, my mom got me a phone so I wouldn't tie up the phone. She used to really pick up the phone, push some buttons, and hang it up so the connection could mess up. Now, it's a joke with her, like, 'Look, the Internet's 24/7. I have WiFi now.'","I took business and economics courses. More than anything, I learned the proper steps and the things that need to be outlined. You have to keep your books: how much money you made, how much money you're spending, what you profited, and what you're gonna need for expenses.","I come from a great home and fully supportive family that helped to nurture my dreams. A lot of people don't have those same things in their household.","Society sets us up to be everything but ourselves, but I want to take a moment and say to people, love yourself. Find your purpose. You are unique, and that makes you great. I pursued my dreams. You can do it, too.","Chances have been taken, opportunities granted, and because of such, I find myself in a position where some of my biggest dreams are in arm's reach.","The world is your stage. Make your mark.","Never stray from life's purpose. Refrain from counting someone else's blessings instead of your own.","I wasn't the biggest hip-hop fan, because I had to listen to whatever my parents listened to, so growing up, it was a lot of Dolly Parton, Elvis, and Whitney Houston. When they finally put a TV in my room and I got to listen to MTV Jams I was like: 'Here I am!'","With Drake, I was a big fan of 'Degrassi.'","People will find any reason not to give you credit for your success because, in their mind, your success is their failure.","I wanted to focus on creating a solid foundation, creating my blueprint, and understanding who I was. You can get distracted easily, and people take you off course with just a compliment. I wanted the focus to be on Karen Civil the businessperson, not what I wore, not what I looked like.","Unfortunately, Haiti does not have many safe environments for children to play and express themselves.","Coming from a Haitian-American home, I thought it was necessary to give back to the country in which my parents were raised. That is why I believe in Project PlayWorld's efforts to to provide secure playing spaces for the children of Haiti with the Live Civil Playground.","I believe in the power of play.","Nicki Minaj is one of those rare artists who get the social aspect of their career. She interacts with her fans. She replies to them. She gets them information first.","Me myself, I wanna wear sweats with my Jordans one day or a dress with my Jeffrey Campbell.","She has a lot of Team Minaj soldiers, and they ride for her. She's genuinely about her fans; she just makes sure that she answers questions, and plays around with them."],"Karen DeCrow":["In my opinion, the battles over birth control and Planned Parenthood are primarily neither political nor religious. This is an issue of equality for women. This is an issue of women's rights: Planned Parenthood is the most important private provider of reproductive health care for women in the United States.","How did abortion and birth control impact the congressional race of Dan Maffei and Ann Marie Buerkle or the presidential race between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney? I don't know. But I think the so-called social issues were front and center in the minds of voters. These issues may indeed have lost the Republicans some elections.","After 'Roe v. Wade' - when the U.S. Supreme Court legalized abortion in 1973 - I thought the national conversation about abortion and birth control would be over. It was not.","First lady has been a thankless position. Eleanor Roosevelt was brilliant and had strong views. She was criticized for her politics and for her appearance. Mrs. Roosevelt was attacked for being too involved in politics. Bess Truman was criticized for being uninvolved in politics.","Opera is the most complete art form. It includes drama, acting, technology (lighting), art (the sets), dance, and the epitome of the human voices. But mostly, go for the glorious music. The arts are crucial to the life of every community.","Opponents of legal birth control, including abortion, have tried for decades to play the race card, saying that legal abortion is racist. What they ignore is that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. accepted the Margaret Sanger Award from Planned Parenthood in 1966.","The irony is that the more we fight age, the more it shows. Paint on a 50-year-old face brings to mind a Gilbert and Sullivan comic figure. Smooth the cheeks, and suddenly the ear lobes and hands look out of place. Do we run around in October, painting the gold leaves green?","No matter what is happening in life or in the world - war, natural disaster, poor health, pain, the death of loved ones - if existence is filled with art, music and literature, life will be fulfilling, a joy.","If a woman makes a unilateral decision to bring pregnancy to term, and the biological father does not, and cannot, share in this decision, he should not be liable for 21 years of support... autonomous women making independent decisions about their lives should not expect men to finance their choice.","As I grow older, I become more and more of a Marxist - Groucho, that is. When you have lived two-thirds of your life, you know the value of a good joke.","Father's Day each year makes me grateful for what my father did for me. This has little to do with our relationship, and much to do with what he taught me.","George McGovern - and I campaigned very hard for his election - was not, in the summer of 1971, a strong feminist ally. But he did come around.","I was running for mayor of Syracuse - the first woman to run for mayor in our city, or in New York, and one of the first in the United States. I was known for my strong conservation plank. In 1969, the term 'conservation' was hardly on the tip of every citizen's tongue.","In chamber music, the audience can hear each instrument and understand (and feel) what the composer and the musicians have in mind as they play.","Just as the Supreme Court has said that women have the right to choose whether or not to be parents, men should also have that right.","In the battle between the sexes, men and women will go practically to the end of the earth in illogical, irrational ways to give each other pain.","We should cease thinking about men as the enemy of children and women.","I joined NOW on an issue of pay.","When I was in school, there was no such thing as girls' athletics.","From 1961 to 1964, I was fortunate enough to work at a think tank in the Kenwood neighborhood of Chicago. As a writer and editor, I reported in a publication about the thinkers. Our offices were in a former mansion; I worked in what had been the ballroom. As I sat typing my copy, I imagined the dancers waltzing.","I enjoy practicing law too much to even contemplate retiring, but I often think about engaging in serious study of the history of art, of the intricacies of classical music. I could write a fugue, or perhaps learn to play the cello.","In the 1950s in the United States, few music lovers were listening to chamber music. Daddy played Bach and Haydn on our phonograph for me. Not only did I become familiar with the form; he discussed the concerti. My own head start. My own Head Start.","Daddy was hilarious. He could take the most mundane event and tell it so that we all on the floor laughing. He trained me in the joys of humor.","Most of us believe that women can do what men do. The challenge is to convince employers, legislators, mothers, that men can do what women do.","Asked to give advice to a 13-year-old girl about how to lead her life, I say find something you love to do. The goal shouldn't be accumulating money. It might be making changes in the world, or in your country.","In 1989, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that minority set-aside programs in municipal contracts were unconstitutional. The court wondered if there were proof that people of color even want to receive municipal contracts.","If supporters of equality for women want to vote for the best candidate, they must look to a person regardless of gender and must disregard the gender of political opponents.","During the 19th-century struggle for women's rights in America, many saw a competition between rights for black people and those for women.","As any opera fan knows, lawyers and judges do not fare well in most operas. Just consider the productions of 'Andrea Chenier,' 'Aida, Norma,' 'Billy Budd,' 'Peter Grimes,' 'The Crucible,' 'Lost in the Stars,' 'The Marriage of Figaro,' 'The Makropulos Case' and Wagner's 'Ring' cycle. Around 1810, the theme of justice emerged in opera.","Operas elucidate, in a way sometimes absent in other theatrical productions, the very human fact that in every hero, there is a thread of duplicity. In every villain, there is another side to consider: We don't have to like him or her, but we are compelled to think about motivation.","Knowing constitutional law helps one at the opera. The trial in 'Billy Budd,' as example, invokes the fugitive slave clause of the U.S. Constitution.","Fifty-nine cents. For years, I wore a button - '59 cents.' Many of my colleagues wore it also. The purpose was so that people would come up and ask, 'What does '59 cents' mean?' One could then launch into a discussion about how women working full time in the U.S. earn 59 cents for every dollar earned by men.","The censors have always had a field day with James Joyce, specifically with 'Ulysses,' but also with his other writings. The conventional wisdom is that this is because of sexually explicit passages (and there certainly are those). I have always thought that what the critics hated and feared about Joyce is his cry for human freedom.","Despite the strength of the feminist movement in the 1970s and beyond, a fable has persisted that educated women are rejected as marriage partners.","Most of the well-known American feminists of the 19th century did not come out against the institution of marriage.","Is it a recent occurrence that women have tried to control when and if they reproduced? Absolutely not. By 2000 B.C., there was worldwide use of herbal potions to prevent pregnancy. Condoms were made from animal bladders.","In my opinion, right up there with free public schools, our free public library system is what makes citizenship possible, even what makes America great.","Most experiences are either sensual or intellectual. Chamber music, played by a small group so the listener can follow what each player is doing, is both.","Composers most identified with the chamber music form are Corelli, Vivaldi, Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert and, of course, Bach. Of course, Bach. If there is any one composer who gives us reason and emotion, it is Bach.","Education, doing homework, is the way to lift up girls. Around the world, where girls are educated, the economy and the standard of living rise.","Betty Ford and I were colleagues for years, working together for women's rights in Washington, D.C., and elsewhere in the country.","Patricia Nixon gave up a career to become a political wife. She rose to the pinnacle of glory and then fell to disgrace because of deeds over which she had neither control nor knowledge.","Being first lady is a full-time job. Betty Ford worked full time and should have received a salary. Michelle Obama works full time and should be paid.","The Metropolitan Opera, of course, is the gold standard in opera. The Met experience includes the huge stage, the vast audience, the elaborate sets. Anyone who saw 'Faust' there - I did - knows exactly what hell is like, complete with fire, smoke and terror.","One year, I was a patron of a new opera. It was, to put it kindly, unpleasant to the ear. The friends I went with hated it. Keeping quiet about my contribution, I was outed when one of them, reading the program at the restaurant during dinner, saw my name.","When 'Carmen' premiered in 1875, it was panned by the critics. It survived 45 performances. It was called a musical and moral outrage. After Bizet died, at age 37, 'Carmen' became wildly popular. If you believe in your creation, and the rest of the world is laughing or yelling 'Boo,' don't give up.","Over the years, the most ponderous problem for women has been that men think that men and women are very different. Another of our massive problems is that women also think that men and women are very different.","Our culture is intent on taking the lines out of people's faces - surgically, with costly creams, and with fear and trembling - when, in fact, the opposite should be the case. As artists know, if there is anything behind a face, that face improves with age.","At 20 and 30, we are like travelers in a foreign country, reading the guide book to learn how to behave, to learn when the post office is open. Trivia looms important; critical issues fade into a pastel background, unrecognized.","It is crucial to be healthy, for pain wipes out the possibility for pleasure, and severe pain removes the possibility of turning to the world outside the body. So we must establish the idea that it is important to look well, not to look young."],"Karen Duffy":["It really is a blessing when two people who are so full of dignity and kindness and really live to make the world a better place get together.","In a way, I have simplified my life by setting priorities.","I am enormously honored to be one of the spokesmen of the New Age Womens Health Campaign, so you'll be seeing me in public service announcements and public appearances supporting the campaign.","I try to manage my time to conserve energy.","I did as much research as I could and I took ownership of this illness, because if you don't take care of your body, where are you going to live?","My father managed shopping malls when I was a kid, and my high school job was to dress up in an elf costume and take photos of kids sitting on Santa Claus's lap.","Concealing an illness is like keeping a beach ball under water.","A lot of people asked me if it was frustrating not having a clear specific diagnosis, but I didn't mind, I just chose the most optimistic diagnosis.","In addition, I'll be attending women's health expos and medical conferences with the goal to promote dialogue between women and their health-care providers.","Everyone who has sarcoidosis is affected differently.","My friend had a funny remark; he told me everybody has something - some people have a big butt, some people are insecure and at least you know what it is, even if it's a lump on your head. I know I have a lump on my head.","My family has been amazing, and they understand how blessed I am. They've been able to keep my sense of humor.","I just had that conversation this morning with my doctor. I just got back from the hospital a half-hour ago, and nothing will make me happier than to replicate the DNA of my amazing husband. I'm optimistic.","In the beginning, when I first found out I had a disease that was incurable, emotionally I had to get used to the idea of being sick before I could think about making any other major decisions in my life.","The lesion is in the area of my brain that is responsible for motor function, so I have continual chronic pain in my left arm from elbow to fingertips and the right side of my body from my ear to my breast area.","I don't have feeling in my feet to my fingertips; I also have active lesions in my bone marrow and in my eyes.","I still when I wake up hit the ground running; and having an illness, I'm only one of hundreds of thousands of people that live with an illness, and I'm just in awe of the bravery and dignity of the people I see at the hospital.","I never expected in a million years that I would have the honor to become an advocate of women's health care and education, and I'd dive on a live grenade to get this message out, so thank you for this forum.","I am a bit of a Cheap Pete, but I do spend a fortune on books and false moustaches and practical jokes.","My Mt. Rushmore of hero worship would include Ralph Waldo Emerson, Marcus Aurelius, Frank Sinatra and Barry White.","It is a mistake to do nothing just because you think you can only do a little.","The ancient Greek view of happiness was really defined by leading a productive life: It's not about how much you have, it's about what you do with it.","You become a parent when you have a baby, no matter how you get there.","I have lots and lots of party clothes. I mean real party clothes.","I prefer atrophy over exercise any day."],"Karen Elson":["Trends come and go, and style evolves. It's important to have pieces of jewelry that are timeless and look chic despite ever-changing fashions.","As scary as it is, I like making real, direct eye contact with people from the stage. In a sense, it's like modeling: that feeling of locking in and projecting some kind of emotion to try to captivate people.","It's time to give back; you know, I've lived in this beautiful world of fashion for so long, and it's time to really get my hands dirty and get in the trenches and see the world for what it really is.","I feel Dress for Success is basically about empowering women who were in a disadvantaged situation. The act of wearing a suit when she's walking in the door, it's so powerful - it's about gaining control of their lives and situations.","I am obsessed with the Great Depression and with former showgirls - and the Victorians - the idea of wistful, dark romance.","The interesting thing with fashion is that it's really a massive daydream.","I would go home and be this insular girl who listened to music and brooded in her bedroom.","As a model, I am at the mercy of everybody else. It's much more of a situation where I go to work, put the clothes on, get in front of the camera, and then go home. But in that process, I never really have control over any of it.","Ultimately, I've learned to pride myself on being quirky. I very much adore people who are outcasts, and I've always loved to be around interesting, circus-type people.","I constantly have a devil on my shoulder telling me that what I'm doing is really horrible, and then somehow the lightning strike happens, and everything comes together.","I've been in a New York City-based cabaret for the past seven years called The Citizens Band. It's possibly one of the most brilliant things I've ever been involved with.","I had a diary full of lyrics and whatnot and a little voice recorder of guitar riffs.","I like those stories that capture the brutality of life, but there's still some kind of melancholy romance.","I knew I had more in me than just standing up and having my picture taken... Being in the studio, I have to have an opinion.","It's just this huge sense of relief I have with myself right now... It took me to be 31 to go, 'Wow, I'm really happy being a model.'","I tend to sort of over-accessorize, but to feel empowered, I strip it all down and become minimal so that it's almost counterintuitive.","I love Jen Meyer - she's a dear friend, and Tabitha Simmons as well.","Research on the Internet, research what people say about the vintage stores, look online to see if customer service is good because that's really important. Also to see online what other customers say.","I've been writing songs since I was at least 20. That's what I wanted to do before I became a model.","There was this moment, particularly after I had my first child, where I felt like, 'I don't know if I'll ever make a record, or if this is always going to be something just floating around in my head.'","I am a woman. I go on set, and I'll be who I am, and I'll represent who I am. I think it comes with age.","Being a model, you're always the product of somebody else's vision.","I was always the weirdo at school.","I just love vintage. I have far too many vintage dresses.","I feel like somehow I'm living my life mentally in reverse. It's taken me to my 30s to feel relaxed and comfortable in my skin. I think I'm going to be dancing on tables when I'm 50. I really hope I am.","At some hotels, I feel like I have to be dressed to the nines - perfectly eccentric - to walk out the door.","You don't just wake up one morning and decide to become a singer-songwriter.","I'm a fan of creating the mood and vibe with flowers, candles, and music. I love making my guests feel like it's not formal and they can relax in my home.","Think about your menu, and if you're not a skilled chef - which I'm not - follow a recipe. You can't go wrong if you don't cut the fine print.","If I wasn't a model, I would never have been around interesting musicians, even had the financial capabilities to say, 'I don't have to work right now. I can sit and make my record.'","I was always singing as a kid. That's honestly all I've ever wanted to do.","I think Jennifer Lawrence is a brilliant role model for young girls, not some of the models that I see on the runway.","I don't want my children to ever think that food is taboo.","Even though I have lived in the States since I was 18, in my head I am still very British, and I do have this romance for towns in Middle America that nobody gets to see.","If a model is going to make some shoes, she's going to make them comfortable."],"Karen Fairchild":["I have an obsession with fashion - it's another form of expression for me - and I have a growing collection of vintage clothes and jewelry. Being able to play dress-up for my career has been a gift.","There's nothing better than a glass of wine, a girlfriend, and a long talk.","My favorite big city would have to be Chicago. I lived in Indiana for several years and would always go into the city with my family for Cubs games or to visit the aquarium and museums on field trips.","I like for my home to reflect my fashion. I love adding earthy pieces to something very glamorous, and I love having things with a history or a story sitting alongside an uber-modern piece.","Music can be such a vulnerable thing, so when you're delivering a vocal or writing a piece of music, it's easy to get sideways.","The greatest thing about being in a band, and the strength of having companionship and collaboration, is also the thing that makes a band break up because then you begin to feel confined. Like, who am I as an individual, as a writer, as a performer?","I'm pretty obsessed with 'The Real Housewives of New Jersey.' I usually watch it on the bus after a show with my husband Jimi. As much as he will deny it, he loves the show as much as I do."],"Karen Finerman":["I have been able to have a family and to dedicate quality time to my two sets of twins and my husband, as well as to serve on the boards of The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research and Montefiore Medical Center.","It's OK to have a plan, to invest in your future - for your financial security, your love life, your personal fulfillment, and even your happiness. To have personal happiness as a stated goal doesn't detract from it if you get there.","I applied to only one college - the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania - and was fortunate to be accepted. After graduation, I headed to Wall Street and worked as I had dreamed.","Never have anyone else carry your luggage. Pack only what you need.","Don't waste even a minute magnifying your perceived inadequacies. You can't do it all. Why berate yourself for not achieving the impossible?","Serendipity is nice, but hoping for luck and the magic of happenstance shouldn't be an excuse for a lack of proactivity. I had to learn for myself that waiting isn't a life plan.","When I was 15 years old, I read an article about Ivan Boesky, the well-known takeover trader - turned out years later it was all on inside information! But before that came to light, he was very successful, very flamboyant. And I thought, 'This is what I want to do.' So I'm 15 years old, I decide I'm going to Wall Street.","Companies are always being bought and sold. The markets are always moving; you have to be on top of your position. And in the U.S., the market is never closed for more than three days. The only time the market was ever closed was 9/11. I think it may have been closed the whole week.","I never want to have to ask my husband for money. Never! That's incomprehensible to me. Would he have preferred that I change my name? Probably. But that's OK!","I've seen women afraid to stretch for things. They avoid opportunities they don't feel qualified for yet. Instead, they should grab risky opportunities that will force them to grow on the job and learn to do it.","Women should learn from men to compartmentalize. It's a great skill that some women have naturally but others have to practice. The goal is to keep one area of your life that might not be going well from causing unnecessary disruptions in another area.","Maintaining boundaries is hard. That's why I strongly prefer the physical separation of work and home.","Every day, turn off your phone/email for some part of the day.","I was raised a Calvinist. You might think you know what that means, but let me explain it the way my mother preached it to my three sisters and me back when we were at home: 'I buy my girls Calvin Klein clothes, so that's all they know. Then, when they graduate from college, they have to figure out how to pay for them themselves.'","As a teenager, rather than setting myself on a course to pursue fame (quite common growing up in L.A., the entertainment capital of the world), happiness, fulfillment, and spiritual enlightenment (also quite common), I skipped right on to trying to be successful. 'Let's just get on with it,' I felt. 'Onward' became my motto.","I wanted to get out in the world, have a great job, make my mark, and see how far I could go. And I wanted to make good on the philosophy my mother drilled into us with all the subtlety of a Lady Gaga performance. I got it loud and clear. I would need to succeed, and then I could possibly be happy.","As a working mother, the last thing you need is to be hard on yourself. As a stay-at-home mother, the last thing you need is to be hard on yourself. As a twenty something with no job prospects or life partner in sight, the last thing you need is to be hard on yourself.","Protect yourself like you would your cubs - as a grown woman, you're no one's cub anymore.","When you multitask, you believe you're being exceptionally productive, but really, you're fooling yourself. Each time you switch tasks, you have to backtrack a little and remind yourself where you are in the process and what's next. Invariably. you are spending twice as much time on parts of the task.","I remember the absolute, joyous freedom I felt when I first went to college: I had no bedtime, no curfew, no rules - I loved it. I was in charge. I couldn't believe I didn't have to answer to anyone.","I have spent much of my life where the boys are, first as a tomboy and then on Wall Street. Growing up, I loved every and any sport. I was frustrated by girls who didn't, so I spent most of my afternoons with the boys.","Working from home as a mother is the worst of everything. You don't have clear boundaries. The kids can get used to you going to work; they can't get used to you ignoring them. And work sometimes gets the message you're not as committed.","You cannot be in charge of a family and run a big company.","Make as much money as you can. It really does help. I don't know why it's terrible to say, but it's true.","I have always wondered why more women did not look into owning their own funds. Granted, it is a high stress, high risk business, but it also offers high rewards and control.","I enjoy being on CNBC's 'Fast Money,' in part so that audiences can watch a woman who is as well informed about, and invested in, the market as her male counterparts."],"Karen Fukuhara":["I've always wanted to play a samurai warrior.","One of my first interviews was Keira Knightley, Orlando Bloom, and Johnny Depp for 'Pirates of the Caribbean.' I was in eighth grade at the time, little teenybopper. I was so, so nervous. I just remember Johnny had an aura around him.","The main issue when it comes to hiring someone from Asia is the language barrier. It's difficult to book someone when they don't speak the language and they can't deliver the lines or even speak to the director. But in terms of Asian-American actresses, we all speak it fluently!","I don't come from a well-off family. We're very middle-class, lower-middle-class, so that's something I cherish.","I grew up in a unique environment where I was immersed in both Japanese and American cultures equally.","Upon graduation, I hit a wall. All of my good friends from UCLA were taking on jobs they were passionate about, and I felt left behind. It took a bit of soul searching, but in the end, I finally had the guts to pursue acting.","I'd like to see more Asian-American roles where the ethnicity of the character can be swapped to another. We can, of course, play the stereotypical ninja, the martial arts master, the accountant, the doctor, but we can be more than that!","I adore actors/actresses that have range: someone that can transform into a character that is far beyond who they truly are. Charlize Theron and Johnny Depp are amazing at this.","I've always wanted to become an actress. It's been a lifelong dream, but my family and I didn't know how to do it.","Here's what I love about social media: You get to peer into people's lives that you normally wouldn't be able to.","My parents are pretty open-minded.","My mom suggested studying acting in college, but I was a bit scared to choose that path because I couldn't wrap my head around the drama school audition process.","I started karate in middle school when my parents wanted me to babysit my younger brother. He was a little troublemaker, so they wanted me to make sure the class was going okay. I ended up being way more into it than my brother.","I love food, and I love carbs: Pasta, rice - that's my thing.","I actually am very hands-off on my face. I like to use oil to take everything off, and then I cleanse after.","I try to go to the gym. I either go on the rower or watch a TV show on the treadmill, and then I do some weight lifting.","After graduating college, I finally allowed myself to strive for what I loved to do, even if there were no guarantees that I would be able to make a living off of acting. This, combined with my life experiences prior - like stars aligning - led me to this lovely role of Katana within the DC Comics universe.","I believe film and television should reflect our society, and the reality is that there are people in many different shapes and sizes, ethnicities, sexual orientation - the list goes on."],"Karen Gillan":["Acting is all about finding the truth within whatever world you're in.","It's good to go with your gut instincts in life. You just should. Even if it doesn't work out, something good will come out of it.","I don't like modeling, but in terms of the places I got to visit, it was great.","I would like to think I'm a good secret-keeper, when it comes to friends. I'm quite loyal like that.","I was one of those weird children that just couldn't talk to people, so I kind of had to make myself be not like that because I knew it was going to hinder me.","I like being involved in interesting and creative things. I'd just rather be involved in creating it, rather than being in it.","How do you create chemistry? If only I knew that! Some people say it's a natural thing that you have with someone, and maybe it is to do with that, but I think you can work on it.","I went to Floridita on Wardour Street when I was 18. All I could afford was pumpkin soup and a glass of champagne, but it was worth it.","I dyed my hair pink when I was fifteen.","I have no sense of being famous - you're just working. And then you'll have a random day in London when you'll do some press and it creeps into your awareness that this goes out - that what you do every day goes out to televisions right across the country.","I wanted to be as authentic as possible because, first of all, Jean Shrimpton is still alive. And, she's interesting enough to be played accurately. I didn't need to add things.","I had a lot of alone time with no brothers or sisters running around, or anything. I would just sit and imagine things, all the time.","I suppose I am one of life's naturally clumsy people; I don't drop stuff all the time, or break things, but I'm just generally a bit flustered.","I never cared about modeling. As a model, you're powerless.","Space excites me. My dream is to go to space.","I've got a coin with my face on it. It is really bizarre.","The last thing you want to do when you are about to film a scene is think, 'Oh my God, so many people are going to watch this.'","I want to be like Robin Williams, really. It's all the different characters he does, all the different voices.","Being in 'Doctor Who' has been so amazing. I don't think I will ever have a job quite so fun ever again. I feel sad because I am going to leave, but with any story, it has to come to an end.","I know what it's like to be a model and go to castings where some people like what they see and others look at you with distaste.","My own fashion sense has been influenced by 'We'll Take Manhattan.' It's gotten a little better.","I just feel so flattered, because the cosplayers really make sure every detail is there. I don't think I've ever cosplayed a character before, but if I were to, I'd probably go as a Klingon from 'Star Trek.'","I really love Alexa Chung's style. I really think she gets it right all the time. I've never seen a picture of her where I didn't love the outfit.","Basically, I always go to vintage shops rather than going shopping for new clothes.","I don't actually do any exercise, which is really bad. But I wear heels a lot. My theory is that it's painful, so it's gotta do something.","I'd like to make over Marilyn Manson and just dress him really normally to see what he looks like. That'd be really weird!"],"Karen Handel":["Increasing minimum wage doesn't build a stronger economy.","I think, for every phase of your life, you take something out of it, you learn from it, you grow from it. You just have to try to take what you can from it and then move on to the next phase of your life to be better.","What I support is moving Medicaid to block grants so that the states can drive that process.","It's tabloid. It's 24/7 news - people get in the middle of a news cycle for 24 hours off of things that previously would never have gotten the kind of coverage that is happening.","I think it's clear that Planned Parenthood has worked to mislead the public about who they are... they do not provide mammograms. They are the middleman, or middle woman, if you will.","I want women to have more access to quality care, and the access to healthcare for women is not through Planned Parenthood; it is through community health centers across the state.","Creating more and better jobs is how you build a strong economy.","We need to lift up the nation so we can find a more civil way to deal with our disagreements because, in these United States of America, no one should ever feel their life threatened over their political beliefs and positions.","I don't think it is just in the world of politics. The lack of civility in society as a whole, some of it, I believe, is very much fueled by social media and frankly, it's fueled by the fact that journalism is not journalism any more.","I do not support a livable wage.","Bullies always have another target.","It's clear that Planned Parenthood went out of its way to paint me as some sort of a zealot - a Trojan-horse zealot who came into Komen and within 10 to 11 months had completely turned the place upside down. That's clearly not who I am, and it's not what happened.","Others do not define you - you define yourself through your words and actions.","I'm proud of the fact that I was able to overcome long odds.","I'm a girl: that means I fight like a girl. And there ain't nothing meaner.","Clearly, there have been changes in the climate.","These immigrants have come to our country and blatantly disregarded our laws. We cannot, we should not, reward that. No amnesty. No ability to vote. Get those borders secure, and then deal with that situation.","People want to know that I'm a person of conviction.","Sometimes you should just put down the computer, the phone, and walk away.","It's been clear for some time that FBI Director Comey has lost the confidence of Republicans, Democrats, and broader institutions, and his removal as FBI Director was probably overdue.","Let me be clear: since I am pro-life, I do not support the mission of Planned Parenthood.","I will ensure the conservative legacy and leadership of Tom Price, Johnny Isakson, and Newt Gingrich will continue.","I think that for a child to be in a household... with a situation where the parents are not married, as in being one man and one woman, is not the best household for a child.","I don't want to see any taxpayer funding going towards... a couple that is not married.","I have a really hard time abiding by falsehoods being left in place.","Any real Colts fan cannot abide the Denver Broncos and John Elway!","In life, sometimes you just lose.","I try not to look back on my life and be regretful.","I've made it abundantly clear that I think that marriage is between a man and a woman.","As a Christian, I view relationships and marriage as being between a man and a woman.","No secret that for some years - long before my time - Komen was dealing with a controversy regarding Planned Parenthood grants.","I'm not going to be lectured by Nathan Deal, who is a former Clinton Democrat. I will stack up my conservative credentials against his any day of the week.","I have much greater faith in the governor and the state legislature to craft a Medicaid system that is going to be the best fit for the people of Georgia rather than someone in Washington dictating it.","I've had to be tough my whole life.","I moved out when I was 17 to get away from a pretty tough and difficult family environment.","A small part of my job at Komen included advocating that mammogram screenings be covered under plans available on the exchanges - just as they are covered in other plans in Georgia.","I think we can all agree that women deserve access to life saving, early detection procedures.","Obamacare was passed months before my first day at Komen.","My time at Komen has been well publicized and scrutinized, especially my departure over the funding of Planned Parenthood.","The status quo - Obamacare - is not acceptable.","It's no secret that I'm called to a different place, maybe, for some of the beliefs in the LGBTQ community because of my faith. With that said, I'm also called to be accepting and compassionate.","My pledge is to be part of the solution to focus on governing, to put my experience to work to help solve the very serious issues we're facing in this country.","I worked my way up in the private sector and implemented Georgia's tough voter ID law.","Hard work and making the most of life - that's what makes Georgians great.","Last time I checked, private nonprofit organizations have a right and a responsibility to be able to set the highest standards and criteria on their own without interference, let alone the level of vicious attacks and coercion that has occurred by Planned Parenthood.","For Komen, for myself, the mission was always foremost in everyone's mind. The mission and the women that we serve. The only group that made this issue political has been Planned Parenthood.","My responsibility is to follow the law.","Planned Parenthood is not the front door of women's health. Not here in the 6th District, not in the state of Georgia, and not around the country.","Some people call me scrappy - and that's because I am.","I left home when I was just 17, finished up high school, and went to work.","I know exactly what it is like to fight against the odds and to overcome adversity."],"Karen Hesse":["I have earned wages as a waitress, a nanny, a librarian, a personnel officer, an agricultural laborer, an advertising secretary, a typesetter, a proofreader, a mental-health-care provider, a substitute teacher, and a book reviewer. In and around the edges of all those jobs I have written poems, stories, and books, books, books.","Young readers are the most challenging, demanding, and rewarding of audiences. Adults often ask why I write for the younger set. My reply: 'I can't think of anyone I'd rather write for.'","While growing up in Baltimore, Maryland, I dreamed of becoming many things: an archaeologist, an ambassador, an actor, an author.","From the time I was ten, I thought of myself as 'good with words,' thanks to a perceptive and supportive fifth grade teacher."],"Karen Horney":["Thou shalt free thyself from convention, from everyday morality.","When one begins, as I did, to analyze men after a fairly long experience of analyzing women, one receives a most surprising impression of the intensity of this envy of pregnancy, childbirth, and motherhood, as well as of breasts and of the act of suckling.","Fortunately analysis is not the only way to resolve inner conflicts. Life itself still remains a very effective therapist.","Until I feel strong enough to pray sincerely and to act accordingly, I would rather not pray at all.","Concern should drive us into action, not into a depression.","The searching for our selves is the most agonizing, isn't it? - and yet the most stimulating - and one simply cannot escape it.","The perfect normal person is rare in our civilization.","Like all sciences and all valuations, the psychology of women has hitherto been considered only from the point of view of men.","The psychology of women hitherto actually represents a deposit of the desires and disappointments of men.","Why is it so unutterably beneficial, the thought that someone besides myself knows me?","Life itself still remains a very effective therapist."],"Karen Hughes":["The travel and tourism industry, it's just a huge part of our economy.","For the year after I left government service, I worked as a consultant to the Republican National Committee because the lawyers advised that was the proper way for me to comply with ethics regulations and continue to advise the President.","Unfortunately, you know, working in a spirit of cooperation and respect requires someone else to reach back, and I don't think that's happened and it's been disappointing because the debate in our country has become so rancorous.","And when I started college, I think I was good at two things: arguing and asking questions.","The President has a wonderful sense of humor, which is one of the reasons it is so much fun to work for him.","I'm also working with Mrs. Bush on some education projects in Afghanistan, so I get to see her a great deal.","I can't imagine anyone who doesn't think the world is safer without a tyrant who murdered his own people, used weapons of mass destruction against them and flouted the world for so many years.","Now, I am completely independent - I earn my living by speaking and writing.","Well, it really describes what it feels like to be a normal person whose boss and friend suddenly runs for the president, and then becomes the president.","I never dreamed I would one day work at it White House.","In fact, my mom always told me because I was the daughter of an Army officer born overseas in Paris, France, that under the Constitution she believed that I could never run for president.","As a young girl I think I wanted to be a horse woman. I loved horses.","I can assure you we are all strong-willed, forceful personalities and the president encourages vigorous debate.","And, you know, I watched him in Texas where he stood on his principle but he also reached out to members of the other party to try to work with them, to try to forge agreement where he could in keeping with his conservative principles to make Texas a better place.","We have to worry about protecting the Constitution.","The facts are on our side."],"Karen Joy Fowler":["I learned how to comport myself among trolls, elves, hobbits or goblins. I learned that a friend can be lost to greed and avarice. I learned that solving riddles may be as important a survival skill as bowmanship. I know how to talk to a dragon, and that it's best not to.","I do read all my work aloud as I'm working - this has made it a little hard to adjust to my husband's retirement. I can shout the shouty parts if I'm alone in the house, but of course, I feel a fool if someone is there to hear me.","I assume that we are all limited by our own brains and experiences and can only understand other people and other creatures through a kind of translation that brings them closer to us.","The process of writing a book is so removed in my mind from the process of publishing it that I often forget for great stretches that I eventually hope to do the latter.","I read my books to writing workshops and friends, and I'm often focussed just on keeping them entertained. I never think about marketing at all.","I can't say that winning the Pen/Faulkner was a dream come true because I would never have dared to dream it.","I hear so many writers say - and these are writers that I trust completely - 'I just started hearing a voice', or, 'The characters came to life'. I am filled with loathing for my own characters when I hear that because they do nothing of the sort. Left to their own devices, they do nothing but drink coffee and complain about their lives.","The smart way to build a literary career is you create an identifiable product, then reliably produce that product so people know what they are going to get. That's the smart way to build a career, but not the fun way. Maybe you can think about being less successful and happier. That's an option, too.","My books have occasionally been of mixed success. It's not like I have gone from triumph to triumph. I have had a couple of books do very, very well and a couple do very, very badly.","Octavia Butler often described herself as an outsider, but within science fiction, she was loved as an insider, someone who was a fan first and came to S.F. writing as an enthusiastic reader.","Octavia Butler was more interested in writing a good story than in worrying about where to slot it.","Butler's novel 'Kindred' may be the book most widely read by readers outside science fiction; it has been assigned as a text in classrooms and has sold steadily since its publication in 1979.","Technically a memoir, 'The Woman Warrior' becomes almost magical through its inclusion of folk tales, dreams, and revisions.","All best-of lists should close with the amazing Kelly Link.","If we see a sad rain, it doesn't mean the rain is sad, but it means we see it. That's an easily dismissible kind of projection. But what I'm struggling to say, is that we take that rain in through our own hearts and emotions and senses and skin, and all those filters have an impact.","In certain ways, we, many of us, stopped paying attention to the world. I have to think we would have moved on the whole climate issue in a different way if we'd been paying better attention.","Often, when you look at history, at least through the lens that many of us have looked at history - high school and college courses - a lot of the color gets bled out of it. You're left with a time period that does not look as strange and irrational as the time you're actually living through.","I had a very loyal cult-like following, I feel. And I don't mean to complain about that.","I was pretty happy with how my career had gone, mainly because of the enormous freedom I've had to write what I've wanted to write. I had a very clear picture of who I was as a writer.","I have always been a generous and enthusiastic reader.","If I'm made to pick one transcendent reading experience, then it was listening to Miss Sarzin as - if we'd been very, very good - she read the next chapter of 'The Hobbit' aloud to us.","Miss Sarzin was the best teacher I ever had."],"Karen Kain":["Treasure the things about you that make you different and unique.","Surround yourself with people who provide you with support and love and remember to give back as much as you can in return.","The arts are an integral part of the city's economic progress.","Friday night is our date night. We really carve out time for each other.","Dancers, like all performing artists, like nothing better than to be challenged.","It's a different era. Our job now is to show leadership and vision and to help the next generation of artists.","When I grow up I am going to be a ballerina. I will be in Giselle. It will be so much fun being a ballerina.","There's nothing like the force and challenge of a new ballet to galvanize everyone involved in bringing it to life.","I really felt it was time for a new vision.","I know how demanding the process of creation is.","You're terrified that nothing will ever give you the fulfillment that dancing has given you.","Know that there is so much more to you than your body. It's not just about perfecting the steps; you must trust your instincts to tell deep, emotional stories through the steps that you are performing.","The importance of the arts to the societies in which they thrive is well documented.","Like everyone else, I want to go on dancing forever, but I know the day is going to come when I will have to be doing something else.","Canadians are very proud of me, of my career.","Even if I had nothing to do with the Canada Council, I'd be praying for it.","I know there are going to be big challenges financially, but I'm excited artistically. I think that if the experience is better artistically, then we have more hope in the future.","I want to leave this company in the best possible shape.","To be able to make decisions and see them come to fruition and feel the excitement around them, what it generates within the company, how the artists get motivated - that's the most rewarding part; feeling I can be a catalyst for an artistic experience for our artists and for the public.","It's a time to reflect and appreciate all the contributions that others have made to my career and my life. My vision is nothing that hasn't been gleaned or understood from watching and working with so many people I admire before me.","In my life, there have always been people who guided my path, towards the school, towards this company. I didn't know about any of it. I didn't have a plan. It's good fortune and generosity from other people that have given me all I have today.","What's a dancer's worst enemy? Sometimes it's age, but sometimes it's the dancer themselves.","In the world of classical ballet there are only a handful of story ballets, so getting a new one is cause for excitement.","We have a renewed energy and vigor in our supporters and we are no longer so frightened about the future.","Talent will only take you so far, and it is your ability to feel the music and explore a movement that will bring you the greatest pleasure in dance."],"Karen Katz":["Every day, I pinch myself. It has been an incredible journey.","When my son was little, we mothers always did the Halloween parties, and I would wear my orange-and-black Chanel. It comes in handy on October 31. I'm the chicest pumpkin around.","For what we want to accomplish in the future, we have to be able to view everything from the eyes of the customer.","While looking ahead, we know challenges remain, but we are encouraged by the strategies we have in place to improve our operational efficiencies and performance.","Sneakers have become a significant category for us and a very tangible reminder that what our customers want and wear is changing.","What's changed in New York, and what made us really change our thinking about New York, is that the different neighborhoods are becoming more important as shopping destinations than they used to be.","I have admired Kevin Plank and Under Armour from afar. He has assembled an impressive team.","People ask me, 'What keeps you up at night?' It's delivering a personal experience to every Neiman Marcus customer.

And the pendulum swings between more, or less, edgy when I'm with bankers.","I certainly don't dumb down the way I dress.","I am the ultimate Jewish mother.","I never had lofty dreams of doing important things.","We built a business on relationships, and that's what matters to us.","We believe that we can deliver better shareholder value by remaining an independent retailer.","We are committed to investing in new technology so we can remain a leader in the online luxury business.","The promotional environment is part of the world we live in.","We want you always to feel confident shopping at Neiman Marcus, and your trust in us is our absolute priority.","We deeply regret and are very sorry that some of our customers' payment cards were used fraudulently after making purchases at our stores.","Today, fashion shows are now blogged and broadcast all over the world via social media. By the time the merchandise ships many months later, the newness and excitement has worn off, and in many cases, the customer has moved on.","Our customers' business interests are heavily dependent on the oil and gas industry.","Partnering with Rent the Runway's innovative model, combined with their affinity amongst millennials, provides an exciting opportunity for us. Together, we're helping the next generation of luxury consumers discover and fall in love with designer fashion.","Back when I was 15 or 16, in Dallas there was a department store called Sanger-Harris. One holiday season, I got a job as a gift wrapper there. The others were all experts who did that job every year, and I was by far the youngest person, who was totally inexperienced. In those days, department stores around Christmastime were a total frenzy.","Over the years, the way our customers shop our stores and websites has changed and will continue to change with the increasing popularity and convenience of smart phones and tablets.","Our customers do not differentiate between channels, and now, neither will we.","We recognized that for our future, and for the way the customer was now shopping, we had to have one point of view. All roads lead back to the customer.","We are now focused on the brand, not the channel.","Bergdorf Goodman is positioned at the very top of the luxury pyramid, and I think that as we go through this next phase of renovation, we're going to elevate it even further.","The demographics and the psychographics show that there should be, over the longer term, a continued growth in the numbers of customers who will be shopping for luxury goods, both domestically - as well, international tourists come to the United States.","There is no question that international tourism is on the rise - we see it at Bergdorf Goodman; we see it in Miami.","Two of our biggest stores are in Dallas NorthPark and Houston Galleria, where the economy and our customers' business interests are heavily dependent on the oil and gas industry.","I am honored to join the Under Armour Board, and look forward to seeing how a founder and CEO operates a dynamic and fast-growing company known for innovation and its competitive edge.","Competing at full price is the way we like to do business, but we cannot ignore the promotional environment.","Customers are extremely savvy. They don't want to pay more.","Chanel is a very important vendor for Neiman Marcus. My favorite thing is the way they finish off the hems on dresses and jackets.","I've never looked at my career as something that I was striving to get to one position or another. For me, it was one step at a time.","My husband, he's very supportive. I couldn't be here without his support along the way.","We have a very robust online business, but convincing luxury houses to join us on the website has involved a lot of groveling.","Diane von Furstenberg is an extraordinary woman. She's modern. She's a mother, a grandmother, a leader."],"Karen Kingsbury":["You don't have love without sacrifice; you can't have sacrifice without love.","Reader loyalty will stay because I'm not changing.","I came to Christ in my early 20s.","I'm receiving 300 to 500 letters every week from people telling me that God used my stories to save their marriage or to introduce them to Christ or to heal a relationship that had been broken.","You need to get down among the people who are the dirtiest and dustiest, and the depravity, and you need to see Christ's light shining there.","My characters are not plastic.","You're gifted to do something.","I can spend 10 to 15 minutes with someone, and they can tell me what they're going through. I may never have gone through that, but I get it on a really deep level.","You need to have time to really hear God.","As I watched bookstores close, I began to wonder how that felt for the owners. Owning a bookstore was their dream and now they're struggling and seeing those dreams fall apart.","The general market wants what I do.","There were times when I was so sick of talking about the Bible.","I always knew I wanted to be a writer.","I developed a deep sadness for celebrities, a pity that they often are caught in a plastic world that runs too hard and too fast, and that many times that world means destroyed relationships with everyone they know and love.","I write about true-life type things.","I write about the trials and triumphs of contemporary life - and often the readers see themselves between the lines of the story.","Secular writers can tell a story about the physical, the emotional, and the intellectual parts of a character. But no matter how well they tell the story, they miss a facet that is innately part of all of us - the spiritual."],"Karen Maitland":["In 1255, Louis IX of France presented an elephant to Henry III of England to add to the menagerie of exotic animals he kept in the Tower of London.","In the Middle Ages, I think the French kings murdered slightly fewer of their family members than the English kings, though I haven't actually counted the heads.","I'd love to own Newstead, partly because it belonged to Lord Byron, but also to try to uncover what dark secrets really lie beneath.","The English king's power was curbed by Parliament, though that wasn't always a good thing, as politicians often behave no better than monarchs - there are just more of them.","We forget how bawdy and brutal the Middle Ages were.","People sense that our reaction to phenomena such as epidemics or religious war is not that different to how we reacted to plagues or to battles a millennia ago.","People are willing to do the most appalling things to another person for the sake of imposing a religious belief."],"Karen McCarthy":["I made sacrifices willingly; it was what I did best.","I'm pleased the committee recommended no action, as I know I did nothing wrong.","Too often, I've put my career and helping others ahead of my own needs."],"Karen McDougal":["My dream date is a tall, dark, handsome, blue eyed man with a bubble butt who will whisk me away to Paris in a hot air balloon to wine me, dine me and.","If you want to meet a woman, it's best just to smile and say hi.","I love to wear lingerie. The problem is that men always rip it off too quickly. When women are dolled up in lingerie they feel sexy. So let us wear it for five minutes.","I've actually been turned down for jobs because I was in Playboy.","The only foreplay I really need is for a guy to kiss my hip bone. The hip is the most erotic and neglected body part. Kiss the hip bone with your lips.","For me the ideal date would be to drink wine in the backyard under the stars, listen to music and just talk. Then we'd eat steak and, later, dessert. If all went as planned, we'd save some of the dessert and play with it while making out.","A lot of Playmates look like Playmates, but I look so girl-next-door and wholesome.","We all want to be the sexy girl.","Like most women, I hate when a guy tries to pick me up by saying, You are the hottest girl I've ever seen. It's totally unrealistic. There are beautiful women everywhere."],"Karen Mills":["Small businesses, you can give them capital, but what they often need as much is mentoring, advice and help with their business plan.","It's not government that creates jobs; it's small business. Our job is to make sure they have the access to capital, the access to contracting opportunities, and the help, advice and mentoring that they need to go out and be successful.","We have to keep the momentum going in the economy. And we have to make sure that we give small businesses as much cash and liquidity as possible so they have the confidence to hire that next worker.","After four years as Administrator of the SBA, I have let President Obama know that I will not be staying for a second term. I will stay on until my successor is confirmed to ensure a smooth and seamless transition.","This is not a zero-sum game. We know that if we provide access and education, particularly where there are gaps in the market, we will create more jobs, we will create more growth, and we will create more activity in the U.S. market, which will be good for our economy.","In October 2008, when the credit crunch hit, small businesses were really crushed by the lack of capital.","We are very much engaged across the government, very much engaged in streamlining and simplifying our activities with borrowers and lenders, because that saves time and saves costs and we believe we can do that while maintaining the same or increased levels of oversight and risk management.","As I've traveled around the country, it has surprised me how many times I've heard people in small businesses use that word 'saved.' I believe many small businesses would not have had access to credit and would not have survived without the $50 billion that we were able to put into the market.","We really accomplished what we set out to do with the Recovery Act programs, which was to fill the lending gap created by the crisis.","We spend a great deal of our energy making sure that small businesses have help in navigating to the outcomes that they want.","The morale when I came in was not the best. It was because the agency had not been valued.","We see entrepreneurship and small businesses and supply chains as a critical part of the economic growth and competitiveness agenda.","One of the most important things we hear is the S.B.A. needs to be ubiquitous. We do all these things, but people still don't know.","I think we've learned that the S.B.A. plays a critical role in providing access and opportunity when the market is not providing that access. We help banks get that money out into the hands of important and viable businesses, particularly those owned by minorities, women, immigrants and veterans.","We've gotten tremendous support. Everybody now understands how critical it is to help small businesses get out of this recession and into recovery.","Among our responsibilities is to make sure that 23 percent of all government contracts go to small businesses. That's about $150 billion annually, from all the government agencies.","As you probably know, half of the people who work in this country work for small businesses. And it's more than that, because two out of every three net new jobs come from small business. So we mean it when we talk about small business being the engine for the economy.","Small businesses have told us that having cash in their pocket is one of the primary things that they need.","Small businesses want things streamlined, and one of the great successes we're having is less paperwork, faster turnaround times.","Small businesses pay 18 percent more than big businesses for health care, the same health care, just because they're small and they have too small a pool of risk.","I recently had the opportunity to participate in Inc.'s first-ever 'Hire Power Awards' event in Washington, D.C. The event was a testament to the power of American entrepreneurship and the role that it plays in driving job creation and innovation in a wide array of industries.","One of the most important tools we have at the Small Business Administration (SBA) to reach high growth entrepreneurs is the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program.","Small businesses are really the engine in the economy.","We are not going to be the agency where large businesses can masquerade as a small business and get a contract. We are closing down on fraud, waste and abuse.","My family was in two businesses - they were in the textile business, and they were in the candy business. The conversations around the dinner table were all about the factory floor and how many machines were running and what was happening in the business. I grew up very engaged in manufacturing and as part of a family business.","President Obama vowed in his State of the Union address to make assisting domestic manufacturers a top priority for his second term.","The S.B.A. does not lend directly to businesses, but instead backs loans to encourage banks to invest in small businesses as part of a nearly $90 billion portfolio.","If you want to have prosperity here, we really have to see our small businesses able to grow and compete around the world.","I saw the S.B.A. with just enormous potential, and that's what I told the president - this is really a jewel.","The 2009 stimulus law got the ball rolling, allowing the agency to reduce and eliminate fees and raise loan guarantees to 90 percent of the total. I knew that we had the opportunity to use S.B.A. products to fill that gap in a rapid manner, as we ended up doing in the Recovery Act.","Health care is the No. 1 concern of small businesses and the status quo is untenable.","I grew up in a family business... that really has provided the core of my belief in American small business, and in America's ability to grow and operate important businesses that can compete and be successful.","This has always been a small agency with a big mission. But these days, especially, we have to stand up every day, deliver value into the hands of small-business owners and get taxpayers the biggest bang for their buck so that we can help these job creators do what they need to do.","We don't want to give a business that is not going to come through the troubled waters a loan that they can't pay back.","I haven't checked this out yet, but one of our guys told me we have a counselor within 45 minutes to an hour of most small businesses in this country. That's really powerful. I call it our bone structure.","Our economy creates and loses jobs every quarter in the millions. But of the net new jobs, the jobs come from small businesses: both small businesses on Main Street and many of the net new jobs come from high growth, high impact businesses that are located all across the country.","We were able in the Recovery Act to get a program where we increased our loan guarantees to 90 percent. Because we had that program, a bank wouldn't have to take that much risk."],"Karen Morley":["I would have tested the furniture if they'd asked me.","It was all men, and there I was prancing around in gowns that barely got past the censors.","Ford made some of the most progressive pictures.","I did Our Daily Bread for King and that made me popular in the Soviet Union; King was amused by that.","I became a Communist because I fell in love with a man who was a Red and entered the Army to take care of the Fascists, and I knew it would please him if I became one.","I was blacklisted because of this activity, so I'm not a typical anything.","From that time on, I always had the studios on my neck.","I don't like giving speeches - I enjoy sitting on my rump.","And I spoke out on women's rights, like equal pay for equal work."],"Karen O":["Working pretty much nonstop as an artist, the hardest thing is to know what to do with yourself when you have some time off. You struggle with yourself to take a vacation.","I'm not a quitter. I believe in following things through.","For me, California is all about rest, relaxation, space.","I was just totally taken by Michael Jackson when I was a little kid, like everyone else.","Well, Freddie Mercury is a really huge rock star in my head. I've always thought he was just so tough and such an amazing entertainer, really a contradiction in many ways as well. So he was incredible.","I'm in the camp that needs to discover and take risks, sometimes it's with the promise of something special and new, sometimes it's to stay awake, either way it's much more stressful with all the uncertainty but worth the pain in the end.","I feel like there's a hunger in the culture now for the live experience maybe as a counterpoint to the more sort of synthetic lives that we've been living.","Yeah, I can't separate the art from the music and the music from the art. I think that stems from going to school for film first, and kind of stumbling onto music as my career.","Bands that I've loved over the years are the ones that have a certain myth around them.","Being on the road with rock, it's pretty much 90 percent guys.","I feel like every five to seven years I really need to put myself in this position of discomfort and exploration, just to survive. Otherwise I feel like I'm falling asleep, like I'll go crazy if I don't do it.","I plead total ignorance to Led Zeppelin. I am totally in the dark about them.","I love bass, I really do. Bass is ace!","My onstage persona really is a persona, you know, and really the moment I step onstage, it kind of kicks into gear.","I was a complete outsider in high school.","Sophomore records are historically really difficult.","You have to open up on stage.","I'm not a 21-year-old angsty self-destructive rapscallion anymore."],"Karen Robards":["The year I turned 16, I spent the weeks before Christmas dropping hints to my parents about how much I wanted - no, needed - my own transportation.","I love 'The Guardian' series. Bianca St. Ives is one of my favorite heroines ever, and the combination of action, suspense, and romance makes her story pure fun to write.","I grew up with three little brothers. Every Christmas, we'd have piles of toy trucks and Lincoln Logs and G.I. Joes under the tree. Those were for them. For me? My No. 1 favorite present of all time: books. Two or three tall stacks of wonderful stories that I could lose myself in for weeks.","Books are still my favorite present.","For Christmas 1999, my husband surprised me with a trip to Disney World. Along with our boys, we were standing on the roof of the Contemporary Hotel at midnight on New Year's Eve 2000 watching fireworks explode over every amusement park in Orlando. It was a magical way to celebrate the millennial, and a never-to-be-forgotten Christmas present.","My books are about ordinary people caught up in extraordinary situations.","When I was in law school, there was a used book store nearby. I picked up a Harlequin romance and read it. It was stress relieving.","My parents did not encourage romances.","I didn't know how to be a writer. But I thought, 'I can do this.'","I came out of what we romance writers call The Romance Ghetto, because we get so little respect.","To move up to hardcover is a way of getting more attention for my books. It means a lot to me: It means my books are legitimate.","I haven't always felt it was okay to read romance novels. When I was younger, it embarrassed me to be seen with my books, but I've come out of the closet.","The good romances are as good as anything.","I write the best book that I can write each time.","I was in law school at the University of Kentucky and realized I didn't really like law school, so I took a creative writing course for something different.","I thought I was too intellectual to read something like 'Sweet Savage Love.'","I write to please me, and I've been very lucky. It's like playing baseball. You just keep swinging, and eventually you get a hit.","I start writing with only the vaguest idea about who my characters are and what is going to happen, and the characters and plot come into existence as I go. I've tried doing it the other way, but for me, outlining is a waste of time because I never follow the outline.","My method is, I just sit down and write a book.","My orange Persian Mews hangs out with me while I write."],"Karen Salmansohn":["Choose to focus your time, energy and conversation around people who inspire you, support you and help you to grow you into your happiest, strongest, wisest self.","You're not looking for perfection in your partner. Perfection is all about the ego. With soulmate love, you know that true love is what happens when disappointment sets in - and you're willing to deal maturely with these disappointments.","I'm a big believer that your life is basically a sum of all the choices you make. The better your choices, the better opportunity to lead a happy life.","The best things in life are often waiting for you at the exit ramp of your comfort zone.","Do activities you're passionate about - which make your heart and soul feel perky - including things like working out, cooking, painting, writing, yoga, hiking, walking, swimming, being in nature, being around art, or reading inspiring books.","If you're a good choice maker, you can choose the best emotional responses and choose the best new life paths, forward and upward.","In Hinduism, Shiva is a deity who represents transformation. Through destruction and restoration, Shiva reminds us that endings are beginnings, and that our world is constantly undergoing a cycle of birth, death and rebirth.","I believe much of the pain of a breakup comes from having a life plan that you have fallen in love with. When it does not work out, you become angry that you now have to pursue a new life plan.","The grass is always greener on the other side - until you get there and see it's AstroTurf. Symbols are never reality. Someone might have amassed material success and fame, but that doesn't mean they're happy. So, don't go judging a person's life by the cover.","Stop allowing yourself to focus on depressing life circumstances - including focusing on being depressed about your weight. All this negative focus will only lead you to feeling bummed and wanting to pig out. Instead, consciously focus on happy life circumstances you enjoy doing, and create more of them!","Cultivate the habit of zest. Purposefully seek out the beauty in the seemingly trivial. Especially in the trivial. The colors and shapes of the foods you eat. The shadows a vase makes on your table. The interesting faces of the people on the bus with you.","Imagine feeling like every kiss goodbye to your loved ones each day might be your last kiss. Police officers and their families feel this way every single day.","Stop bragging about your lack of sweat and effort in achieving your goals. Start bragging about how hard you work, how patient you've become.","Have you recently been through a challenge, disappointment, break up or disloyalty with somebody in your life? If so, it's important after you've been hurt, to take some time to think like a lion tamer about your pain, so you can tame the possibility of more negativity coming back to bite you again!","Altruism raises your mood because it raises your self-esteem, which increases happiness. Plus, giving to others gets you outside of yourself and distracts you from your problems.","Basically, a bad breakup is never meant to teach you 'I'll never fall in love again.' It's meant to teach you 'Now I better know what makes for healthful, happy love - and thanks to this breakup I'm now better able to recognize it and snag it!'","A soulmate is someone who you could spend a great deal of time with just sitting on a sofa and feel happy. You don't need fanfare. You don't need to go out to expensive restaurants.","If your partner is angry with you, recognize that his anger is a misdirected plea for love. Your partner's simply upset because he feels something you said or did was a sign of not loving him enough.","I'm doing my best to mindfully raise my son to feel safe and encouraged to express himself.","A soulmate is someone whom, when you meet, without thinking - without letting your neocortex play into the decision - you feel an instant familiarity, a sense of connection, a longing.","Whenever you choose power over love, you will never find true happiness.","When you feel stuck in a hard time, jump-start a pro-change attitude by letting go of possessions that no longer work for you - like old clothes and old shoes.","Dumped? Fired? Scorned? Humiliated? Totally pissed off? If so, I've got great news! You might be on your way to living your best life ever - if you consciously choose to channel this pain into fuel - and use it to motivate yourself to become your highest potential self!","The best relationship is one that does not foster too much independence nor too much dependence, but exists in the healthy interdependence zone.","You know you're living with the habit of zest if you purposefully choose the scenic route to wherever you are going. Or you choose clothing because you love the texture of the fabric. Or you pick a shampoo or cleaning product because you love the smell - smell being just as important to you as how the product works.","In general, being likeable is more about being interested - rather than interesting. Indeed, a good way to convince someone that you are an awesome conversationalist is to simply shut up and let the other person talk.","When it comes right down to it, whatever business you're in, you're in the people business. After all, people prefer to do business with people and companies they find likeable.","Religious people are simply following major core practices of happy people. For example, one benefits from the guaranteed social support that can be found in a church, synagogue, or mosque.","Each day, you can awake and focus on small, easy goals you can accomplish in the short term - goals that, over time, will lead you to your long-term goal.","I believe whoever has the most energy wins. You need energy to win at your relationship, win in your career, win as a parent, win at being your highest potential self.","I admit that when challenging times first surface, it's not first instinct to do a happy dance. But when you take time to pause and add insight to injury, you will immediately start to feel empowered to make those majorly needed life shifts.","Personally, I know how challenging it can be to find free time in today's uber-busy, espresso-chugging world to tend to our spirits, to nourish our souls.","Babies choose to lackadaisically notice the quirkiest of details - unlike us grown ups, who choose instead to focus on what we believe is most essential to us. As a result, babies have a greater expanded consciousness than us grown-ups!","If you want to love your life more, you can begin by living and loving more of it - by zestfully living and loving every teeny-tiny, gorgeously-detailed minutiae moment!","During difficult times, it's best to cut down on sweets like cookies, cake and candy. Satisfy your sweet tooth with fruit to help prevent blood sugar dips and spikes.","Volunteering is a great way to look outside your own problems. Giving back to makes you happier by both giving you a sense of purpose and helping to put your problems in perspective.","The more you stay with and/or complain about a toxic person, the more you're merely delaying doing the important inner work you need to do - to heal your wounds, expand your limiting beliefs, and show yourself far more love and respect.","Only allow yourself to think negative thoughts and/or complain about anything for three minutes, three times a day.","Not only are police officers often taken for granted, many people are highly vocal about their dislike for cops.","All my life, my immediate response to emotional pain has been to make jokes. Lots of jokes.","It's so essential to happiness to speak your truth out loud - because this sharing of your core pain is what creates a necessary healing shift - from negative beliefs about the world - to positive beliefs - and frees you up to be able to fully view life with meaning, purpose and connection with others.","I believe we are our own inner hand - the godly power resides within each of us to create the lives we desire - no matter what the challenges!","A lot of people love to do affirmations first thing in the morning - to keep themselves feeling peppy and positive.","Wherever there's an all-encompassing 'always,' 'all' or 'never' in your life, it's a sign that your mischievous subconscious is setting you up for failure by consistently leading you back toward these repeat performances.","I believe a lot of what contributes to the sadness and downward-spiraling in our lives is a sense of hopelessness. We become resentful when circumstances aren't unfolding as we want, leading us to doubt whether we will ever get what we want.","Watching TV produces low levels of satisfaction because it doesn't challenge you. Instead, do something that raises your self-esteem. Tap into your 'signature strengths' - things you're good at or passionate about.","When you have a 'solution thinking mindset' - and choose to focus 80% of your thoughts/words on solutions - you will not only be heading more speedily to long-term success, but you will immediately feel better in the moment.","Indeed, many of life's most fun and pleasurable choices come with potential dangers. It's important for my son to grow up recognizing that what might appear exciting or inviting at first glance could also have eventual negative consequences.","Insight enables you make sure you don't allow negative beliefs to get permanently set in your thinking - just the same way you wouldn't want fractured bones to be permanently set into place.","Remember: You are the common denominator in all your relationship problems. Wherever you go, your pesky repeated issues go - until you shed a blazing light of insight upon them.","Since I began my practice of Forgiveness Therapy, it's now instinctual for me to choose to eat like I love myself - instead of eating like I wanted to punish myself. Plus I've not only lost weight, I've lost the anger and anxiety I was feeling, and so I feel happier and calmer within.","Nothing in your past is in your present making you do anything you don't choose to do. You are not your past history! You are not your past failures! You are not how others have at one time treated you! You are only who you are and what you do now in this moment.","When you follow your heart's calling, you wind up becoming your most powerful self. You don't need to take power from others if you can tap into your own inner power.","When you're warm and approachable, you don't have to go up and talk non-stop to someone in a social situation. You just have to be open to the conversations you're already having - and warm and receptive to the people you're meeting.","Your subconscious's goal is to recreate unresolved childhood issues and then hopefully mend them.","Personally, I believe people who have a lots of memories are people who are living with zest.","Is an out-of-control life challenge making you feel 'out of control' over your entire life? If so, stop lying around doing nothing. Stop sleeping late. Stop watching too much TV. Start recognizing that this lack of a disciplined schedule will only increase your feelings of being out of control of your life.","I describe a soulmate as a 'soul-nurturing mate' - someone who nurtures your soul - thereby promoting insight and growth.","If you ever want to tame your inner demons, you must consciously choose never to become too attached to any particular life plan - and always remain open to the idea that there might be an even better life plan for you.","Take the time today to understand your contribution to any bad event you've just been through.","Often, overeating is a way to punish yourself for the anger and resentment you're feeling - either at yourself or someone else.","I recognized that I needed to re-train my brain to stop eating like I wanted to punish myself or punish someone else. I needed to re-learn how to eat like I loved myself, and want to nourish and support myself.","Chances are you're using overeating as a way to escape yourself. It's an attempt not to feel or think about what you really need to feel and face.","I feared vulnerability more than my actual emotional pain itself!","I'm lucky I live near Whole Foods... so if I'm hungry, I can walk in there and grab something yummy... already made... or make it myself. I love to cook. I make a killer marinara sauce.","The more you believe that you deserve healthy love, the more you will conquer and attract.","I believe we create a lot of problems in our relationships if we don't feel safe to talk about our feelings at the speed of life.","In many ways, anger is a misdirected plea for love.","I want my son to become aware that he is in charge of the choices he makes, and it's good to make thoughtful, good choices.","When you feel bad on the inside, you wind up wanting to do things to make others feel bad. In contrast, when you feel happy on the inside, you want to do things to make others feel happy.","Power might feel tasty and good in the moment, but it will never be satisfying, never fill you up. Yep, no matter how much power you get, you will always feel empty. You just keep wanting more and more power.","When you start to prioritize hiring likable people within your organization, these likable people will attract other likable people.","I believe you can never fail in life or love. You just produce results. It's up to you how you interpret those results.","I believe that often people even stay in bad relationships longer than they should because the fear of the pain of dating is scarier than the pain of a bad relationship!","Marriage counselors in particular all strongly recommend divorcees try to understand their role in a divorce before re-marrying. Statistics show if you re-marry before you've clearly seen things from the biter's point of view - you're re-bounded to fail again!","I'm a huge fan of meditation. I know lots of people assume meditation to be some Buddhist mumbo-jumbo, but it's been scientifically documented to create therapeutic changes in the brain.","It seems every morning I wake up to face a list of 20 things to do, with time only to do 10, and somehow I always wind up squishing in 30.","The next time you find yourself racing quickly down the street, know that you're not only running to your next appointment, you are literally running from contact with your truest feelings, deepest needs and most valuable insights.","Basically, discipline, effort, patience and courage are hugely important core values for kids to grow up embracing.","It's not enough to just mildly want what you want. You must wildly want what you want. Nobody ever got their greatest wishes by being wishy-washy. You need to put extreme energy into your power of intention to win what you wanna win.","If you feel sick and tired of how things are in your life, chances are it's because you're making yourself sick and tired - by engaging in too many energy leaking things.","Over time, we amass limiting beliefs about how life supposedly is - beliefs that are not valid. Then we allow these limiting beliefs to stop us from fully living our happiest lives.","Basically, Aristotle believed that every time you behaved unkind and immorally - performing actions your soul was not proud of - you tarnished your soul. The worst shape your soul became in, the worst shape your mood and spirit.","Basically, it's in your best mental interest to release your anger so you can see the world more clearly around you and seek better solutions for finding the happy, love-filled life you desire and deserve.","If you're human, you've had phases in your life when things are in flux.","I'm a big believer in the power of visualizations. And so are neuroscientists. Numerous studies have proven how merely imagining positive circumstances sends blood flowing from negative brain regions to positive ones.","I hate to wait. When I want something, I want it now.","If you want to lose weight, you must make sure your appetite for life is far bigger than your appetite for mere food.","Every food I choose to eat helps me become more conscious of how it either moves me forward to my fab weight or backward to my flab weight.","Our built-in human system for mimicry explains why we humans can transfer our good and bad moods to each other - if we aren't careful!","Numerous studies have shown how when one person in a romantic coupling gets depressed, the other becomes more depressed.","If your partner is consistently unhappy, it won't matter if they're incredibly sexy, wildly funny, impressively successful, adorably charismatic - your relationship will be weighed down under the heaviness of their moods.","Don't try to convince your partner you are right. Instead of trying to win arguments, try to have a winning relationship!","Studies show when people yell, they get themselves even angrier. Interesting factoid: If you and/or your partner's heartbeat becomes higher than 100 beats per minute during an argument, you will not be able to fully understand/process what the other is saying.","I've come to realize I'm more spiritual than I am religious. What I mean by this: As far as praying to God goes, I'm more about looking inside for inner guidance - tapping into our own abundantly powerful inner resources - which, I suppose, is where some might say God does indeed reside.","Instead of asking God to remove our problems so that our lives might be happy, we must purposefully try to learn as much as we can - and thereby become happier due to our insights and growth.","Breaking up is hard to do... so it's essential to keep getting wiser - and wiser - about what healthy love is all about.","You must remind yourself: The #1 reason to merge your life with a man is that he makes you feel happier - not more anxious and depressed.","Are you used to entertaining everyone with your tales of drama and conflict? Do you get attention and feel important every time you complain about how awful this man is? Stop settling for attention for the negative stuff in your life.","I firmly believe caretaking the soul is incredibly important for happiness."],"Karen Thompson Walker":["There's a pleasure in being reminded of the value of ordinary life.","A good story, just like a good sentence, does more than one job at once. That's what literature is: a story that does more than tell a story, a story that manages to reflect in some way the multilayered texture of life itself.","I wake up fairly early every day, by 8, for sure. Sunday is a lighter writing day than the weekdays, but I still wake up and write for about an hour, beginning right around 8. I definitely have coffee first, and then I start writing. I do think it's kind of hard to get the right level of concentration without coffee.","Feeling earthquakes was part of growing up, and also preparing for them: doing earthquake drills, or having earthquake supplies. The looming feeling was part of my life. My experience of earthquakes has always been more the fear of them, or the possibility.","To some degree we all live with uncertainty. We have no control over the future. Yet we carry on, we persevere, because, I guess, it's the way we're made.","I tend to mostly take the day off from working on Sundays, but I do spend some time reading. Mostly what I'm picking up is what's in stores. I really do love to read fiction from the last year or two.","I'm an only child, and I think one of the sweet things about that is that my parents are really interested in every aspect of my life.","Fear is... a kind of unintentional storytelling that we are all born knowing how to do.","Our fears are an amazing gift of the imagination... a way of glimpsing what might be the future when there's still time to influence how that future will play out.","Just like all great stories, our fears focus our attention on a question that is as important in life as it is in literature: What will happen next?","Sometimes I think I might not have written 'The Age of Miracles' if I hadn't grown up in California, if I hadn't been exposed to its very particular blend of beauty and disaster, of danger and denial.","I left my job in the fall, and now I can set my life up around writing instead of squeezing writing into my day; it's amazing to have that time, and I feel very lucky.","It took me years to learn that sentences in fiction must do much more than stand around and look pretty.","I first started writing fiction in college because I was attracted to beautiful sentences. I loved to read them. I wanted to write them.","These days, I like to think of sentences as workers. Only one of their jobs is to look and sound good. Sentences are the carriers of plot. They're the conjurers of images, the conveyors of tone and meaning and voice. The best sentences surprise us.","I fell in love with Virginia Woolf in college. I especially admire how well she writes about daily life, how she captures so much meaning and consequence in the smallest details of a day.","If I read a scary story in the newspaper, I find I'm haunted by it.","I feel like writing a book there's always a version in your head that's an amazing version, but then you write the version that you can write.","I love conventional apocalypse movies. In movies, I like to be with the president, or the scientist trying to solve the problem, but that's not the kind of fiction that I like to read.","In general, I think I'm quick to worry about disasters of all kinds.","I was a book editor for nine years. I'm familiar with the opposite experience, bracing myself for the likelihood that no one would want to publish my book.","End-of-the-world stories tend to ring true. I've always been drawn to them, but as I wrote my own, I found surprising pleasure in creating a world that is so radically changed, yet where there's so much meaning and value in every small and ordinary thing we have, and take for granted: hot showers, enough food, friends, routines.","I can write all the way through the morning, when my mind is clear, and there are no distractions.","The books I love most are the ones that combine some sort of gripping story with really beautiful or stylish writing. Some of my favorites are 'The Road' by Cormac McCarthy, 'The Virgin Suicides' by Jeffrey Eugenides, 'The Interpreter of Maladies' by Jhumpa Lahiri, and 'Blindness' by Jose Saramago.","I like to edit my sentences as I write them. I rearrange a sentence many times before moving on to the next one. For me, that editing process feels like a form of play, like a puzzle that needs solving, and it's one of the most satisfying parts of writing.","Sentences or solutions occur to me in the shower, or while running on the treadmill, or riding on the subway.","As an editor, I read Charlotte Rogan's amazing debut novel, 'The Lifeboat,' when it was still in manuscript. I read it in one night, and I really wanted my company to publish it, but we lost it to another house. It's such a wonderful combination of beautiful writing and suspenseful storytelling.","Shortly after the 2004 Indonesian earthquake, I read that the earthquake had affected the rotation of the earth, shortening the length of our 24-hour day. Even though the change was extremely slight - only a few microseconds - I found the idea incredibly haunting."],"Karen Traviss":["My books deliberately provide no answers or messages. I'm drilled in the habit of objectivity and also aware that the steady drip of fiction has more power than facts to shape opinion, so I handle it with caution.","People lose it when I say this, but I'm a novelist who doesn't read novels. There are lots of good reasons for not reading novels! I'm also a game writer who doesn't play games - I keep everything very separate. The only crossover with me is comics. I write them, and I read them passionately.","Games are getting more interesting. I mean, when we talk about books, they can be anything from a summer blockbuster to 'War and Peace' - well, games are the same. I think the creative side is catching up with the technology.","The thing about games is, players often say they don't care about story, but then if you took the story out, what would their reaction be? If no one cared about story, we'd all still be playing Pac-Man. There's nothing wrong with Pac-Man, but the point is, there's a genre of games in which you want to become part of that world.","I'm a visual person - when I write, my input is always visual. I worked in television for several years.","I'm still an old-school reporter at heart. Writing fiction satisfies my journalistic need to hear and relay the testimony of everyday people at the center of events.","Whether I build a character from the ground up or develop one, whether within my own copyright or in licensed work, I can step into that character's mind. It takes a kind of voluntary dissociation akin to method acting, military planning, marketing, or detective work: to think like the other guy and work out what he's going to do next.","All the things worth writing about are outside me. I'm a lens, not a source. And even if it's not always a comfortable journey, it's always a stimulating one.","If you go back and look at the early promos for Gears 1, you'll see just how different the characters were from the actual first game, both in appearance and background. And it's an evolutionary process.","The art of storytelling is in development, not fact sheets. There are posts you have to hammer into the ground from the start just to get going, but if they don't hold up the house you build, you can change them or take them out.","I love being pushed out of my comfort zone.","I've got a particular way of writing novels, and that carries over into the way I write comics and games, too. I'm a news journalist by background, so I approach everything as reporting - I treat it as real, I ask the questions I'd ask in a real situation, and I let the characters speak for themselves.","I'd probably play games obsessively if I didn't write, although I admit I don't read novels partly because I don't enjoy it, not just because it's the wrong side of the creator-consumer barrier for me. I'm a visual writer. I think in moving 3D images and write down what I observe.","I do still read comics since I started writing for DC, but nowhere near as much as I used to, and I'm finding now that it's becoming harder to read comics as a consumer, so I think I'll have to make the call there and stop reading them.","The biggest battles in human history can only ever be seen through the eyes of the bloke on the front line, and that's by definition a very focused view and one that will vary from individual to individual.","G.I. Joe has a heart and an attitude that feels right and familiar to me, so they could have ray guns, and they'd still feel more like real troops than many other franchises.","I still have a lot of military contacts, and friends and readers who've served or are serving, and they react really strongly to G.I. Joe. I've lost count of the number who've said, 'Oh, I just loved it as a kid. I had all the figures; it really made me think.'","A novel can do something that films and TV usually can't - a glimpse inside the characters' heads. I write very tight third person point of view, so the reader is right behind the eyes of each character, seeing what they see and feeling what they feel.","Writing is like a rollercoaster ride for me, an adventure. I love exploring the world through 'playing' people who are absolutely nothing like me.","Characters have changed my mind about some very fundamental moral issues, and that's the real satisfaction in the way I write - the ultimate learning experience.","Recreating the experience of, say, bereavement in my own head is pretty rough. I was used to switching off from emotions every day of my working life as a journalist, but in fiction, you have to feel it 100%, or else it's a flat experience for the reader."],"Kari Matchett":["I've always been into sports and yoga and running. I actually study a martial arts self-defense program called Krav Maga. I can't quite say it's easy, but it's fun for me and I love to do it.","I would love to do some more comedy. I would love to do some silliness. I would love to do some characters that have greater vulnerability.","We're not one thing, as human beings, so any character that is written uni-dimensional, that's just a shallow character with shallow writing and shallow acting.","I always did plays. When I was in kindergarten, I got chosen to be Alvin in 'The Chipmunks.' We did a Chipmunks song. I was always a natural performer. It was easy for me. I danced and I sang, and all that stuff. I felt like I'd be something in the arts, but it vacillated between being a dancer and a singer, or whatever.","If only I could step back into the time of old movies, if only I could be given the opportunity to do what Katharine Hepburn did or what Rosalind Russell did. Those kinds of characters, that kind of patter, that kind of language, that kind of script. They don't exist any more."],"Kari Wahlgren":["I love cartoons, I love comic books and graphic novels. 'Batman: The Animated Series' was a huge influence on me when I was younger.","I always knew that I wanted to do voiceovers as part of my career. I just kind of didn't expect it to take off the way it did. I couldn't be happier. I love the chance to play so many different characters every day.","The people that are fans of animation are really the people that are keeping the art form of animation alive. If you like cartoons, support the cartoons.","I'm a huge Wonder Woman fan - I have about 12 coffee mugs at home!"],"Kari Wuhrer":["I wanna create a character that's really memorable... like Julia Roberts did in 'Pretty Woman.'","I'm the queen of the independent video!","My body is my greatest asset."],"Karin Fossum":["I use the setting of a small rural Norwegian community - the kind of place that I know so intimately. I could never write a novel set in a big city, because, frankly, I don't know what it would be like.","I have experienced a murderer among my friends. Many, many years ago. At close range I have seen the impact of it. I knew the victim, I went to the funeral, I have been to the house, to the specific room where the killing took place, and I was stunned by it. It's such a blow.","I'm not a good crime writer. I'm not good with plots... so I have to do something else.","Mankind can be very magnanimous, given the chance.","It is hard work to give life to new characters every single day. It is not as if I am God. I am just a tired, middle-aged woman trying to keep going.","I believe I could commit a crime. We all can. It depends on which situations we find ourselves in. In despair, I would steal food if my children were hungry.","Successful people are not interesting. I feel for the losers. That's where my heart lies."],"Karin Slaughter":["I love twins stories.","Even if you live in a big city, everybody lives in a small town. We identify ourselves by our neighborhoods - 'I live in the Village, or in Chelsea.'","I love puns. I've been known to turn the car around just to take advantage of a good pun situation. It really is the highest form of humor.","Every writer I know got their start in a library somewhere. We read a book, and we thought, 'I want to do that.'","I am hard-pressed to find a successful writer who doesn't have a similar story to mine - transformation through the public library.","I think crime fiction is a great way to talk about social issues, whether 'To Kill A Mockingbird' or 'The Lovely Bones;' violence is a way to open up that information you want to get out to the reader.","I think some people are good at being alone, and some people aren't, and as a child, I really liked it.","If I wasn't a writer, I would probably be a watchmaker. I like putting puzzles together, and that is what a watch is, figuring out how all the gears and everything else works together. I'm patient and good at focusing on a single task.","Reading develops cognitive skills. It trains our minds to think critically and to question what you are told. This is why dictators censor or ban books. It's why it was illegal to teach slaves to read. It's why girls in developing countries have acid thrown in their faces when they walk to school.","Good writers know that crime is an entre into telling a greater story about character. Good crime writing holds up a mirror to the readers and reflects in a darker light the world in which they live.","Anyone who's been to high school with teenage girls knows how horrible girls can be.","Libraries are the backbone of our education system.","Women who write thrillers are called 'dark.' Male writers are called 'powerful.'","I know the cadence of the language and the voice of Atlanta because I've lived here for so long.","Even 'Gone With the Wind' had a shocking, cold-blooded murder.","Books give us insight into other people, other cultures. They make us laugh. They make us think. If they are really good, they make us believe that we are better for having read them. You don't read a book - you experience it. Every story opens up a new world.","My sister is dyslexic, and she's so smart, so intelligent in all of the ways that matter.","Growing up in Georgia in the southeastern United States, I was always reading and always kept to myself. I never felt isolated, though; I just liked being alone.","We make assumptions: nurses should be nice, teachers should be good. But everyone has a dark side, some darker than others.","Graphic novels let you take risks that just wouldn't fly in the conventional book form.","There's a tendency among some male writers to make the women in their stories weak and needing of rescue so that their hero looks like a manly man.","Reading is exercise for our brains in the guise of pleasure. Books give us insight into other people, other cultures. They make us laugh. They make us think. If they are really good, they make us believe that we are better for having read them.","I always say 'thriller;' if they see you're a woman - and you're a blond woman - people assume you're writing about cats and romances where somebody has died.","It sounds pretentious to say I 'divide' my time, but when I am home, that usually means my house in Atlanta or my cabin in the North Georgia Mountains. The latter is where I do the majority of my writing.","My typical morning involves some time on the treadmill, but obviously I skip that a lot. Mostly, I wake up, check my email, then get to work on the various interviews and questions and phone calls that come with being an author.","I'm extremely introverted. I used to think it was shyness, but I got over that, so it must be door No. 2. It's still hard for me to be away from home much, and I have to make sure I get lots of time alone in my room when I'm touring.","As a Southerner, I love obstacles for my characters.","When I was little, my grandmother would take me to church with her, and she would introduce me to people.","I read extensively about serial killers and all sorts of things people get up to.","I never felt isolated; I just liked being alone. I think that some people are good at being alone, and some people aren't, and as a child, I really liked it.","When I'm on a good go, I can do 12, 13 hours of writing.","I could type in a closet and be fine. It's just a matter of cocooning myself. Just me and the story.","Feminism has been so co-opted, but the fact is, feminism benefits men as well.","Flannery O'Connor was a revelation for me. When I read her, I was very young, and I didn't understand what she was doing. I didn't see any of the Catholicism or any of the social stuff.","I'm really boring. I get up early. I go to bed early. I don't smoke or drink. I mean, I'll eat a cupcake. I'm just not a crazy, stay-out-all-night sort of person. I love writing.","I certainly went to high school with some mean girls, and I would not wish that hell on anybody.","My job isn't to preach to people, it's to entertain them. I like letting the characters speak for themselves.","When I was growing up, my stepmother's sister was the chief detective in one of the adjoining towns, so she piqued my interest in crime.","The most enduring stories in literature generally have some kind of crime at their center, whether it's the bloody butchery of 'Hamlet,' the lecherous misanthropes of Dickens or the lone gunman from 'The Great Gatsby.'","Pushing the boundaries of polite society does not just fall under the purview of crime fiction authors.","I have a lot of men who will say to me, 'I don't read books by women, but I like you.'","Like every Southern writer, I thought that I needed to write the next 'Gone With the Wind.'","I've always been drawn to historical fiction.","When you read a book, you are letting another person distract your thoughts and work your emotions. If they are adept, there's nothing better than turning off and getting lost.","People forget that writers start off being readers. We all love it when we find a terrific read, and we want to let people know about it.","I didn't want to spend the next thirty years writing about bad things happening in the same small town - not least of all because people would begin to wonder why anyone still lives there!","I paid for my name a lot when I was growing up because other kids teased me.","My books are never about the crimes. They are about how the characters react to the crimes.","I think being a woman and writing frankly about violence has gotten me some attention, and as someone who wants people to read my books, I can't complain about that attention, but it does puzzle me that this is something reviewers focus on.","I taped the autopsy photos from Marilyn Monroe's death to my lunch box in fifth grade, and I would write stories in which someone inevitably died.","I set the goal of getting a book contract by age thirty.","I have a few unusual fans, as you can imagine, so I try to protect the privacy of my home life.","I can clearly trace my passion for reading back to the Jonesboro, Georgia, library, where, for the first time in my life, I had access to what seemed like an unlimited supply of books.","Prior to the Civil War, most libraries were either privately owned or housed in universities or churches.","Books are not like albums, where you can simply download and enjoy your favorite chapter and ignore the rest.","Being a Southerner, I'm interested in sex, violence, religion and all the things that make life interesting.","My dad believed in scaring us as we were growing up. Scaring the boys who wanted to date us more.","I've always been interested in violence, even as a teenager. I loved 'Helter Skelter' and books like that.","I think that characters who are nice all the time and who you sympathize with can get really boring.","Everybody had something horrible happen to them at one time or another in their life.","I think a lot of people are curious about what makes people do what they do, and I guess my curiosity isn't hidden in any way.","I read about violent things. I think what I get out of that is entertainment by learning about different things, and reading the genre and getting an understanding of motivations. But at the end of the day, it's still a book, and I can walk away.","I busted my chin open trying to be Evel Knievel on my bike. When it happened, you could see straight through to the bone, I thought my dad was going to pass out. It left a scar that I still have now.","It's hard because people often don't recognise shyness; they think it's just someone being rude. I have had to work to overcome that, especially if I'm meeting my readers at author events, because I don't want them to think I'm snooty or rude.","If you wear them outside, they stop being pyjamas. I wear mine to the mail box, which is right in front of my house - that's my limit. Anything else is wrong.","Reading is power. Reading is life.","As voters and taxpayers, we must demand that our local governments properly prioritize libraries. As citizens, we must invest in our library down the street so that the generations served by that library grow up to be adults who contribute not just to their local communities but to the world.","I think a lot of guys who are on the Internet a lot, they're kind of anesthetized to some of the violent language and all that because they see it all the time.","People don't just love mysteries. They are obsessed with them - especially the kind that are never definitively solved.","Crafting a piece of gripping, narrative true crime that engages the world is not that different from crafting a piece of crime fiction.","The most important lesson I have learned from spending years talking to law enforcement officers is that the vast majority of them really want to do a good job. They have a physical need to do a good job. And yet, we don't give them the resources that would help them.","Prosecutors and public defenders deserve to make a living wage.","I think chalking up human behavior to evil lets us all off the hook too easily.","I write fifteen hours a day, stopping at Oprah-o'clock.","I'm going to name a name: Janet Evanovich. She writes the same book over and over, and I read every single one of them and eagerly anticipate them.","It's just my goal to deliver the best story I can, and I want to make sure each book is better than the last, and in order to do that, I have to take chances.","Men are more particular, and they're not going to grab something with a bodice-ripper cover on it.","I've always been drawn to dark stories. I enjoy reading Flannery O'Connor, Patricia Highsmith, and Margaret Mitchell.","I love reading almost as much as I love writing.","Most of my books begin with a nap on my couch here, when I dream up characters and story lines, and then I write on my laptop in the recliner and handle the business side of email at my desk, which is sagging in the middle - maybe from so many words?","Oh, I'm completely OCD about neatness.","It was always my dream to write for a living.","I always wanted to be a writer. In the beginning, I thought I had to rewrite 'Gone with the Wind,' but eventually, I found my way and realized that wasn't me.","I grew up reading thrillers. Honestly, I was always drawn to the very detailed ones like Patricia Cornwell. I love details.","If you're going to write thrillers, you have to make a decision if you are going to be realistic or go off and over.","Women know how to scare other women.","Southerners have this love of embellishment. Even when you read a police report, there's some backstory.","Random House is definitely invested in keeping libraries healthy.","It seems like women are always told, 'It is not your time.'","Women can be two different people - one person at home, another at work.","I thought I had to write literature and add my name to the list of great Southern storytellers. Fortunately for me, no one wanted to read any of those stories. They got rejected by everyone. Sometimes, I would get a note saying they liked the writing, but the story simply didn't work.","I grew up in a small town in Georgia where nothing bad happened - it was like Mayberry.","I never want to write a book just to tell a story. There is always something deeper going on.","Visual storytelling is at once immediate and subversive.","Librarians have always stood up for writers and readers in every kind of community across this country.","Denise Mina is probably one of the most gifted writers out there, whether it's mystery or literary or whatever label you want to give it.","Jack Reacher is one of the sexiest characters in fiction.","For many children, the library represents their only access to books, reading, and the Internet outside of their home. If you think about how far behind a child would be without access to these fundamental tools - tools that are vital to successful employment later in life - it's a travesty.","Equal access to reading is fundamental to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.","I grew up having the library as the best place ever. I spent a lot of weekends there as a kid - my parents would drop me off and leave me there all day. I would just sit in the back and read whatever I could find.","When I became a published writer, I said, 'Whatever I can do to help the libraries I want to do,' so all of my book tours since then have involved me coming to a library and talking about how important libraries are for a community.","I started Save the Libraries in 2010 by hosting a big fundraiser in my city library of DeKalb County in Atlanta. Through that, I learned that even with fundraisers, libraries often don't make money - they just barely break even.","No matter where you are on the political spectrum, libraries make sense. It's such a small investment. Every dollar supporting a library system returns five dollars to the community.","My father and his eight siblings grew up in the kind of poverty that Americans don't like to talk about unless a natural disaster like Hurricane Katrina strikes, and then the conversation only lasts as long as the news cycle. His family squatted in shacks. The children scavenged for food.","When you grow up starving, you cannot point with pride to a book you've just spent six hours reading. Picking cotton, sewing flour bags into clothes - those were the skills my father grew up appreciating.","'Encyclopedia Brown Takes the Case,' 'The Secret of the Old Clock,' 'Are You There God, It's Me, Margaret,' 'Flowers in the Attic,' 'Gone With the Wind' - these are the books that defined my childhood. They thrilled me. They made me feel like I wasn't alone in the world.","Though he was not a reader himself, my father understood that reading is not just an escape. It is access to a better way of life.","With 'Pretty Girls,' I saw the opportunity to talk not just about crime but what crime leaves behind.","Usually, when inspiration strikes late, the light of day reveals that I haven't gotten an idea for a book so much as a psychiatric case study.","As the youngest of three girls, most of my childhood works were revenge fantasies against my older sisters, so of course the sisters in 'Pretty Girls' share some similarities to my own.","As awful as crime can be, it's what happens afterward - the struggling to get out of bed, to put one foot in front of the other - that alters people.","No crime lab in the world looks like the 'CSI' ones because there's simply not the money for all those fancy machines.","There aren't many people in the world who can say that they are doing the job they've wanted to do since childhood, so in that regard, I feel incredibly fortunate.","I'm over the word 'like' in conversation, and 'you know' seems to be the placeholder of choice, but when I'm writing dialogue, I tend to use those phrases because that's how people talk.","I've never purposefully based a character on any one person I know, but I'm certain there are amalgamations that exist.","I can clearly trace my passion for reading back to the Jonesboro, Georgia, library, where for the first time in my life I had access to what seemed like an unlimited supply of books. This was where I discovered 'Encyclopedia Brown' and 'Nancy Drew,' 'Gone With the Wind' and 'Rebecca.' This was where I became inspired to be a writer.","If there is still an American dream, reading is one of the bootstraps by which we can all pull ourselves up.","As much as we would like to deny it, reading is not vital to human survival.","I grew up watching the 'People's Choice Awards.'","I read a lot of true crime growing up - 'The Stranger Beside Me' by Ann Rule about Ted Bundy.","Readers are very, very savvy, and I don't want to insult them by making them think I'm too lazy to get it right.","It's a very Southern thing to be interested in dark stuff.","I have a superhero complex. If I see anything bad happen, I run towards it, rather idiotically because, after all, what could I do?","Flannery O'Connor was a revelation for me. When I read her, I was very young, and I didn't understand what she was doing. I didn't see the - any of the Catholicism or any of the social stuff.","I'm just not a crazy, stay-out-all-night sort of person. I love writing.","I don't get hung up a lot on angst.","I never really fitted in, because I've always been interested in really dark things.","My sister lived in England for a while when I was 12, and I came to visit her, and I spent most of the time in her flat reading.","In the South, we drink the Bible with our mother's milk.","When you write as a woman, there's this feeling there's going to be a softness.","You can take risks with the characters and their development in a standalone novel.","That's why I love crime novels so much: When I write a crime novel, the conflict is built in.","I always want to make sure the book I'm writing is the best book I can deliver.","I want to be a better writer. I want to learn and grow, to know how to tell stories in a different and more challenging way. I've learned it doesn't get easier each time. It actually gets harder.","What I know is the characters in a Southern town. I know the cadence of the language and the voice of Atlanta because I've lived here for so long. And I know the neighborhoods, and I hopefully know the people, and I feel a connection to them. And I also feel like I'm honoring them when I talk about them.","I always try to block out an hour or so a day to read. Being a writer is a job, and reading helps train my brain in the right direction.","Good crime writing holds up a mirror to the readers and reflects in a darker light the world in which they live.","A book I would take with me to a desert island is 'Paradise Lost,' which I studied in college and hated so much by the end of the class that I never wanted to see it again.","The book that first made me want to be a writer is Flannery O'Connor's short story collection 'A Good Man Is Hard To Find.'","I hate to badmouth any book or writer, because I know how it feels to be on the other end of that.","As a writer, I've always felt it's my job to be extremely careful when writing about victims, especially women.","The familiar trope of the woman in peril doesn't really interest me."],"Karina Lombard":["I don't wear perfume, and I rarely wear jewelry.","With me, what you see is what you get."],"Karine Vanasse":["I always worked mostly in Quebec. I never thought of the States, somehow. I don't know - I don't have blue eyes or blond hair. I thought I didn't fit with the stereotype of America.","Gloves make you so much more delicate.","As for the Canadians - good actors and good directors are sometimes taken by the American market, you know, if they're good enough.","You know sometimes it's not the bigger roles that give you the most satisfaction, yeah?","'Polytechnique' changed everything in my way of working. I became an adult, really, during those five years. I didn't work on anything else but 'Polytechnique.'","It's fascinating to see actors who do voiceovers every day.","As an actor, you arrive most of the time at the last minute. You arrive at the end of the process, but you don't realize it.","When I have to promote things now, sometimes I realize that I had a movie in mind, but in the end, it's a vision of somebody else, so I have to promote their idea.","I wasn't really using Twitter before 'Pan Am.' It was a good way to promote the show and be with the viewers on Sunday and be available to them and take questions.","We now know how things were in the '60s and how things have changed, but I don't think we appreciate how much things have changed.","It had always been a dream of mine to come to New York to work. Coming to New York and looking for work is one thing, but coming to New York and already having a job and feeling like you are already part of the city has been an amazing experience for me.","I have a dear friend here in Toronto, Sarah Millman, who has helped me a lot as a stylist.","I'll always love movies. But there's something I love very much about TV, when you shoot episodes while other episodes are still being written.","I love Judy Garland, Shirley Bassey.","When you have a chance to play a character people can relate to, it's rewarding.","I love to fly so much.","I feel so great on a plane that it could be the end of everything, and I don't care."],"Karishma Tanna":["Be beautiful, be stylish, and love yourself.","My biggest concern is people misunderstanding me.","Black is a great colour when it comes to being safe and classy. It looks great on any body type and can be paired with anything. So when in doubt, go for black.","Long kurtas, especially the pink and yellow ones, that I had worn in 'Big Boss 8' - they are very comfortable to wear. You can wear them with a just a belt for your day outings or lunches for stylish and classy look. Or you can also team it up with a churidar and dupatta for an evening outing to look more classy.","I am not a person to compromise on my priorities and family just for a show.","If you have a dream, be brave enough to go and get it!","Fashion, for me, is reviving different things - I like to stand out every time I dress up and what I'm comfortable in. I need to be extremely confident and comfortable in the attire I wear.","I always see everything in a positive light.","For me, the most important things are me, myself, and my family.","I will never create a romantic angle to survive on a game show.","I discovered my love for dancing when I was barely 5-6 years of age. Whenever I would hear any music playing, I would automatically groove to it.","I will only talk about my work. I have always stayed away from commenting on my personal life, and that remains unchanged.","I am sharing screen space with Ranbir Kapoor, but I am not exactly playing Sanjay Dutt's love interest, I am one of his encounters... It's just a cameo, but I would take my role as important, as it is a biopic on Sanjay Dutt, so whatever is important in his life is being shown in the film.","I can never marry an obese guy.","Generally, in Gujarati families, people get married early, and all my friends are married with two kids. My father had told me, 'If you do not find a right partner, do not get married'; that's the advice he has always given me. So, I will never compromise in my marriage.","I feel every artist has a certain amount of fan following.","Even when I was young, with a limited amount of money and exposure, I tried to look my best. I like to follow trends and stand out. I have always had that fashion sense. But with the time, age, money, and experience, I have made a conscious effort to stand out.","I thank God because he has given me work somewhere or the other.","I like Victoria Beckham's fashion sense. In Bollywood, Kangana Ranaut is really out-of-the-box and quirky.","I do feel I have all the qualities of a film star but then why didn't I make it that big? I blame it on my destiny. I was not there at the right place at the right time.","I don't regret being on television; I just regret the fact that I wanted to be in the movies, and that didn't happen.","Have we ever seen Bollywood stars compete among themselves on a platform like 'Jhalak?' It's always TV stars who compete amongst themselves and are judged by Bollywood stars.","I have realised I need to tone down and be easy at times. It is good to be competitive and have a fighting spirit, but one should not go to extremes.","It has to be really interesting for me to perform the same role for 365 days non-stop. It becomes taxing for an actor to perform the same character for 12 hours every day, and then, after a point, there's no growth.","In films, you work for three to six months, and you're out of the character. But for a daily soap, you don't have that luxury. So the character has to be convincing. Otherwise, your mind is not in it, and you're just working for money, which is a good amount in serials. But I want both: good acting and good money.","I'd love to host a reality show now and not be a contestant in it. I want to take a show forward.","'Choli Ke Peeche' and 'Ek Doh Teen' were my favourite numbers as a kid. I was a huge fan of Madhuri Dixit and would spend hours looking into the mirror and aping her expressions, believing that the mirror was the camera!","Whether it's something happy or sad, I like to share everything with my mother.","I don't stuff myself at breakfast and prefer to have a glass of milk and fruit for breakfast. I prefer a home-made vegetarian lunch otherwise.","People assumed that I wasn't open to doing TV, probably because I was doing a film and reality shows. I have become choosy and want to take up substantial roles.","Audiences have taken a liking for supernatural and fantasy shows. The genre is doing well on the small screen, and I wanted to get into that mould. I have never played a naagin, and such roles have always intrigued me.","I think it is important to give your partner enough time in a relationship.","Reality shows can put a lot of stress on you.","I was dancing when I was acting as well. Actors generally dance in performances like in an award function.","It is very difficult for us to establish identity in films. It is not easy to break through your stereotype image from television and form a new identity on the big screen.","I love doing comic roles and believe I am best at it.","In a TV show, you are restricted to a lot of things. On television, you can't put the content you can put on web series and on the channels digitally.","I love things which are different and shows which are different.","I don't know why people feel that I am only interested in films, but I very much want to do fiction. My only prerequisite is a good role, something which satisfies the actor in me. If I get a good banner and a good channel, I would definitely do a daily soap.","I had a lot of fun playing a naagin. It is all fantasy, so it was great.","I think the only thing that is in my hands is to look good, and that is one thing I will do for sure.","If a role demands in a good project, I wouldn't mind wearing a bikini.","I always try to do something different and creative with my dress sense.","Even if you're doing a film, you're in the news while the shooting is on and during promotions. But once it's over, the limelight fades away, and you wait for something better to come your way.","People who call me reality queen or whatever don't help me run my house. If I get a good project, I'll definitely pick it up because today I'm famous; tomorrow, maybe I'd be gone.","I'm very choosy when it comes to work. It's not like whatever comes my way, I will agree to do it. But if I'm getting good money and exposure and if the content is satisfying, what's the harm in doing it, even if it's yet another reality show?","People tend to discuss things like relationships with family and friends, and the fact that I'm the only breadwinner in the family. And honestly, I cashed in on it.","I do feel a bit dejected about my film career. I am sad that it didn't take off as expected. I didn't get my due as an actor. I have an attractive personality and good looks. But I don't know what went wrong? You need to stop thinking about such things and move on.","Even if I don't have a successful film career, at least I am a popular name on TV. I always see the positive side of things. You do feel negative at times, and even humiliated, but if you keep thinking about that, then your life won't move forward.","I took a break from TV for about three-four years. During that time, I had to let go of some of the best shows that were offered to me, as I wanted to focus on films. It was believed that if you are seen too much on TV, you won't get films.","It is my dream to be a Bollywood actor.","Friends do give advice, but in the end, it's up to you. Although I think it is nice to have a guy's perspective on girls' issues in relationships and vice versa.","It's heartening to see talented girls like Prachi Desai and Yami Gautam making it big in films and proving themselves.","I'm not very comfortable about the audience getting a peek into my personal life. I like to keep my personal space.","Like a lot of girls, even I have this dream of being in the movies, and like any actor, I need to grow.","Working with Hirani sir is a big thing for me. At least in my resume, I'll have a mention of his name in my filmography.","I get to pick so many things as an actor. Also, I'm a good observer of people and their mannerisms.","I really like light-hearted and humourous people.","People knew who Karishma Tanna is always, but through 'Bigg Boss,' they know me very well - what kind of a personality I have, what do I do in the morning and what do I do in the evening, what type of clothes I wear, how do I do my hair, how do I do make-up.","I like keeping myself hydrated and taking care of my body, skin, hair... I feel it's good to maintain yourself.","For me, style is something that I'm comfortable in. I don't really follow any trends. I just like to wear things that look good on me and suit my body and personality.","I'd love to do Tamil movies whenever the right script comes by.","I've seen almost all of Rajinikanth sir's movies, at least the ones that have come to Mumbai, since I don't understand Tamil. I loved him in the movie 'Hum' as well.","Sadly, we don't have Gujarati food on sets, but we do love the delicious Rajasthani dal-baati, gatte ki sabzi, and those proper Rajasthani thalis.","I want to concentrate on work and won't do anything to divert my concentration.","Nobody wants to get into controversies, especially in the film industry. I do not wish to be a controversial girl. But sometimes you have to take tough decisions that might eventually help your career.","Overall, I feel that southern cinema, in itself, has taken over the film industry with its content, stories and screenplay.","It is very different hosting and judging a show like 'Love School'; it was unlike acting in a movie or series or being part of a reality show. But I keep telling myself that I have just one life, and I have to make the most of it."],"Karisma Kapoor":["Okay, this is a secret, but I think that nursery rhymes are the most relaxing and fun songs.","I have learned so many things from my mother about the right upbringing, the right values, value for money, value for elders, for family members. I think these things only a parent can teach you.","I think I have just evolved as a person, as a human being. I like fitness. It's an important part of my everyday life, and I enjoy and endorse a healthy lifestyle.","My daughter is the most normal towards me. For her, I am just her mom. I am just a regular mom, and the actor comes after that. If she likes something that I am wearing, she tells me, and if she doesn't, she still makes it a point to let me know.","Maids in India have egos. Big egos. They do not like being spoken to curtly, and they do not like to be abruptly instructed by a woman they do not know. They come with the feeling that they already know everything. So while training them to do things your way, speak gently, and when they do it right, appreciate it.","I am doing what I love; acting is what I love best after being a mother.","Becoming a mother has been the best experience of my life, and I wouldn't trade it for anything.","I want to abolish tags like 'comeback' and 'retirement' that are used to define every married female actor. What is the big deal? In Hollywood, every top actor takes a break, has children, and gets back to work.","There are no plans that always work in life. For me, the secret to happiness is being positive and looking at the brighter side of my life.","India has progressed to a stage where a divorcee status hardly matters. What matters is that you raise a positive, independent, well-behaved and intelligent child.","I don't believe in the no-carb diet... I have a theory. I think if you give up carbs, you get cranky. You must include them in your daily diet.","Today what is more important for me is performance. At the risk of sounding immodest, I have done it all - 61 movies over 12 years. But now I am looking for quality. It's easy to be a star. Now I want to be an actress.","Acting is like driving; you can never forget it, and it's in my blood.","I won't say I am a strict mother, but discipline is important. Timing and routine are important for kids.","I think it is important to be a friend to your kids. But it is also equally important to set boundaries. My mother was a strong influence, and so was my dad. My mom was my friend whom I couldn't cross.","I try to shield my children as far as possible from the public glare. I want them to have a normal childhood like we had. We went to school by the school bus, had school food... There was no special treatment given to us. The same applies to my children as well.","It is my nature to strive to do my best. This does tend to take a toll on you.","Look at Gwyneth Paltrow and my favourite, Kate Winslet. No one ever says, 'Oh, she's making a comeback.' To my mind, I just went on maternity leave and reported back to work.","The Kapoor surname has legend, a passion for acting, respect and love attached to it. And I am very proud of that.","Just do what you believe in, and success will follow.","I love doing yoga and also enjoy going for regular walks.","You get funky things in Goa, so I like shopping there. Paris and Milan are also my preferred shopping destinations.","I like to dress up every day, so I think fashion is an everyday process.","If I want to, I can sign 20 films for ridiculous amounts of money, but I really want to do different kinds of cinema. I want creative satisfaction.","I am a total workaholic. If I don't shoot for two days, I get uncomfortable at home. I won't comment on my personal life. That is totally out of bounds. When I do get married, everyone will know.","There are hits and misses, and as an actress, we are mentally ready for all that.","I don't go by trends. I wear what I am comfortable in and what suits me. It is never about what is 'in' and what is 'out'. My personal sense of style spells 'comfort'.","I think a child requires initial years of a mother's attention, which is very important, and I did it without any thought in the world. That's what I wanted to do.","My son has taken liking for sports and is most of the time playing cricket and football. It is so much fun being with them, as I'm enjoying every phase of motherhood."],"Kariya Munda":["I am a common man. Why do I need security?","I grow the vegetables my family eats. I grow enough, and we seldom buy from the market.","Definitely, a non-tribal can become chief minister in Jharkhand."],"Karl A. Menninger":["One does not fall in love; one grows into love, and love grows in him.","The voice of the intelligence is drowned out by the roar of fear. It is ignored by the voice of desire. It is contradicted by the voice of shame. It is biased by hate and extinguished by anger. Most of all it is silenced by ignorance.","Love cures people - both the ones who give it and the ones who receive it.","Hope is a necessity for normal life and the major weapon against the suicide impulse.","Listening is a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force. The friends who listen to us are the ones we move toward. When we are listened to, it creates us, makes us unfold and expand.","Unrest of spirit is a mark of life.","We need criminals to identify ourselves with, to secretly envy and to stoutly punish. They do for us the forbidden, illegal things we wish to do.","What's done to children, they will do to society.","One of the most untruthful things possible, you know, is a collection of facts, because they can be made to appear so many different ways.","Is it hard for the reader to believe that suicides are sometimes committed to forestall the committing of murder? There is no doubt of it. Nor is there any doubt that murder is sometimes committed to avert suicide.","Police are not all bad guys. Nobody is all bad guys."],"Karl Abraham":["A considerable number of persons are able to protect themselves against the outbreak of serious neurotic phenomena only through intense work.","Even in my first analysis of a depressive psychosis, I was immediately struck by its structural similarity with obsessional neurosis.","The onset of mania occurs when repression is no longer able to resist the assaults of the repressed instincts.","A person who suffers from severe locomotor anxiety finds himself in an almost permanent state of mental tension. He wakes in the morning with the anxious expectation of having to go out somewhere in the course of the day.","Anyone who is interested in the psychology of children will have observed that whereas one child will resist temptation or seduction, another will easily yield to it. There are children who will hardly oppose any resistance to the invitation of an unknown person to follow him; others who react in an opposite way in the same circumstances.","Psychoanalytic investigation has shown that in mental patients excessive affection often turns to violent hostility.","Both dreams and neurotic dream-states have as their function the avoidance of displeasure, but the dream-states also serve to provide a positive pleasure gain.","When the depressive psychosis has become manifest, its cardinal feature seems to be a mental inhibition which renders a rapport between the patient and the external world more difficult.","Whereas the melancholic exhibits a state of general inhibition, in the manic patient even normal inhibitions of the instincts are partly or wholly abolished.","In neurotics, worm phobias are usually found as well as snake phobias.","Psychoanalysts have been occupied for a long time with the difficult question of what the psychological conditions are which determine the form of the neurotic disease to which the individual will succumb. It is as though he had a choice between different illnesses and led by unknown impulses selected one or other of them."],"Karl Amadeus Hartmann":["Unending was the stream, unending the misery, unending the sorrow.","We are known as one of the few truly antifascist families in Munich.","My friends, who sleep for all eternity; we do not forget you."],"Karl Barth":["Joy is the simplest form of gratitude.","Laughter is the closest thing to the grace of God.","In the Church of Jesus Christ there can and should be no non-theologians.","Faith in God's revelation has nothing to do with an ideology which glorifies the status quo.","Jews have God's promise and if we Christians have it, too, then it is only as those chosen with them, as guests in their house, that we are new wood grafted onto their tree.","Grace must find expression in life, otherwise it is not grace.","No one can be saved - in virtue of what he can do. Everyone can be saved - in virtue of what God can do.","It is always the case that when the Christian looks back, he is looking at the forgiveness of sins.","Men have never been good, they are not good and they never will be good.","Faith is never identical with piety.","Religion is the possibility of the removal of every ground of confidence except confidence in God alone.","Man can certainly flee from God... but he cannot escape him. He can certainly hate God and be hateful to God, but he cannot change into its opposite the eternal love of God which triumphs even in his hate.","What God chooses for us children of men is always the best.","Jesus does not give recipes that show the way to God as other teachers of religion do. He is himself the way.","It may be that when the angels go about their task praising God, they play only Bach. I am sure, however, that when they are together en famille they play Mozart.","Whether the angels play only Bach praising God, I am not quite sure. I am sure, however, that en famille they play Mozart.","Conscience is the perfect interpreter of life.","The best theology would need no advocates; it would prove itself."],"Karl Ferdinand Braun":["In the summer of 1902, I was able to erect two experimental stations on two forts at Strasbourg for the purpose of closer study.","Considering the greater amounts of energy which can be collected and stored in suitable experimental form in capacitors, one could expect to deliver radiated energy for some time from them.","Elementary considerations led me to the conclusion that a medium, composed of layers of different dielectric constants, must behave as a uniaxial crystal if it is assumed that the layer thicknesses are only a fraction of a wave-length."],"Karl G. Maeser":["Be yourself, but always your better self.","Not only will you be held accountable for the things you do, but you will be held responsible for the very thoughts you think.","Place me behind prison walls - walls of stone ever so high, ever so thick, reaching ever so far into the ground. There is a possibility that in some way or another I may be able to escape. But stand me on that floor and draw a chalk line around me and have me give my word of honor never to cross it. Can I get out of that circle? No. Never.","He who cheats others is a knave, but he who cheats himself is a fool.","Make the wise man within you your living ideal.","No man shall be more exacting of me or my conduct than I am of myself.","There is a Mount Sinai for every child of God if he only knows where to find it.","I would rather trust my child to a serpent than to a teacher who does not believe in God."],"Karl Iagnemma":["Partnerships remain critical to nuTonomy's success, and our aim is to work with groups with whom we share strategic aims and core values. These are partners that are transparent, innovative, and are focused on putting autonomous fleets on the road.","The fundamental problem here is that humans and automation approach the driving task differently.","For self-driving cars in particular, there are lots of dimensions of this technology beyond just impact on labour. There is a massive potential improvement in public health.","You put a car on the road which may be driving by the letter of the law, but compared to the surrounding road users, it's acting very conservatively. This can lead to situations where the autonomous car is a bit of a fish out of water.","Uniformity is the friend of scalability.","Surveys show that while many people are open to the idea of an autonomous vehicle driving them to work, far fewer are willing to let one drive their child to soccer practice.","Writing, for me at least, takes a lot of concentrated work and effort. It takes dedication and the willingness to do the work even when that feeling of inspiration isn't there at all.","I grew up in Michigan, in the Detroit area, so cars are sort of in my DNA.","Building cars is highly specialized, it's hard, and it's capital intensive.","Everything that's transported over ground, whether it's people or parcels, will be impacted by autonomous vehicle technology.","I usually have a general idea of where the story is going, but I try to avoid planning in too much detail. The best endings are those that emerge only after I've thought long and hard about the various ways the story might end. Then I choose the ending that seems surprising yet somehow inevitable.","I love driving through Western Massachusetts, out through the Berkshires, when the road is empty and it's a nice day. I don't like driving home on Memorial Drive at 5:45 or 6:45 at night when it's crowded and stressful. I think that's true of most people, and the goal of automated driving is to take the stressful part of driving out of the task.","It's maybe an unrecognized fact of academia that what you spend a lot of your time doing is convincing people of your vision and raising funds to support your research activity. So in that sense, transitioning to a startup wasn't that big of a transition.","It's funny how life works. You end up sometimes back where you started.","We hope to get to the place where there are thousands of Peugeot cars on the road running nuTonomy software.","Humans violate the rules in a safe and principled way, and the reality is that autonomous vehicles in the future may have to do the same thing if they don't want to be the source of bottlenecks.","When a driverless car looks out on the world, it's not able to distinguish the age of a pedestrian or the number of occupants in a car.","Even if we wanted to imbue an autonomous vehicle with an ethical engine, we don't have the technical capability today to do so.","All the technology going into self-driving cars is robotic technology. It's not automotive. That explains why some of the traditional automotive players didn't develop this technology.","Everybody likes driving through scenic, winding roads. It's hard to find people who like sitting in traffic in cities.","The AV ecosystem is constantly evolving, and no single winner will be crowned.","If you're a large organization, you may welcome a bit of regulation to keep the small guys out.","Singapore is likely to be the world's first market for self-driving cars. Commercial services around self-driving vehicles will likely be in Singapore before they are anywhere else in the world.","If you develop a technology that only works in a single city, where it's kind of optimized for a specific city, that's not really that exciting.","In Singapore, drivers generally obey the rules, but the attitude around pedestrians is actually quite different. It's culturally different. People drive safely, but it's not the same deference shown to pedestrians.","You have to force yourself to give up and to move onto something else. That's the way you grow as a writer, by trying new things and tackling new subjects. But it's difficult. There's part of you that doesn't want to give up because you realize that, in some way, you're surrendering.","When I first started writing, I didn't write about scientists at all. I think I wanted a break from that part of my world.","I'm really not interested in writing about science at all. I mean, I try to get the information right, the details right. But fiction isn't good at conveying information: It's good at telling stories about people in interesting situations.","To the extent that trolley problem scenarios exist in the real world, AVs will make them rarer, not more frequent.","Even if trolley problems were a realistic concern for AVs, it is not clear what, if anything, regulators or companies developing AVs should do about them. The trolley problem is an intensely debated thought experiment precisely because there isn't a consensus on what should be done.","Conflating thought experiments with reality could slow the deployment of AVs that are reliably safer than human drivers.","We are all vulnerable to the tendency to overestimate the likelihood of vivid, cognitively available risks rather than statistically likelier, but less salient, risks.","It's challenging to drive in a way that's human-like.","There's so much rich interaction with drivers that we take for granted. It seems like a mundane thing, but it turns out to be a really big deal.","From a technology and economic perspective, it's vastly more likely that autonomy will be used for mobility services.","It's a cultural question. Will people want to share cars?","Cities like New Delhi for example, where traffic is dense and it's a more fluid driving environment, that's hard for self-driving technology to deal with.","Singapore's not a very big country. They speak with one voice, and they have a clear idea of what their regulatory environment should look like.","We want to develop a technology that's globally applicable, that's not customized for a specific city or a specific country. The only way to do that is to be able to test every day in a diversity of environments.","It's important for automated cars to be able to drive in a human-like fashion - and that does mean adapting to the driving patterns around you.","From a societal aspect, when you are impatient behind a driverless car and there's no one to listen to your beeping horn, what are people going to do? How are they going to take out their aggression?","In the automotive domain, generally speaking, when you look at consortium models, the groups that have leading technology are less incentivized to contribute to the consortia.","When you contribute to an open-source or a shared solution, and there's a liability issue that arises from the use of that solution, how will this be tracked back to individual contributors?","My stories often begin with a situation or character rather than an insight about the human condition. It's always been difficult for me to write from an abstract idea, no matter how interesting or compelling I feel the idea might be.","The thing about stories is that they almost always find their way onto the page, even if it takes a while.","My parents encouraged me to be creative by being creative and interesting people themselves, and by making it clear how highly they valued creativity in others.","For better or worse, we have to bridge this divide between developing cars that drive by the book and cars that drive how you and I drive.","Our first iteration of driverless cars kind of drove like trolleys on a track. This uncanny notion threw people off.","There's a lot of knowledge in civil engineering about how soils will react when subjected to heavy loads. When you take lightweight vehicles and granular soils of varying composition, it's a very complex modeling process."],"Karl Jaspers":["The study of law left me unsatisfied, because I did not know the aspects of life which it serves. I perceived only the intricate mental juggling with fictions that did not interest me.","Philosophy can only be approached with the most concrete comprehension.","Philosophy as practice does not mean its restriction to utility or applicability, that is, to what serves morality or produces serenity of soul.","Philosophic meditation is an accomplishment by which I attain Being and my own self, not impartial thinking which studies a subject with indifference.","Only as an individual can man become a philosopher.","Even scientific knowledge, if there is anything to it, is not a random observation of random objects; for the critical objectivity of significant knowledge is attained as a practice only philosophically in inner action.","I began the study of medicine, impelled by a desire for knowledge of facts and of man. The resolution to do disciplined work tied me to both laboratory and clinic for a long time to come.","The more determinedly I exist, as myself, within the conditions of the time, the more clearly I shall hear the language of the past, the nearer I shall feel the glow of its life.","I discovered that the study of past philosophers is of little use unless our own reality enters into it. Our reality alone allows the thinker's questions to become comprehensible.","As a universal history of philosophy, the history of philosophy must become one great unity.","At the present moment, the security of coherent philosophy, which existed from Parmenides to Hegel, is lost.","Everything depends therefore on encountering thought at its source. Such thought is the reality of man's being, which achieved consciousness and understanding of itself through it.","If philosophy is practice, a demand to know the manner in which its history is to be studied is entailed: a theoretical attitude toward it becomes real only in the living appropriation of its contents from the texts.","My own being can be judged by the depths I reach in making these historical origins my own.","Only then, approaching my fortieth birthday, I made philosophy my life's work.","Philosophy is tested and characterised by the way in which it appropriates its history.","Reason is like an open secret that can become known to anyone at any time; it is the quiet space into which everyone can enter through his own thought.","The community of masses of human beings has produced an order of life in regulated channels which connects individuals in a technically functioning organisation, but not inwardly from the historicity of their souls.","The great philosophers and the great works are standards for the selection of what is essential. Everything that we do in studying the history of philosophy ultimately serves their better understanding.","The history of philosophy is not, like the history of the sciences, to be studied with the intellect alone. That which is receptive in us and that which impinges upon us from history is the reality of man's being, unfolding itself in thought.","To decide to become a philosopher seemed as foolish to me as to decide to become a poet."],"Karl Kraus":["Corruption is worse than prostitution. The latter might endanger the morals of an individual, the former invariably endangers the morals of the entire country.","Jealousy is a dog's bark which attracts thieves.","There are people who can never forgive a beggar for their not having given him anything.","Sex education is legitimate in that girls cannot be taught soon enough how children don't come into the world.","Education is a crutch with which the foolish attack the wise to prove that they are not idiots.","Stupidity is an elemental force for which no earthquake is a match.","A writer is someone who can make a riddle out of an answer.","The closer the look one takes at a word, the greater distance from which it looks back.","The trouble with Germans is not that they fire shells, but that they engrave them with quotations from Kant.","Curses on the law! Most of my fellow citizens are the sorry consequences of uncommitted abortions.","I and my public understand each other very well: it does not hear what I say, and I don't say what it wants to hear.","Psychoanalysis is that mental illness for which it regards itself as therapy.","Journalist: a person without any ideas but with an ability to express them; a writer whose skill is improved by a deadline: the more time he has, the worse he writes.","Matrimony is the union of meanness and martyrdom.","Morality is a venereal disease. Its primary stage is called virtue; its secondary stage, boredom; its tertiary stage, syphilis.","Virginity is the ideal of those who want to deflower.","Education is what most receive, many pass on, and few possess.","How is the world ruled and led to war? Diplomats lie to journalists and believe these lies when they see them in print.","Children play soldier. That makes sense. But why do soldiers play children?","The sound principle of a topsy-turvy lifestyle in the framework of an upside-down world order has stood every test.","You'd be surprised how hard it can often be to translate an action into an idea.","When a man is treated like a beast, he says, 'After all, I'm human.' When he behaves like a beast, he says 'After all, I'm only human.'","It is better not to express what one means than to express what one does not mean.","I don't like to meddle in my private affairs.","Science is spectral analysis. Art is light synthesis.","To me all men are equal: there are jackasses everywhere, and I have the same contempt for them all.","He who does without the praise of the crowd will not deny himself an opportunity to be his own adherent.","Experiences are savings which a miser puts aside. Wisdom is an inheritance which a wastrel cannot exhaust.","My unconscious knows more about the consciousness of the psychologist than his consciousness knows about my unconscious.","A child learns to discard his ideals, whereas a grown-up never wears out his short pants.","Democracy divides people into workers and loafers. It makes no provision for those who have no time to work.","If the reporter has killed our imagination with his truth, he threatens our life with his lies.","Squeeze human nature into the straitjacket of criminal justice and crime will appear.","Culture is the tacit agreement to let the means of subsistence disappear behind the purpose of existence. Civilization is the subordination of the latter to the former.","Democracy means the opportunity to be everyone's slave.","It is the style of idealism to console itself for the loss of something old with the ability to gape at something new.","Language is the mother of thought, not its handmaiden.","Do not learn more than you absolutely need to get through life.","A woman who cannot be ugly is not beautiful.","Feminine passion is to masculine as an epic is to an epigram.","Solitude would be ideal if you could pick the people to avoid.","No ideas and the ability to express them - that's a journalist.","Someone who can write aphorisms should not fritter away his time in essays.","Christian morality prefers remorse to precede lust, and then lust not to follow.","The mission of the press is to spread culture while destroying the attention span.","I am already so popular that anyone who vilifies me becomes more popular than I am.","Sexuality poorly repressed unsettles some families; well repressed, it unsettles the whole world.","I had a terrible vision: I saw an encyclopedia walk up to a polymath and open him up.","I and life: The case was settled chivalrously. The opponents parted without having made up.","There is no more unfortunate creature under the sun than a fetishist who yearns for a woman's shoe and has to settle for the whole woman.","An idea's birth is legitimate if one has the feeling that one is catching oneself plagiarizing oneself.","Scandal begins when the police put a stop to it.","Journalists write because they have nothing to say, and have something to say because they write.","A fine world in which man reproaches woman with fulfilling his heart's desire!"],"Karl Lagerfeld":["Black-and-white always looks modern, whatever that word means.","I believe in sketching because there is something very sensitive in sketching, you know, in sketches that you don't have out of a computer that looks the same like everybody even if, later on, the dresses are OK, but I like to sketch, and I like to see trails made after my sketches that look the same. It is you know, what I like.","I never look at my watch when I'm sketching!","No, I never thought I would like cats.","Beauty is also submitted to the taste of time, so a beautiful woman from the Belle Epoch is not exactly the perfect beauty of today, so beauty is something that changes with time.","The first thing I do when I get up, I have breakfast.","I'm born with a pencil in my hand. I did lots of sketching.","I wanted to become a cartoon artist, a portrait artist, and an illustrator. This was my first idea.","My job is to bring out in people what they wouldn't dare do themselves.","I never played with anything like toys.","Oh yes, I love to do shoes. I'm not a fetishist but I love to do shoes.","When I was a child I asked my mother what homosexuality was about and she said - and this was 100 years ago in Germany and she was very open-minded - 'It's like hair color. It's nothing. Some people are blond and some people have dark hair. It's not a subject.' This was a very healthy attitude.","There will be gay couples; it will exist. It is not very nice that people who are married - who divorce in three seconds - don't want protection for the others. The legal system should protect everyone, not just the few people who think they are above everybody else because they are married.","I don't know what 'normal' means, anyway.","I am not a second option person. It is that or nothing. If it is not the way I see it I prefer not to see it.","I never drink anything hot; I don't like hot drinks, very strange.","In a meat-eating world, wearing leather for shoes and clothes and even handbags, the discussion of fur is childish.","Music is part of the life of fashion, too.","The importance of logo into today's fashion is un! be! Lievable!","What I enjoy most is doing something I've never done before.","What I hate is nasty, ugly people.","Nothing scares me more than people with some doll collection.","I don't care if people I admire criticize me because their opinion is valuable to me.","Doing collections, doing fashion is like a non-stop dialogue.","I think tattoos are horrible. It's like living in a Pucci dress full-time.","Don't overact the story of your name. Overact the story of your work.","I don't take showers at night, because I take a bath when I wake up. Then I go to bed on the most beautiful Egyptian-cotton antique sheets in the world.","No one wants to see curvy women.","Bling is over. Red carpet covered with rhinestones is out. I call it 'the new modesty.'","I never smoked. I never drank and I never took drugs. The funny thing is, nothing is more boring, people like this. For me, it's OK. But most of my friends, at least they smoke and drink.","It's only I have seen enough of it and the funny thing is now, I know that I'm skinny, because I know there are even smaller clothes in the store. I think I'm big, when I was big, I never thought about it.","What I love best in life is new starts.","I drink Diet Coke from the minute I get up to the minute I go to bed.","I love dogs, but dogs, you have to be in the country with dogs. I cannot walk a dog on the street.","A collection is not just one basic idea. It comes from something that is in the air, something you suddenly like and put down on paper and then work out.","I hate the past - especially my own past.","You have to like the present; if not your life becomes secondhand, if you think it was better before. Or that it will be better in the future.","I do my job like I breathe.","I never fall in love.","I am like a TV antenna. I catch everything that is in the air, and then I do it my way.","I would like to be a one-man multinational fashion phenomenon.","Mostly I stay at home from the morning until 5 P.M., and I only go out for fittings and shoots because I work at home. I like to be alone.","I could speak three languages when I was six, and when I went to school, I only liked to read and sketch. At five, I could write and everything.","I'm a working-class person, working with class.","I can tell you all kinds of moral tales, but fashion and reality are vaguely different.","I eat fish, three times a week meat, and if not yogurt, something like this and it rarely continues.","If there's something dangerous, sauces are dangerous for the body.","The iPod completely changed the way people approach music.","Stupidly it should not be. It should be also nice. One must get along with that. Is however not necessary.","But if I have a lot of imagination, I could tell myself whatever I wanted, you know. I handle myself quite well. I'm kind of fascist with myself, you know. There's no discussion. There is an order. You follow it.","I had nearly finished school because I was making effort not that bad on that. But there was a law in Germany after the war. You could not make your final examination before 18, so lots of people who were late because of the way had to do it first.","I have now exactly the same weight I had when I was 18, 20.","I like today and perhaps a little future still, but the past is really something I'm not interested in. So, as far as I'm concerned, I like only the past of things and people I don't know. When I know, I don't care because I knew how it was.","I never - you know also one of the things that would save me for a man my age, it was not that easy to lose that much weight and fall down and look like something draped.","I never had to learn English, French and German because I was brought up as all three languages. I had a private French teacher before I even went to school. That helped a lot.","I'm not a marketing person. I don't ask myself questions. I go by instinct.","My favorite kitchen was the Japanese and the Italian kitchen.","No, and I never, ever eat in between the meals. I control it well enough and with no pills, and I sleep seven hours a night. I go to bed. I fall asleep, and I wake up seven hours later, and this is the most important.","No, I'm not a French designer either. I'm from nowhere. I'm a European, old European is all I am.","No. I mean those people really did something for designers I don't think department stores can, could or should do still today. Today the world is different so you have to make it differently. There's TV. There's a lot of things.","Some people would like me to be round again.","Yes, and I can sit down on a white piece of paper and work because I don't believe too much into inspiration, only I'm waiting for inspiration, work and then inspiration may come. It's a little too easy to say that.","Yes, some people say to me you're too skinny, but never a skinny person says that to me, only people who could lose a few pounds say that.","I prefer to be in a video than to play with it.","Bears are very nice, as long as you are nice to them.","I can hardly eat meat because it has to look like something what it was not when it was alive.","In France there are, I think, less than one per cent of people who are too skinny.","Personally, I don't wear fur.","I'm totally myself.","People like me were supposed to be into exclusivity, unapproachable. That's what I hate most. I think it's very demode.","T-shirts for ten dollars are even more fashion today than expensive fashion.","I don't want to look sloppy, because then I feel sloppy.","Don't dress to kill, dress to survive.","I like the discipline of well-cut, impeccable clothes. I think it's a very healthy discipline.","Who buys French cars? Not me.","Foreigners don't want to invest any more in France - and this is not working.","I don't speak Spanish, I speak a little of Italian but no Spanish.","There are so many people in the world who cannot read English or French or whatever.","I can do whatever I want.","I never go anywhere. I do sketches and make phone calls, and people visit. It's more fun to come to Paris.","I wanted to become an illustrator as a child.","I sleep seven hours. If I go to bed at two, I wake up at nine. If I go to bed at midnight, I wake up at seven.

It's an inspiring extension for my mind.","I always loved advertising. If I hadn't been in fashion, I'd have been in advertising.","People can drink with their eyes; I can eat with my nose.","The brain is a muscle, and I'm a kind of body-builder.","I'm kind of fascist with myself, you know.","I think for my bones and my size, I better stay with my 60 kilo.","Buy clothes the size you want to wear.","I have my permanent muses and my muses of the moment.","I'm not a fortune-teller.","Clothes if they are not well cut, you can kill nobody. A building poorly built can kill people. It's a much more difficult work. I would not compare myself with that.","I'm an iPod person.","I like to do things quickly because I'm easily bored.","I'm not an employee who goes to the office every morning at the same time. Then, vacations are needed.","I'm like a rock singer with one-night stands on the road.","I don't do meetings.","I love to watch times change!","I am never satisfied with myself and that is what keeps me going - I have no post-satisfaction.","There are less than 1 per cent of anorexic girls, but there more than 30 per cent of girls in France - I don't know about England - that are much, much overweight. And it is much more dangerous and very bad for the health.","The story with anorexic girls - nobody works with anorexic girls. That has nothing to do with fashion.","Why should I stop working? If I do, I'll die and it'll all be finished.","There's something boring about people who have to go to an office for a living.","I'm lucky to work in the most perfect of conditions.","Work is making a living out of being bored.","I eat next to nothing.","I can no longer walk in the street. That's over.","I'm German in my mind, but from a Germany that doesn't exist any more.","I don't want to be on the Internet.","I have no human feelings.","I think it's horrible that people have to be told. Don't smoke! Everybody knows it's bad for the health. But they have to forbid it.","Greece needs to work on a cleaner image. It's a big problem, as they have this reputation of being so corrupt.","I have moved to a smaller house in Paris, and I don't fancy having so much staff now.","Fortunately there is more wealth in the world than there was at the time of the global economic crisis of 1929 - Chinese, Indian, Arab and Russian.","Vanity is the healthiest thing in life.","It would have been difficult to have an ugly daughter.","If I were a woman, I would love to have lots of kids. But for men, I don't believe in it.","For me, New York is comfortable, not strange.","I have more friends in New York than Paris.","I make such big efforts to forget things and I can't tell the story of my life because, thank God, I'm still living it.","I didn't play with other children.","I hardly went to school.","My childhood was endless - from eight to 18 felt like hundreds of years.","The way I talk is bizarre.","My mother did not like children.","You cannot be creative with people around you.","Everything I say is a joke. I am a joke myself.","My hair is not really white; it's kind of grayish, and I don't like the color. So I make it totally white with Klorane dry shampoo. That is the best thing to do because my hair is always clean.","I hated to be treated as a child. I thought it was the worst situation.","I've only wanted paper and beautiful colors. It was my dream, and it still is my dream. And books. They're all I need, and the rest I can do without.","I'm all self-taught. I never had a teacher. Even for English, and French, and German, I hardly went to school.","Pfft, I hate Christmas Day. It's for children and families. Not for people like me.","I'm always relaxed.","I don't have any stress. I'm very lucky. I live a very healthy life.","I don't eat bubble gum, but I like the smell.","There was a moment when designers draped in ermine would be reading Proust, or pretending to.","I like the language in Proust but not the context.","One day it will be over, and I don't care.","I spent my childhood in the country and started reading even before going to school. There was nothing else in my life but sketching and reading.","I'm not very gifted for hairdos. I don't like gel and all those products.","I worked out a lot before I was 20. I was hard underneath. I had just a little padding. I was quilted. Always Chanel.","Start your diet during a period of optimism and happiness.","I'm a total puritan, but I found Jacques' adventures amusing. We couldn't be further apart. I am a Calvinist toward myself and totally indulgent toward others.","Is there a way to design a room in my house where I float around? I would quite enjoy that. It's nuts.","Paris by night is a nightmare now. It is not a cliche anymore.","Everything has changed, and nothing has changed more than the world of fashion.","If you're in this business and you are scared, then you better do something else.","I don't look at my old work. I mean, they made nice books; the books were made without me, the one from last year and the one from this year. I - personally, I'm not interested in my own past. I'm only interested in today - perhaps tomorrow.","I was always told as a child by my mother that you always have to be impeccable, even when you go to bed.","In my day, there were no vet video games.","100 percent a huge fan of Beyonce. If I see her, I will faint. I've met her before. I just get really nervous and quiet - I just shut up and bow down.","Everyone wants to know and hopes I retire so they can get the jobs. But my contracts with Fendi and Chanel are lifelong.","I admire people who destroy themselves."],"Karl Landsteiner":["It is very kind of you to consider the possibility of my working in Pasadena, an idea which certainly is attractive, especially since it would hold out the prospect of your cooperation or advice.","Owing to the difficulty of dealing with substances of high molecular weight we are still a long way from having determined the chemical characteristics and the constitution of proteins, which are regarded as the principal con-stituents of living organisms."],"Karl Lehmann":["But when one identifies the Church with a cultural and political bloc, there is the danger of making difficult the Church's contact with all those outside the bloc.","Christians who have influence in political life must feel as individuals responsibility in front of their own faith. And the duty of encouraging laws that are not in contradiction with the Commandments comes within the mission of the Church.","Common participation in the Eucharist can only be a final outcome of ecumenic dialogue, not the starting point.","For the future, I would suggest avoiding subjects of too vast a scale. It would be useful to make out a list of fundamental questions on the matter to be dealt with, and discuss only those.","I believe that Orthodoxy has been thinking lately, and despite other impressions, that we can't have full sacramental communion if we don't first have a fundamental agreement on the question of the primacy, that still isn't there.","The interest in the supernatural in a very generic sense and in the spiritual is not in itself a factor that helps the communication of the Christian faith.","The mission proper to the Church is that of proclaiming the Gospel.","The Synod of Bishops has existed for forty years. In that long span of time it has been for all of us a good school for introducing us to the universal dimension of the Church.","There's always the tendency to transform the Church into an ethical agency, and of measuring the Church by the yardstick of social and cultural utility."],"Karl Liebknecht":["Like a cyclone, imperialism spins across the globe; militarism crushes peoples and sucks their blood like a vampire.","For capitalism, war and peace are business and nothing but business.","Long live the liberation of the workers off all countries from the infernal chasm of war, exploitation and slavery!","To the socialist no nation is free whose national existence is based upon the enslavement of another people, for to him colonial peoples, too, are peoples, and, as such, parts of the national state.","The Russian revolution was to an unprecedented degree the cause of the proletariat of the whole world becoming more revolutionary.","Imperialism is not the creation of any one or any one group of states.","In the present imperialistic milieu there can be no wars of national self-defense.","The aim of my life is the overthrow of monarchy.","International socialism recognizes the right of free independent nations, with equal rights.","This republic represents the greatest basis for that universal socialist order, the creation of which is at the present time the historic task of the International Proletariat.","But Socialism, alone, can bring self-determination of their peoples.","Capitalism is war; socialism is peace.","Class struggle: external peace, international solidarity, peace among peoples. This is the sacred slogan of international socialist democracy that liberates nations.","Consider well this fact: As long as the German people does not arise and use force directed by its own will, the assassination of the people will continue.","In capitalist history, invasion and class struggle are not opposites, as the official legend would have us believe, but one is the means and the expression of the other.","Incendiary capitalism is carrying its out evil works more dangerously than ever, and is doing so in the increasingly dangerous neighborhood of the powder kegs that are the great European military powers.","Just as invasion is the true and tried weapon in the hands of capital against the class struggle, so on the other hand the fearless pursuit of the class struggle has always proven the most effective preventative of foreign invasions.","Passive fatalism can never be the role of a revolutionary party, like the Social Democracy.","The failure of the Russian Socialist Republic will be the defeat of the proletariat of the whole world.","The new Germany has the unquestionable right to hold its tongue between its teeth.","Through this experience we have been warned - learn everything, don't forget anything!","Workers, comrades, and you, women of the people, let not this festival of May, the second during the war, pass without protest against the Imperialist Slaughter.","Yes, Socialists should defend their country in great historical crises.","The basic law of capitalism is you or I, not both you and I."],"Karl Malden":["I'm a workaholic.

I say to the young people, 'If you have a dream, chase it.'","Misery loves company. This is a Hollywood soap opera, and I'm not going to be a star in another Bryant soap opera.","I don't know what my label is. I just think of myself as a plain forward. I like to think I have some finesse to my game, but inside the paint is where men are made. If you can't play there, you should be home with your mama.","Somebody tell the damn players to start playing like old school.","Marijuana is not tested for, and yet that is the big thing guys are getting in trouble with in the league. It's terrible.","I have many friends and family members who have served (or are currently serving) in our nation's Armed Forces. I have such a profound respect for what they do day in and day out.","They changed the floor back to old school. They changed the uniform back to old school. Somebody tell the damn players to start playing like old school.","It takes people a while to trust you.","I realize that things happen for a reason.","You take the good with the bad and try not to listen to everything said about you because you know it's not good.","I just work out hard enough that, if I'm craving something, I eat it and know I'm going to burn it off the next day with extra intensity.","I just think we want to stay healthy, and I don't think we think about a sense of urgency.

But be respectful, go out there and enjoy the game.","If I could have come in for $10m, I would have done that. I've been pretty smart with my money. I'm playing because I want to play this game here - I want the opportunity.","I have my life on a track that I want it on, and I don't want to get off.","I hope I did it the way my peers did it before me. I didn't do anything but try to play hard.","Even though I left for a year, I grew here as a Jazz man. If I'm fortunate enough to go into the Hall of Fame, I will go as a Jazz man.","You're a professional. You don't need for me to break a film down for you. If you want to stop the guy you're playing, they pay you millions of dollars. You get you a TV and break the player down yourself.","I can do something physically the other guy can't. I know the other guy has not dedicated himself the way I did.","When I said I retired from basketball playing, I have retired. You will not see me play again. That is a promise.","At some point in time I will be honored if I would be mentioned as a coach.","I just want to make a name for myself and get to the next level.","I never felt I had the kind of relationship with Magic that I could just pick up the phone and call him at home.","All records are not made to be broken.","You work for whatever you get in life.","I have to be working, doing things. That's the way I grew up and the way I was taught.","To catch the ball, face up, look at all of my options and then pass. I was playing hot potato.

Hit the guy across from you. Don't let somebody come in your space.","But I think anybody who believes I could force coach Sloan to resign is crazy. He's stronger than that and personally if I said that to him, he'd probably go tell me to go do something.","Look at this, scabs and cuts all over me, I get these every night, every game. They can't tell you that you're not at risk, and you can't tell me there's one guy in the N.B.A. who hasn't thought about it.","You have injuries that bother you when you're not playing. When that horn blows, you don't feel it.","Did you really think I would sell you out?","I have such a profound respect for what they do day in and day out. This USO tour is especially meaningful because of the friends I have met and I am honored to be apart of it.","For me to be here tonight, everything had to be perfect. I had to get drafted by Utah, had to play with a point guard like John Stockton, and had to be coached by Jerry Sloan and Frank Layden."],"Karl Marlantes":["'Matterhorn' is my metaphor of the Vietnam War - we built it, we abandoned it, we assaulted it, we lost, and then we abandoned it again.","When I first got back from the war, I said, 'I'm gonna write the Great American Novel about the Vietnam War.' So I sat down and wrote 1,700 pages of sheer psychotherapy drivel. It was first person, and there would be pages about wet socks and cold feet.","We all want to be special, to stand out; there's nothing wrong with this. The irony is that every human being is special to start with, because we're unique to start with. But we then go through some sort of boot camp from the age of zero to about 18 where we learn everything we can about how not to be unique.","I mean, if you're proud of what you've done when you've served in the military, well then we call that bragging. And if you are unhappy about what happened, we call that complaining. And so what are you going to do?","The Marine Corps taught me how to kill, but it didn't teach me how to deal with killing.","I knew many Marines had done brave deeds that no one saw and for which they got no medals at all. I was having a very hard time carrying those medals and didn't have the insight or maturity to know what to do with my combination of guilt and pride.","When the peace treaty is signed, the war isn't over for the veterans, or the family. It's just starting.","War is society's dirty work, usually done by kids cleaning up failures perpetrated by adults.","In the military I could exercise the power of being automatically respected because of the medals on my chest, not because I had done anything right at the moment to earn that respect. This is pretty nice. It's also a psychological trap that can stop one's growth and allow one to get away with just plain bad behavior.","I mean... if you're raised as a decent human being, killing somebody is against every moral thing you've ever been taught. And so, generally, in combat it's 'krauts,' the 'gooks,' the 'yanks' - whatever you want to do to try and make it so that it's not a human being.","And I think that it's - the military has actually made improvements, so people are considering post-traumatic stress disorder as, at the least, a possible psychological problem. You know, when I was in Vietnam, it was just considered malingering. And we're making progress.","I grew up in Oregon, where as a teenager I worked with my grandfather Axel on his i shing boat at the mouth of the Columbia River.","I don't want any romantics to go into the military. I'm not a pacifist. I think we need a military, and the better one we have, the better off we are. I don't want kids going in there thinking that it's John Wayne on Iwo Jima. That's not healthy.","For every veteran who goes through a divorce, a wife goes through one, too. For every veteran alone in the basement, there is a wife upstairs, bewildered, isolated and in despair from the dark clouds of war that hangs over family life.","Really important books to me are the classics. I try very hard to read them well - you know, especially once I got serious about writing. So, reading Tolstoy several times - 'War and Peace,' 'The Kreutzer Sonata' - all those were really important to me.","'The Odyssey' is the great tale, and I was really taken by 'The Iliad,' so I dig into those things, and when I was a kid I didn't. You've gotta have a certain level of understanding yourself before that stuff really starts to resonate.","I began writing 'Matterhorn' in 1975 and for more than 30 years I kept working on my novel in my spare time, unable to get an agent or publisher to even read the manuscript.","I was given the ability to create stories and characters. That's my part of the long chain of writers, publishers, agents, booksellers, librarians, and a host of others who eventually deliver literature to the world. I want to do for others what Eudora Welty did for me.","Vietnam was the first time that Americans of different races had to depend on each other. In the Second World War, they were segregated; it was in Vietnam that American integration happened in the military - and it wasn't easy."],"Karl Marx":["History repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce.","Let the ruling classes tremble at a communist revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. Workingmen of all countries, unite!","The production of too many useful things results in too many useless people.","Social progress can be measured by the social position of the female sex.","Democracy is the road to socialism.","The only antidote to mental suffering is physical pain.","The history of all previous societies has been the history of class struggles.","The theory of Communism may be summed up in one sentence: Abolish all private property.","Reason has always existed, but not always in a reasonable form.","The rich will do anything for the poor but get off their backs.","From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs.","Workers of the world unite; you have nothing to lose but your chains.","Religion is the opium of the masses.","Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.","The meaning of peace is the absence of opposition to socialism.","Capitalist production, therefore, develops technology, and the combining together of various processes into a social whole, only by sapping the original sources of all wealth - the soil and the labourer.","Revolutions are the locomotives of history.","Medicine heals doubts as well as diseases.","The writer must earn money in order to be able to live and to write, but he must by no means live and write for the purpose of making money.","Anyone who knows anything of history knows that great social changes are impossible without feminine upheaval. Social progress can be measured exactly by the social position of the fair sex, the ugly ones included.","If anything is certain, it is that I myself am not a Marxist.","Capital is dead labor, which, vampire-like, lives only by sucking living labor, and lives the more, the more labor it sucks.","The human being is in the most literal sense a political animal, not merely a gregarious animal, but an animal which can individuate itself only in the midst of society.","The first requisite for the happiness of the people is the abolition of religion.","In bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality, while the living person is dependent and has no individuality.","Necessity is blind until it becomes conscious. Freedom is the consciousness of necessity.","Men's ideas are the most direct emanations of their material state.","Capital is money, capital is commodities. By virtue of it being value, it has acquired the occult ability to add value to itself. It brings forth living offspring, or, at the least, lays golden eggs.","The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e., the class which is the ruling material force of society, is at the same time its ruling intellectual force.","The worker of the world has nothing to lose, but their chains, workers of the world unite.","Society does not consist of individuals but expresses the sum of interrelations, the relations within which these individuals stand.","We should not say that one man's hour is worth another man's hour, but rather that one man during an hour is worth just as much as another man during an hour. Time is everything, man is nothing: he is at the most time's carcass.","Landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed.","A commodity appears at first sight an extremely obvious, trivial thing. But its analysis brings out that it is a very strange thing, abounding in metaphysical subtleties and theological niceties.","Nothing can have value without being an object of utility.","The ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class.","Religion is the impotence of the human mind to deal with occurrences it cannot understand.","The development of civilization and industry in general has always shown itself so active in the destruction of forests that everything that has been done for their conservation and production is completely insignificant in comparison.","Capital is reckless of the health or length of life of the laborer, unless under compulsion from society.","Art is always and everywhere the secret confession, and at the same time the immortal movement of its time.","For the bureaucrat, the world is a mere object to be manipulated by him.","The country that is more developed industrially only shows, to the less developed, the image of its own future.","Machines were, it may be said, the weapon employed by the capitalists to quell the revolt of specialized labor.","Greek philosophy seems to have met with something with which a good tragedy is not supposed to meet, namely, a dull ending.","In a higher phase of communist society... only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be fully left behind and society inscribe on its banners: from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.","The more the division of labor and the application of machinery extend, the more does competition extend among the workers, the more do their wages shrink together.","History does nothing; it does not possess immense riches, it does not fight battles. It is men, real, living, who do all this.","Experience praises the most happy the one who made the most people happy.","A specter is haunting Europe - the specter of communism.","It is absolutely impossible to transcend the laws of nature. What can change in historically different circumstances is only the form in which these laws expose themselves.","Natural science will in time incorporate into itself the science of man, just as the science of man will incorporate into itself natural science: there will be one science.","It is not history which uses men as a means of achieving - as if it were an individual person - its own ends. History is nothing but the activity of men in pursuit of their ends.","Without doubt, machinery has greatly increased the number of well-to-do idlers.","While the miser is merely a capitalist gone mad, the capitalist is a rational miser.","On a level plain, simple mounds look like hills; and the insipid flatness of our present bourgeoisie is to be measured by the altitude of its great intellects.","There is a specter haunting Europe, the specter of Communism.","The writer may very well serve a movement of history as its mouthpiece, but he cannot of course create it.","The English have all the material requisites for the revolution. What they lack is the spirit of generalization and revolutionary ardour.","The product of mental labor - science - always stands far below its value, because the labor-time necessary to reproduce it has no relation at all to the labor-time required for its original production."],"Karl Ove Knausgaard":["When I look back at that freedom of childhood, which is in a way infinite, and at all the joy and the intense happiness, now lost, I sometimes think that childhood is where the real meaning of life is located, and that we, adults, are its servants - that that's our purpose.","You can write a radical Norwegian or a conservative Norwegian. And when I changed to a conservative Norwegian, I gained this distance or objectivity in the language. The gap released something in me, and in the writing, which made it possible for the protagonist to think thoughts I had never myself thought.","My memory is basically visual: that's what I remember, rooms and landscapes. What I do not remember are what the people in these room were telling me. I never see letters or sentences when I write or read, but only the images they produce.","The eye of God ends up inside, so that, in the end, you take care of judgment and punishment yourself.","I have this habit to bow my head, as to look shorter, maybe as a result of an unconscious demand of not taking up so much space.","The difficult thing for me is that I want basically to be a good man. That's what I want to be.","Life develops, changes, is in motion. The forms of literature are not.","It's one thing to be banal, stupid, and idiotic on the inside. It's another to have it captured in writing.","As a person, I'm polite - I want to please.","Is literature more important than hurting people? You can't argue that. You can't say it. It's impossible.","When it comes to memories of that iconic type, memories that are burned into you, I have maybe ten or so from my childhood. I'm a bad rememberer of situations. I forget almost everything as soon as it happens.","I guess I have a talent for humiliation, a place within me that experience can't reach, which is terrible in real life but something that comes in handy in writing. It seems as though humiliation has become a career for me.","Concealing what is shameful to you will never lead to anything of value.","My writing became more and more minimalist. In the end, I couldn't write at all. For seven or eight years, I hardly wrote. But then I had a revelation. What if I did the opposite? What if, when a sentence or a scene was bad, I expanded it, and poured in more and more? After I started to do that, I became free in my writing.","My intention throughout has been to write, to create literature, and to be able to look people in the eye after I'd done it - the people I'd written about.","Form is, in a way, death. A novelist's obligation is to break free from the form, even though he knows that this will also be seen as artificial and distanced from life.","I'm giving away my family's story. Who owns the family's story? I don't. But you could turn it around and ask, 'Who is to deny me to write my family's story?' I have hurt people, but I don't think in a dangerous way. But you can't tell.","I am happy because I am no longer an author.","I have a longing for fiction, to try to believe in it and to disappear into it.","I do feel guilty. I do. Especially about my family, my children. I write about them, and I know that this will haunt them as well through their lives. Why did I do that to them?"],"Karl Ove Knausgard":["As a person, I'm polite - I want to please.","I have a longing for fiction - to try to believe in it and to disappear into it.","Saying what you believe others want to hear is, of course, a form of lying."],"Karl Pearson":["The mathematician, carried along on his flood of symbols, dealing apparently with purely formal truths, may still reach results of endless importance for our description of the physical universe.","Statistics is the grammar of science."],"Karl Philipp Moritz":["My landlady, who is only a tailor's widow, reads her Milton; and tells me, that her late husband first fell in love with her on this very account: because she read Milton with such proper emphasis.","On a very gloomy dismal day, just such a one as it ought to be, I went to see Westminster Abbey.","All over London as one walks, one everywhere, in the season, sees oranges to sell; and they are in general sold tolerably cheap, one and even sometimes two for a halfpenny; or, in our money, threepence.","As I passed along the side walls of Westminster Abbey, I hardly saw any thing but marble monuments of great admirals, but which were all too much loaded with finery and ornaments, to make on me at least, the intended impression.","St. Paul's arose like some huge mountain above the enormous mass of smaller buildings.","Westminster Abbey, the Tower, a steeple, one church, and then another, presented themselves to our view; and we could now plainly distinguish the high round chimneys on the tops of the houses, which yet seemed to us to form an innumerable number of smaller spires, or steeples.","In the streets through which we passed, I must own the houses in general struck me as if they were dark and gloomy, and yet at the same time they also struck me as prodigiously great and majestic.","These funerals always appear to me the more indecent in a populous city, from the total indifference of the beholders, and the perfect unconcern with which they are beheld.","I had almost forgotten to tell you that I have already been to the Parliament House; and yet this is of most importance. For, had I seen nothing else in England but this, I should have thought my journey thither amply rewarded.","Whilst in Prussia poets only speak of the love of country as one of the dearest of all human affections, here there is no man who does not feel, and describe with rapture, how much he loves his country.","You see in the streets of London, great and little boys running about in long blue coats, which, like robes, reach quite down to the feet, and little white bands, such as the clergy wear.","It is a common observation, that the more solicitous any people are about dress, the more effeminate they are.","Every view, and every object I studied attentively, by viewing them again and again on every side, for I was anxious to make a lasting impression of it on my imagination.","The church of St. Peter at Berlin, notwithstanding the total difference between them in the style of building, appears in some respects to have a great resemblance to St. Paul's in London.","In London, before I set out, I had paid one shilling; another was now demanded, so that upon the whole, from London to Richmond, the passage in the stage costs just two shillings.","I now resolved to go to bed early, with a firm purpose of also rising early the next day to revisit this charming walk; for I thought to myself, I have now seen this temple of the modern world imperfectly; I have seen it only by moonlight.","A traveller on foot in this country seems to be considered as a sort of wild man or out-of-the way being, who is stared at, pitied, suspected, and shunned by everybody that meets him.","My host at Richmond, yesterday morning, could not sufficiently express his surprise that I intended to venture to walk as far as Oxford, and still farther. He however was so kind as to send his son, a clever little boy, to show me the road leading to Windsor.","The short English miles are delightful for walking. You are always pleased to find, every now and then, in how short a time you have walked a mile, though, no doubt, a mile is everywhere a mile, I walk but a moderate pace, and can accomplish four English miles in an hour.","I am very sorry to say that I rejoiced when I once more perceived the towers of Windsor behind me.","The joining of the whole congregation in prayer has something exceedingly solemn and affecting in it."],"Karl Pilkington":["I'd rather live in a cave with a view of a palace than live in a palace with a view of a cave.","I'm not that lazy, but I don't need that much money.

Now, I don't know if that's true, if that's some bee enthusiast who managed to write a good document, and people believe this.","Being honest with you, it's not the 'great' wall of China. It's an all right wall. It's the 'All Right Wall of China.'","For me, a good holiday is about value for money rather than things to see.","That's the problem with having a bald head. It exaggerates the shape.","I've never understood the 'things to do before you die' idea. If I was ill, I'd be in no mood to have a swim with a dolphin.","The other day I was thinking - because I get a lot of headaches - I was wondering whether the head should be where it is. Because, at the end of the day, it's probably the heaviest part of your body, right? And yet it's at the top as opposed to, I don't, dangling at the bottom somewhere.","I've never thought about it before, but I suppose bad people might need someone to pray to, too.","It's not easy keeping a diary. You have to be pretty committed.","Getting old is better than being young. You can do what you want to do.","I don't know what the future is, but you just do it whilst it's there, don't you?","Parrots have gone a bit quiet since pirates have gone.","I'd say the best is when I was in Africa, I saw a hippo in a house.

I thought they had flat rendered sides, but when you get up close, you see how they are just giant boulders balanced on top of each other, like a massive game of Jenga that has got out of hand.","I found that being with happy positive people annoys me.","I sometimes wonder how we're short of cod. There's gonna be a load deep down that are hiding. But it's a good reason to put the price up, and it means a load of people will have haddock. They should tell people they're running out of all sorts. Make 'em panic a bit.","People eat duck and you think, well, we've got loads of chickens, leave the ducks alone!","Everyone is living for everyone else now. They're doing stuff so they can tell other people about it. I don't get all that social media stuff, I've always got other things I want to do - odd jobs around the house.

But what if I have one and then I regret having it? Has anyone thought of that option?","I've got loads of nieces and nephews.","I've done some luxury flying, which is brilliant. It has only happened once or twice, but it was nice because flying is the worst part of the holiday. But then again, if the plane crashes, you're still dead. For that much money I'd want a little capsule that whizzed me off to safety if it was going to crash.","I came face-to-face with a gorilla which was quite good, but it was a 10-hour trek in bad weather, up hills, covered in mud, with mosquitoes everywhere and when we got there the gorilla's just sat there doing nowt.","We'll all die out eventually. Humans will be gone. And all I'm saying is, when people worry about polar bears disappearing or whatever, it's like, 'Well that's life, things will come and go, we'll find new species.'","With evolution, things are always changing, so I sort of think: Should we all be growing three heads?","People who live in a glass house have to answer the door.","I am into nature and seeing whales. I went whale-watching, and I was really looking forward to that, but when you see it on TV and you see other programs do it, you're seeing close-ups of these massive creatures, and the music that's added gives you a certain feeling.","I've never won many awards, I didn't get certificates for swimming or anything.","I just sort of go along and say what I think -and that's all you can do in life, really.","I mean, I don't really go out at night in terms of noisy, busy places; I prefer more of a quiet corner somewhere.","I don't think I'd be a very good parent. I'd be too honest.","I think it's a problem when something's a dream because it'll never live up to your expectations. It's better to go somewhere thinking it'll be horrible, and then be pleasantly surprised.","When you've been on a programme called 'An Idiot Abroad' job offers aren't exactly flying in.","You know, when you're a producer, you're a bit of a lackey. You're just making cups of tea and making sure they've got newspaper, stuff like that.","Yesterday, I did some painting then went out to buy an onion and came home and watched 'University Challenge.' The onion was probably the highlight.","Sometimes you can know too much. A lot of brainy people like Stephen Fry are quite depressive.","If you go away with, you know, a girlfriend, wife, whatever, you have an argument on holiday because you're not used to spending that much time with people.","I've learnt that, even though I've travelled about, I haven't changed that much.","I think it's mental to pay for water. Where is that water coming from? Are they in the hills puttin' it into bottles when years ago it used to roll down and go into the lakes?","If you're doing the same job every day, there's room for error.","I don't want to go about offending people; that's not my plan.","To be honest, marriage doesn't scare me and that, it's just once you've been together for so long, if you haven't got any kids it's just a big expensive day out for everyone else to enjoy, isn't it?","If you'd have told me five years ago that I'd have done all this - two books, some television and everything - I'd panic, I'd be scared.","It's not a joke: I really do like being at home.","The reason I did the book about holidays is that you're a different person on holiday.

Americans know that this kind of spending will have economic consequences, including new taxes being imposed by the new progressives.","The difficulty for Mr. Obama will be when the public sees where his decisions lead - higher inflation, higher interest rates, higher taxes, sluggish growth, and a jobless recovery.","The claim made by Team Obama that every dollar in stimulus translates into a dollar-and-a-half in growth is economic fiction. The costs of stimulus reduce future growth. No country has ever spent itself to prosperity. The price of stimulus has to be paid sometime.","Mr. Obama has an ingenious approach to job losses: He describes them as job gains.","What Mr. Obama wants in a nominee isn't really 'empathy' and 'understanding.' He wants a liberal, activist Supreme Court justice.","I wish I had the billions of dollars that George Soros has that he has used to fund Democratic causes in the past.","You may be right that people say: 'You know what, we had Obama. He was inexperienced. The guy had great rhetoric, sounded good, looked good, but has turned out to be an utter disaster. I want someone where I have confidence and credibility that they're up to the job and that I can trust what they tell me.'","My parents, particularly my father, had been used by commentators, political journalists and political commentators, to attack me, and the collateral damage was the reputations of my father and my mother.","But, look, Washington is a town that creates myths for its own existence and its own amusement, and I was a subject of myth, sort of like Grendel in Beowulf - you know, not seen very often but often talked about.","You need to look at Congress as having a certain capacity. Now, the capacity varies from year to year and from body to body, but there is a finite amount of things that Congress can attentively do.","It's not comfortable for me to write about my family. I'm not comfortable writing about me.","The Tea Party movement is a wide and diverse group. It will hurt the Republican Party if some elements of the Tea Party decide to become third party advocates because it will split the conservative vote.","I left the White House in 2007. You know, I knew when I went there that it would be for a limited period of time. I was grateful that the average tenure of a white house senior aide is 18 to 20 months. I was there for nearly seven years.","I'll never get out of politics. I have friends in public office. I have things that I want to do. You can't go back in life. I won't go back to the existence I had before of running a political consulting firm and signing up clients and advising campaigns in exactly that way.","Well, I'm a Christian. I was a born a Presbyterian and became an Episcopalian.","I think if you talk to my colleagues, I was less than a fearsome individual.","I would have strong opinions and be prepared to argue my case, but if you talk to my colleagues, I think you'd find they consider me the jokester, the informal mayor of the West Wing.","Our competition for American business is no longer in the next county or the next state, it's around the world.","I mean, if you have to wake up in the morning to be validated by the editorial page of the New York Times, you got a pretty sorry existence.","Well, I don't want to become a prognosticator.","I know enough about European politics to know you've got a lot of crazy people who make their way onto the ballot.","In Europe and the United States, you've got different systems to select candidates, and no system is perfect.","Ronald Reagan wasn't in the establishment of the Republican Party either, nor was Richard Nixon.","If you look underneath the surface of the Tea Party movement, on the other hand, you will find that it is not sophisticated. It's not like these people have read the economist Friedrich August von Hayek.","I've been booed on stages. I'm a little bit tougher than to walk off a stage because someone says something ugly.","The world is a better place with Saddam Hussein gone.","I hate to sound sort of diffident about it but it strikes me that a lot of people on the right have got active lives and are doing other things.","I think wealthy conservatives are busy investing in profit and job creation and enterprise, and wealthy liberals, many of them either from the media industry themselves or from - they recognize the value of communications and are more ready to put money into a less profitable enterprise, namely the media.","And not only that, I also have the MacBook Air which is really cool. Even my wife is jealous of my MacBook Air.","And I think there's something about conservatives frankly - and the Left, when it comes to their channels of persuasion, are unpersuasive. They are, most of them are hate-filled, obscenity-clogged rants of anger and hatred.","Crossroads is second to none in our support of Tea Party candidates. In 2010 and '12, we spent over $30 million for Senate candidates who were Tea Party candidates. We spent almost $20 million for House candidates who were Tea Party candidates.","I supported Pat Toomey when he ran in 2010. I gave him money in September of 2009 because I wanted him to be the U.S. senator. I personally contributed my own money.","If you really want to diminish a candidate, depict him as the foil of his handler. This is as old in American politics as politics itself. It's easy to point at me. I'm convenient."],"Karl Schroeder":["Around 2005, the Canadian army tapped me to do a dramatization for a series of foresight workshops they'd done. They had stacks of papers and needed it boiled down to something simple enough for a 4-star general to understand. We decided to do it as a story. That's how I created 'Crisis in Zefra.'","The way I usually put it is that as an SF writer, I'm never required to be right.","I have been doing technology foresight for a number of years now on the level of scenario design, primarily. I want to become more rigorous with research methodology and statistical methods. I want to shift from creating clever SF scenarios to being a professional forecaster able to make rigorous predictions.","There's no possibility that foresight work will ruin my creativity. It goes to a different area than the creative wellspring of SF.","I thought of myself as an outsider in a lot of ways as I was growing up. Not in a bad way; more as an observer. I often find myself thinking as an observer of science fiction rather than as a participant.","My mother wrote a couple of romances when I was a kid, and I always saw books in our bookshelf with 'Schroeder' on the spine.","I intended to be famous by the time I was 16 and rich by the time I was 20. Curiously, it didn't pan out!","Starting on February 1, 2010, and running through until May 30, I will be Toronto Public Library's Writer in Residence, working out of the Merril Collection of Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Speculation at the Lillian H. Smith branch at College and Spadina.","Andy Clark refers to humans as 'natural-born cyborgs.' What he means is that we habitually extend and change our body-concept without even thinking twice about it.","Andy Clark has several books you can find on Amazon, including 'Natural Born Cyborgs' and 'Being There.' I particularly recommend 'Being There' to anybody who still thinks the Cartesian separation of mind and body should be taken seriously.","I remember the moon landings, and Apollo was the paradigm by which all progress was measured at that time. And I knew that creating a true space-faring civilization was both possible and practical. What I failed to realize was that the effort would fail due to bureaucratic inertia and political apathy.","Maybe it's because I look into the future professionally, but I see great possibilities for both humanity and our planet. I don't believe the thriving of one has to come at the expense of the other, and I'm deeply concerned to find out whether other people do think that.","If I want to speculate wildly about the future, I have my science fiction. Anybody who tells you they can predict the future is either crazy or lying.","The one thing we know about the future is that it will not be like today. I don't think that people should be too anxious about not knowing what they are going to do in the future, because we really can't know."],"Karl Shapiro":["But with exquisite breathing you smile, with satisfaction of love, And I touch you again as you tick in the silence and settle in sleep.","Lastly, his tomb shall list and founder in the troughs of grass. And none shall speak his name.","Poetry is innocent, not wise. It does not learn from experience, because each poetic experience is unique.","Already old, the question Who shall die? Becomes unspoken Who is innocent?","Laughter and grief join hands. Always the heart Clumps in the breast with heavy stride; The face grows lined and wrinkled like a chart, The eyes bloodshot with tears and tide. Let the wind blow, for many a man shall die.","The good poet sticks to his real loves, those within the realm of possibility. He never tries to hold hands with God or the human race.","To make the child in your own image is a capital crime, for your image is not worth repeating. The child knows this and you know it. Consequently you hate each other.","My soul is now her day, my day her night, So I lie down, and so I rise.","The doctor punched my vein, the captain called me Cain, upon my belly sat the sow of fear.","In the tight belly of the dead, Burrow with hungry head, And inlay maggots like a jewel.","The body, what is it, Father, but a sign To love the force that grows us, to give back What in Thy palm is senselessness and mud?"],"Karl Urban":["Nothing beats a great smile.","I don't see a benefit in accepting every single little morsel of work that comes along because I think, in essence, what you're doing is you're raping yourself really.","There's only so much you can do until you get on set and see the aesthetics of what you're dealing with. Then you see what the other players are giving to you. It's all about the transfer of energy between different actors.","It was always something I knew I was capable of and from an early age my mother was involved in the film industry. She used to work at a production company. So I was exposed to a renaissance period of films in New Zealand back in the early 80's.","That's always an interesting concept when you try to make your dream into a reality and you come up against the facts of exactly what it is you're attempting to do.","Now I'm this far up the ladder and I've got so much farther to go with what I want to achieve with it.","I did a little theatre work after that and the following year I got another part in a television series. Then it was almost to the end of the year before I got more work. That was coming to terms with the reality of the vocation I had chosen.","It's such a small industry here you inevitably end up working with the same people over and over again. There are only so many actors to go around, which is good for us.","I'll need every ounce that I have to drive it through. Film and TV require that energy. Sometimes fight scenes can be pretty intense. When I was shooting 'Heaven' it was truly guerrilla film-making.","When I work, I try to eat as much vegetarian as possible. When I do Cupid, I eat vegetarian because I need the energy. I've got those wings on my back.","That is a big danger, losing your inspiration. When I work in film and television I try to do each take a little differently. I never want to do the same thing twice, because then you're not being spontaneous, you're just recreating something.","My philosophy is whatever you do, you've got to invest in yourself. If you don't, there are a lot of people out there who will get the job because they're more prepared than you.","When you work so hard on making a film, it's all worthwhile when you get to experience seeing that film with an audience who thoroughly enjoy it and react to the movie.","I don't believe I could work as effectively at what I do without the support of my wife.","I love fishing and surfing, and I work out every day.","I'm high energy.","I was a fan of the 'Dredd' comics when I was a teenager.","If I read a script and find it engaging and I start making choices in my mind on how to approach the work, than that's a good indication that it is something worth pursuing.","I like the timeframe involved in being an actor.","I never envisioned when I was reading that comic as a 17-year-old that I would have the opportunity to actually play the character."],"Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel":["Every uneducated person is a caricature of himself.","Many a witty inspiration is like the surprising reunion of befriended thoughts after a long separation.","He who does not become familiar with nature through love will never know her.","Where there is politics or economics, there is no morality.","Reason is mechanical, wit chemical, and genius organic spirit.","Mysteries are feminine; they like to veil themselves but still want to be seen and divined.","Witty inspirations are the proverbs of the educated.","Mathematics is, as it were, a sensuous logic, and relates to philosophy as do the arts, music, and plastic art to poetry.","Combine the extremes, and you will have the true center.","What is called good society is usually nothing but a mosaic of polished caricatures.","Eternal life and the invisible world are only to be sought in God. Only within Him do all spirits dwell. He is an abyss of individuality, the only infinite plenitude.","An aphorism ought to be entirely isolated from the surrounding world like a little work of art and complete in itself like a hedgehog.","Religion can emerge in all forms of feeling: here wild anger, there the sweetest pain; here consuming hatred, there the childlike smile of serene humility.","A so-called happy marriage corresponds to love as a correct poem to an improvised song.","Beauty is that which is simultaneously attractive and sublime.","Art and works of art do not make an artist; sense and enthusiasm and instinct do.","In true prose everything must be underlined.","Wit is an explosion of the compound spirit.","The historian is a prophet looking backward.","Set religion free, and a new humanity will begin.","All men are somewhat ridiculous and grotesque, just because they are men; and in this respect artists might well be regarded as man multiplied by two. So it is, was, and shall be.","The difference between religion and morality lies simply in the classical division of things into the divine and the human, if one only interprets this correctly.","Many works of the ancients have become fragments. Many works of the moderns are fragments at the time of their origin.","Form your life humanly, and you have done enough: but you will never reach the height of art and the depth of science without something divine.","Irony is a clear consciousness of an eternal agility, of the infinitely abundant chaos.","A family can develop only with a loving woman as its center.","Whoever does not philosophize for the sake of philosophy, but rather uses philosophy as a means, is a sophist.","Novels are the Socratic dialogues of our time. Practical wisdom fled from school wisdom into this liberal form.","A definition of poetry can only determine what poetry should be and not what poetry actually was and is; otherwise the most concise formula would be: Poetry is that which at some time and some place was thus named.","There are writers in Germany who drink the Absolute like water; and there are books in which even the dogs make references to the Infinite.","The poetry of this one is called philosophical, of that one philological, of a third rhetorical, and so on. Which is then the poetic poetry?","There is no self-knowledge but an historical one. No one knows what he himself is who does not know his fellow men, especially the most prominent one of the community, the master's master, the genius of the age.","Every complete man has his genius. True virtue is genius.","Women are treated as unjustly in poetry as in life. The feminine ones are not idealistic, and the idealistic not feminine.","Irony is the form of paradox. Paradox is what is good and great at the same time.","All the classical genres are now ridiculous in their rigorous purity.","Nothing is more witty and grotesque than ancient mythology and Christianity; that is because they are so mystical.","One can only become a philosopher, but not be one. As one believes he is a philosopher, he stops being one.","Plato's philosophy is a dignified preface to future religion.","No idea is isolated, but is only what it is among all ideas.","One has only as much morality as one has philosophy and poetry.","What is lost in the good or excellent translation is precisely the best.","From what the moderns want, we must learn what poetry should become; from what the ancients did, what poetry must be.","Wit as an instrument of revenge is as infamous as art is as a means of sensual titillation.","It is peculiar to mankind to transcend mankind.","Think of something finite molded into the infinite, and you think of man.","He who has religion will speak poetry. But philosophy is the tool with which to seek and discover religion.","Like Leibniz's possible worlds, most men are only equally entitled pretenders to existence. There are few existences.","Versatility of education can be found in our best poetry, but the depth of mankind should be found in the philosopher.","The main thing is to know something and to say it.","What men are among the other formations of the earth, artists are among men.","Religion is absolutely unfathomable. Always and everywhere one can dig more deeply into infinities.","About no subject is there less philosophizing than about philosophy.","Considered subjectively, philosophy always begins in the middle, like an epic poem.","It is as deadly for a mind to have a system as to have none. Therefore it will have to decide to combine both.","Publication is to thinking as childbirth is to the first kiss.","The genuine priest always feels something higher than compassion.","Strictly speaking, the idea of a scientific poem is probably as nonsensical as that of a poetic science.","As the ancient commander addressed his soldiers before battle, so should the moralist speak to men in the struggle of the era.","Virtue is reason which has become energy.","Women do not have as great a need for poetry because their own essence is poetry.","Ideas are infinite, original, and lively divine thoughts.","In the world of language, or in other words in the world of art and liberal education, religion necessarily appears as mythology or as Bible.","Morality without a sense of paradox is mean.","How many authors are there among writers? Author means originator.","A critic is a reader who ruminates. Thus, he should have more than one stomach.","Since philosophy now criticizes everything it comes across, a critique of philosophy would be nothing less than a just reprisal.","Every good man progressively becomes God. To become God, to be man, and to educate oneself, are expressions that are synonymous.","An artist is he for whom the goal and center of life is to form his mind.","Novels tend to end as the Paternoster begins: with the kingdom of God on earth.","A priest is he who lives solely in the realm of the invisible, for whom all that is visible has only the truth of an allegory.","Kant introduced the concept of the negative into philosophy. Would it not also be worthwhile to try to introduce the concept of the positive into philosophy?","Duty is for Kant the One and All. Out of the duty of gratitude, he claims, one has to defend and esteem the ancients; and only out of duty has he become a great man.","Nothing truly convincing - which would possess thoroughness, vigor, and skill - has been written against the ancients as yet; especially not against their poetry.","The German national character is a favorite subject of character experts, probably because the less mature a nation, the more she is an object of criticism and not of history.","Aphorisms are the true form of the universal philosophy.","Religion must completely encircle the spirit of ethical man like his element, and this luminous chaos of divine thoughts and feelings is called enthusiasm.","Religion is not only a part of education, an element of humanity, but the center of everything else, always the first and the ultimate, the absolutely original.","Man is a creative retrospection of nature upon itself.","When reason and unreason come into contact, an electrical shock occurs. This is called polemics.","The essential point of view of Christianity is sin.","The surest method of being incomprehensible or, moreover, to be misunderstood is to use words in their original sense; especially words from the ancient languages.","God is each truly and exalted thing, therefore the individual himself to the highest degree. But are not nature and the world individuals?","Man is free whenever he produces or manifests God, and through this he becomes immortal.","A classical work doesn't ever have to be understood entirely. But those who are educated and who are still educating themselves must desire to learn more and more from it.","The subject of history is the gradual realization of all that is practically necessary.","Wit is the appearance, the external flash of imagination. Thus its divinity, and the witty character of mysticism.","If you want to see mankind fully, look at a family. Within the family minds become organically one, and for this reason the family is total poetry."],"Karl von Frisch":["After the first exams, I switched to the Faculty of Philosophy and studied Zoology in Munich and Vienna.","I received my doctorate from the University of Vienna in 1910.","I have been a Professor Emeritus since 1958, and have continued my scientific studies.","I studied at a grammar school and later at the University of Vienna in the Faculty of Medicine."],"Karla Souza":["I'm a night owl for sure. I was born at 1 A.M., and that's the excuse I use.","I've done about 15 movies and four television series in Mexico. My last two movies were the highest grossing in Mexican-cinema history - 'Nosotros los Nobles' and 'Instructions Not Included.'","I think people thought I was crazy for leaving Mexico when I had any project I wanted falling at my feet. But I risked everything to come to Los Angeles, where no one knew who I was, and start all over again. It was a very hard step to take. However, it was the moment I thought it was right to take a risk in my career.","I would love to be a professional athlete. When I was living in Mexico as a teenager, I did seven years of gymnastics and went to the Junior Olympics. I was getting to the level of going to the international competitions, but I was only 14, and my parents were really worried because they did not want that to be my life.","I used to work for a catering company - I waitressed for Harry Winston events. I remember being so hungry, I would eat when I was supposed to be catering to other people.","I'm a wannabe redhead, definitely wannabe Julianne Moore or Jessica Chastain redhead. But I love being a brunette."],"Karlheinz Stockhausen":["I have composed several pieces which are performed outdoors, not only in the auditoria.","No, what is important is neither linearity or non-linearity, but the change, the degree of change from something that doesn't move to other events with different tempos in particular.","And when they encounter works of art which show that using new media can lead to new experiences and to new consciousness, and expand our senses, our perception, our intelligence, our sensibility, then they will become interested in this music.","I no longer limit myself.","It is true that the eyes dominate the ears in our time.","Repetition is based on body rhythms, so we identify with the heartbeat, or with walking, or with breathing.","I spent most of the year in the studio for electronic music at a radio station in Cologne or in other studios where I produced new works with all kinds of electronic apparatus.","And I'm always interested when other musicians are trying to discover new worlds of sound.","But since the middle of the century in particular, the music has become very irregular in rhythm.","And the invention of transformations of certain figures has become the most important in musical composition.","Since I started composing I have always worked with series of tempos, even superimposed the music of different groups of musicians, of singers, instrumentalists who play and sing in different tempos simultaneously and then meet every now and then in the same tempo.","In particular what is most important to me is the transformation of a sound by slowing it down, sometimes extremely, so that the inner of sound becomes a conceivable rhythm.","Or the other process that is important is that I compress longer sections of composed music, either found or made by myself, to such an extent that the rhythm becomes a timbre, and formal subdivisions become rhythm.","Schaeffer gave me permission to work in the studio with a technician, but I've never worked with him.","Or in other works I have also projected the sound in a cube of loudspeakers. The sound can move vertically and diagonally at all speeds around the public.","And I'll never forget the first time I took the possibility to project sound every day for six or seven hours with special devices which were built for me.","One experiments and has to choose always the best results.","So there is a personal sense of style for a given work - I don't like a general style, but every work has its own style, and I want to create a style for every work.","Whenever I felt happy about having discovered something, the first encounter, not only with the public, with other musicians, with specialists, etc, was that they rejected it.","But I'm an adventurer. I like invention, I like discovery.","And harmony means that the relationship between all the elements used in a composition is balanced, is good.","But being quiet and meditating on sound is something completely different and will be discovered very soon by a lot of people who feel that the visual world doesn't reach their soul anymore.","I became aware that all sounds can make meaningful language."],"Karlie Kloss":["It's nice to just be a kid and hang out with your friends at lunch.","I'm somewhat in my own cloud.","If you believe in yourself and feel confident in yourself, you can do anything. I really believe that.","I have a notebook that is filled to the brim with my dreams and ideas and goals and aspirations.","I have a necklace with a golden key, given to me by my sisters, which I always wear.","I love kids, so two things that I have thought about are being a pediatrician or a kindergarten teacher.","I work strategically with my management team to make all decisions.","I think that taking ballet is one of the best things a girl can do. Period.","I wish I could fly. Or speak fluent Chinese. Both I think are equally impossible.","I think to have the skill set and the ability to physically help others in matters of life and death must be incredibly empowering.","Holy cow, in the course of one week I feel like I've lived about a year!","I'm learning Spanish - I got Rosetta Stone for Christmas.","Doors opened for me and I ran for it.","I'm not graceful.","I'm one of those tall, lanky, awkward kids.","Ballet really taught me so much about the power of movement.","I grew six inches in a year.","I just keep thinking how lucky I am that I haven't had to sacrifice anything.","My entire high school career - my entire school career - I've been like three feet taller than everyone in my grade.","Christy Turlington is my idol. She really is. She's a gorgeous woman inside and out. I admire her work in the charity field. She's just been able to balance it all - and gracefully, as well.","I have gotten to travel the world and experience all these incredible things thanks to my career.","There's no time for boys in my life right now.","I am very lucky to be surrounded and guided by an incredible support team comprised of my family and agents.","Because I'm so tall, clothes look different on me than they do on others.","I did every sport under the sun while growing up.","Whether running, biking, swimming, or dancing, I just like to always be on the move.","Growing up in a house of five girls, I couldn't help but glance at a fashion magazine or two.","Every single day I'm shocked.","MTV in general is involved with so many artists - musicians, actors, people in the fashion industry, and art world.","Today, models are able to share industry news, trends, and communicate with fans through Twitter, Instagram and blogs. So in a way, our position as models is way more personable and relatable.","I am very blessed.","I loved everything about Spain - the people, the language, and the food!","I would love to rent a little cottage or cabin in Colorado and learn to ski or snowboard. And on the warmer side, I also want to rent a house in Hawaii and learn to surf!","What I enjoy most is that every day I get to play a new character.","You learn to control every aspect of your muscles, your face, your toes, your fingernails.

The most astonishing and memorable experiences were my trips to Africa and Australia.","The beauty comes with the balance. Everyone should find his own balance in his personal as well as his professional life. Once you do so, you will feel and look beautiful.","There is the glamour side of it, which allows you to meet great variety of people with whom you simply can have a good time, but there's also the sad side of it that drags you into a superficial and artificial world.","Love yourself instead of abusing yourself.","Mother Nature made me the way I am, and I should be happy.","Unfortunately, modeling takes you with no transition from being a girl to being a business woman.","It is up to us to make the right choice and the right decisions.","Whenever I'm free, I spend time with people I love, people that inspire me in many different ways.","Hiking in undiscovered places is a lot of fun.","Remember who you are and where you come from; otherwise, you don't know where you are going.","What I love the most about modeling is that it opens you a lot of different doors of opportunities and takes you to many different places, which then put you in touch with various people and cultures.","There are so many people I wish I could have met:","My acting coach makes the impossible accessible.","Music is another great pleasure of life. I like all sorts.","It's a very hard and competitive business in which you have to fight every day in order to impose yourself.","I hope to continue building my acting career and work more on projects that fulfill my artistic thirst.","A girl who is interested in becoming a model must first accept the fact that she is the product.

But you can make it what you want it to be.","Everybody has some sorrow, worry, and everybody asks God for help.","I was raising seven kids. I lived in the bedrooms, in the laundry room, in the kitchen, in the car - car pooling all over. I just didn't have time to sit down and watch a lot of TV. So I really didn't.","I put the movie days totally behind me... It was a part of my past that I really kind of put in a little drawer and shut the door.","I never saw movies I was in because my mom told me that would be prideful, being stuck on yourself.","My mother died when I was 12, and right after, my dad died in a car crash.

After I lived in the Midwest, and I learned what sincere, real people were all about, I never wanted to go back.","I grew up in Hollywood during WWII, and my mother was afraid that my father was going to be drafted because she didn't think we were going to be able to live on army pay. She didn't want to have to get a job, so she decided to put me to work, and that's how I got started in the movies.","I started with the Target Company in 1993 when their Christmas theme that year was 'It's A Wonderful Life,' and they reunited the actors who played the Bailey kids. So we went all over and really had a blast getting the love from all of the fans and thought, 'Whoopty-doo, there's something going on here.'","My mother had early-onset Alzheimer's, and it took her four years to die.

Everything from now on is a bonus for me.","First round of the tournament being a Major, I think the butterflies were a little different than that.","I mean, I think I just it added to my excitement to playing today, and just going out there and doing the best I could, and no matter what happened, the end of the day was going to be a good end.","On one hand, it seems like I've waited a long time for this.","Golf is my boyfriend right now.","I only get to spend about six to eight weeks in Australia now and I really miss my family and friends.","I think Australian food is probably some of the best in the world.","Right now I'm still only 25 and I don't think the maternal bug has hit me yet.","I like other people's kids and being able to give them back when I want to.","You see that a handful of times every year where a person that hasn't been playing that well pops up and wins.","I think anyone that isn't fired up right now shouldn't probably be out here.","Like I said, I'm just trying to continue to improve and get better.","It was sort of just a family sport. My mom and dad were pretty keen golfers when I was young and so were my grandparents, and I just sort of tagged along with them.","There are great amateur bodies that have good programs right from the grassroots level to professionals.","I think it's as popular as it ever has been and it continues to grow as it does all around the world.","I think travel is probably the downside of playing professional golf, but you've got to do it.","If you don't enjoy it, then putting in the long hours is going to take their toll. If you don't enjoy it, then putting in the long hours is going to take their toll.","I've always wanted to be a professional golfer and I'm glad that came true.","I try to win every tournament.","It takes having your golf peak four different times throughout the year. You have to like all four golf courses. You've got to be the best of that week for the four weeks.","All four majors are definitely a priority.","Sometimes I don't understand why I'm sitting here.","I think I was given a gift to play golf and to be mentally strong.","I still can't believe that I've achieved what I have.

I never felt pretty or cared for.","The entertainment industry is vast and is a reflection of the society we live in.","My grandfather started his autobiography before he died; he never finished it. I would like to finish his autobiography because I finished mine.","We know what happens to little black boys that have no dads; we've heard that, we get it. But no one is really saying that young women who are born without fathers have real serious issues especially when their mother had no father and the mother has issues.","I have me. I have God. I have my son. Everything else is extra.","'Confessions of a Video Vixen' is not a book about my encounters with celebrities, or anyone else for that matter. It is my life story, thus far, which just so happens to include some people you may have heard of.","Something that always fascinated me was the psychology and the psychology differences between men and women and how we relate to one another.","Any good writer is going to be well-received and is going to not be well-received; that's how you know you're a great writer.","I've always had a man's mindset, and that's why I mostly have men friends, and that's why I've been around so many men. I've always been a tomboy. And any man that knows me will tell you I'm not a girly girl.","For women especially, it's important to be financially independent.","In certain parts of the world - where I'm at right now in New York, you're going to pay a whole lot more.

It's not always someone else's fault. If you're the common denominator in 57 different relationships that didn't work out, then maybe, just maybe... it's you!","Every man is different. You can't generalize with men; you have to find out what your man wants. You have to listen to him when he's telling you what he wants, because a lot of times they're telling you, but you're not listening.","Everyone in Hollywood is seeking fame and fortune; it's in the water here.

My dad's family had a general store, which I never saw. My grandparents on his side had already died before I started noticing things.","Until I was five, my immediate family lived near my grandfather's farm where my mother had grown up and, with the exception of a few modern conveniences, had not changed a lot over the years.","My grandfather milked several cows twice a day and supplied the neighbours with dairy products. He liked to go visiting around the county on Saturdays, and he also enjoyed the neighbours when they came by once a week with their empty milk jars. He walked them out to their cars and hung over the driver's side window until they drove off.","I went to high school in Columbia. I met my first wife, Richards, whom I married while I was working on a B.S. in chemistry at Georgia Tech. She bore Louise, and I studied.

It's experiencing the climb itself - in all its moments of revelation, heartbreak, and fatigue - that has to be the goal.","I think that idea that sort of our emotional self and our emotional life is a faucet that you turn on and off, and that we are in control of it entirely, that's a really appealing idea for a lot of people. But there are certainly the times where it's appealing to me, but it never quite works the way I hoped it would.","I've experienced a lot of successes. I've experienced a lot of failures. I've been able to get back up on my feet and keep going.","The nice thing about movies is that you can sort of steer your audience toward seeing that there's discomfort, but there's also this sense of, 'Well, we'll tolerate this weirdness because maybe it'll be interesting.'","I think that there's something about short films that just kind of keeps your muscles sharp.","Best advice: 'Just be yourself.' Worst advice: 'Just be yourself.'","It's important to tell meaningful stories and to find new ways to communicate those stories to people.","What might the world look like if we took some chances on the film-makers we might be afraid of?","The people in the decision-making positions need to be thinking differently about who to hire, and looking more unsparingly at their choices. Why give this person a break over that person? Why give this person a second chance over that person? I do think that's where gender comes into play.","I just know I have so much to teach my child. And I just feel kind of like, what would our world be without mothers? What would our world be without mother love? I don't think we'd have a world.","What fascinates me is that when we look at the history of women in politics, so frequently the women who get the farthest are the women who are quite conservative in their political views.","It's pretty gratifying to spend so long to make your first film and then feel like it got a lot of love - that was an incredible feeling. But there's something very distorting about that much attention. It felt like such a double-edged sword.","I think I was a pretty anxious dreamer, maybe a fundamentally lonely kid.","Day-to-day concerns really trumped big dreams for quite a while in my life. I was so freaked out about money. And until, honestly, I was in my early thirties and made 'Girlfight,' that anxiety was a real issue: How are you going to live? How are you going to survive?","I had no shortage of wild times in my youth.","Making movies, even though it's a business, is also an art, and sometimes you don't hit the bull's-eye.","Always keep absorbing art and looking at paintings and reading books and watching movies in other languages, just getting to know the world at hand and the world of the past. It's important to keep absorbing the world and keep engaging with it, and often that means not thinking about movies and thinking about other things.","'The Invitation' is a meditation on grief and loss carried within a suspense drama. At its core, it's about a dinner party gone horribly wrong and about the consequences of denying our pain.","We have to accept that making movies is a never-ending process of occasional progress, frequent setbacks, and unexpected curveballs being thrown our way. Navigating that process requires stamina, curiosity, openness, and creative fire.","Claire Denis's 'Beau Travail' is one of Denis's greatest achievements. One of the most mysterious and beautiful endings in movies.","It's extremely instructive to realize that you cannot do everything. You need to delegate, to find experts, to consult with them. A big part of the job of directing is knowing when to take something on and when you shouldn't.","Sometimes you realize that the thing an actor is asking for isn't exactly the thing they want. Maybe they're asking for more dialogue, or maybe they want a deep intellectual exploration of their role. But probably what they really need is encouragement.","As bad as some movies can be, good movies are also possible, sometimes through the very heinous corporations we love to trash.","I'm strong-willed, but that doesn't mean I can't work with people if we're all in the mission of trying to make a good movie.","I have had to really grapple with the fact that, while I wish things could be different at times, I ultimately needed to experience the transformation that comes with pain and loss and sorrow.","That's the most important thing for me is just figuring out how and if I'm growing as an artist.","I guess because there aren't many women working in the kind of variety of spaces that I've had the opportunity and privilege to kind of work in, that there is this extreme scrutiny about my career.","There are times when I'm kind of anti-social, I'm just really shy, and I don't feel like I fit in, and I then attribute that to some emotional state that's crippling me.","I understand the power of sorrow, and I understand how far it can take us from ourselves if we let it.","I don't necessarily believe that stories need closure. I just believe they need a beginning, middle, and end, but the end doesn't have to prevent us from continuing to grapple with the story at hand. It ideally should demand that we remain engaged with the story.","I think most women have to fight very hard for the opportunities they want, which isn't to say that most artists don't have to do that, male or female, but I'm definitely aware of just how difficult it is to find stories that interest me, particularly.","I was lucky to work with Gamechanger Films, who are a consortium of investors financing films directed by women. This is a company that puts their money where their mouth is.","I'm a director first and foremost, and I hope that the fact that I'm female is just one of the many things that informs my unique perspective on the world.","For me, there's something about a certain kind of genre film that has real potency in its emotional landscape.","If you look at most mainstream filmmaking, to be honest, some of these films aren't even asking questions anymore at all.","I get why we don't want to be in pain, but there's something very essential about what happens when we're in pain and some of the growth that can come from it if we stare at it straight in the face.","I would love to take another stab at really smart, speculative sci-fi - my first was a bit of a stumble. I look forward to getting another chance.","I was in a very lucky position to be able to consider studio films and had decided to not go that route for a very long time until I read a script that I loved called 'Aeon Flux.'","Genre mechanics are really tricky because if you pay too much attention to the idea of rules of genre, it becomes pretty stale, pretty fast.","Reading the script for 'Jennifer's Body,' I just thought that here was a script that really exposes the horror between girls and friendships. I always sort of approached the film with that in mind first, and then thought about the crazy ways that that horror would express itself.","It is important to know what audiences might expect from their genre movies, but I think it is also important to not give them everything they want. As a viewer, I think it can get pretty boring that way.","I think my narrative is actually pretty interesting if I step back from it and don't engage too much in it, personally or emotionally.","I don't think I could have had a better experience than I did with 'Girlfight.' It was a humbling experience to be so well received. And it was equally humbling to be ripped to pieces with 'Aeon Flux.'","I want to make big movies - but I don't want to have to die a little death every single time I do. Until I meet the people or the studio or the business people who will let me do things a little bit more the way that I need to do them, I probably shouldn't be making big studio movies.","It's very difficult to figure out, for me, what stops really talented young female filmmakers from having the kind of careers that their really talented young male counterparts are having.","I grew up in the Midwest. I understand a sense of the small-town mentality, small-town social politics.","Our society is constantly creating this framework for girls to feel that their only worth is their appearance, and it's damaging on so many levels to so many people.","There's something about the girls and the boys who just live for the moment and don't think a second beyond their needs and the here and now that, ultimately, is pretty tragic.","I don't get to make many features. It's not like that's something I can just snap my fingers and make happen.","I am a mother now, and I'm a mother to a son, and I want him to go into the world a feminist. I want him to go into the world with compassion for humanity.","I feel like, generally, the golden eras of cinema seem to be in moments of incredible political turmoil and strife and struggle.","When horror films are made in times of political strife, I think they're not made with an instinct to add to the chaos but to bring shape to it.","Making 'The Invitation' and waiting to make it on my terms and getting final cut and doing it the way I needed to do it was incredibly challenging, but it has really been so great for me. I'm so thankful that that's happened, that I got to work with actors I really like and have just such a good experience in delving into that story.","To me, sound is a crucial component to, really, any moviegoing experience, but particularly with suspense films or thrillers. I think you need the audience to become subtly really attuned to the soundscape in, like, this uncomfortable way.","I think there are always going to be people who say, even if they are engaged in the movie, they just want it to move faster.","I'm ultimately drawn to film many kinds of stories if they are sort of about unlocking the secrets of our human potential.","I ultimately am probably a pretty anxious person.","I'm just hoping that as I get older, and as more and more movies get made by female directors, what we start to see is how, in the same way good male directors get a shot at creating interesting male and female characters, women do as well.","When I reflect on the losses I've experienced, I've come to believe that those experiences were transformative, that they shaped who I am.","One thing I don't do anymore as I've gotten older is that I don't make big blanket statements about whether or not an artist is good or bad.","What kind of world is it if we allow people who are violent and do terrible things off the hook? What does that say about the world we're living in - it's like a world upside down, right?","It's hard to prep a movie in five days and shoot it in five days and cut it in barely any time. You don't get quite enough time to make the thing, let alone tell the story.","Polanski is a great example of a person whose personal life clearly has been just fraught with scandal and transgression and criminal acts. And yet, in 'Rosemary's Baby,' I think he's made one of the crowning feminist statements in film.","For better and for worse, I feel like sorrow and grief are really transformative personal experiences for me, and I question what I would be had I decided to take a different path and not embrace that kind of pain.","I assumed a business like a film studio would behave like a business and still want to protect its own interests, still do the best it could to get as many people paying for as many of their movies as possible. I realized this is not actually a business about business: it's a business of egos and dominance.","I don't want to direct a Marvel movie. I don't care about those mythologies.","I think there's a reason why some companies have such dismal records. It's not because they're clueless; it's because they systematically don't want to hire women.","What I do think is really interesting is that, as I get older and more mature, I'm really attuned to how frightening this world is that we live in.","Sometimes evil is in the form of a malignant clown, and sometimes evil is in the form of policy and legislators, and sometimes it's a grinning death mask and it has something more viscerally terrifying about it.","I feel a kinship to the idea of beloved stories and beloved pieces of art that we can imagine in different ways and sort of take a meta approach in terms of what those stories offer us.","Horror, almost better than any of the other genres, pits the will to live against the will toward nihilism. I just think that's worth exploring. I don't know what is more important, actually, to explore than that very dynamic.","One of the things you hear about when studying the nature of fanaticism is that a lot of the time, people don't start as fanatics. They shift and evolve into that state. That's a process, a systematic process of losing your identity and sense of self.","It's freeing to be able to consistently make creative decisions and ask creative questions of the team without feeling like, 'Does this make me vulnerable to getting canned?' That's a big part of being in a studio - they can always fire you.","I love horror. It's funny, because 'The Invitation' never struck me as horror, but it's definitely that type of thriller.","The best horror walks a line that's completely on a psychological level, not needing the typical tropes of traditional horror filmmaking, then also having to tease out those elements in a way that makes the audience feel like they know what they're in.","One of the uncertain pleasures of adulthood, for me, has really been about confronting how little I know about the world and how much completely baffles me about the world and human behavior.","For me, I guess I feel like the notion of 'feel good' entertainment... I'm all for it, but I just think you really, really, really have to earn it. I'm not sure I have a lot of movies in me where I see a world that earns it.","I would love to make lighter entertainments that have you sort of hopping and skipping and jumping out of the theater, but part of me just doesn't know how much I believe in that, as much as I want to.","I'd like to be making more films more frequently, but I do find that making movies, for me, has proven to be an extremely challenging road. No movie is easy; no movie has come together quickly.","I think there is really something we need to examine about the notion of careers, and are women encouraged and given the same opportunities to have vital healthy careers in which they are challenged by certain things, they try new things, they struggle, maybe they stumble, maybe they fail, and then there's more room to succeed as well.","I've been asked countless times, 'Why are you drawn to horror films? Why do you think women are drawn to horror films?' And it's because, in a way, it's one of the few genres that tells it like it is. A lot of times, women do feel like they're running for their lives somehow.","I'm very interested in dysfunction. I kind of realized in my first film that a character with so much rage that she didn't know where to put it was both heartbreaking and interesting to me.","I think being a young female star must be really, really pretty rough.","Along with loving the script, the reason I did 'Aeon Flux' was because I needed the job, and I couldn't find $5 million to make a movie independently - after making a fairly successful movie for a million dollars.","I do think there's a preoccupation that women understandably have with this idea of the roles we're meant to play and whether or not those roles serve us or ultimately kind of imprison us.","For me, I feel like I don't see myself as all that different from other humans as a woman, but I'm surprised by how frequently I'm asked to see myself differently.","I think we forget that part of parenthood means having to face and reject or face and embrace a kind of animal capacity for unkindness. And if, when, parents do embrace that, it reveals something very ugly to oneself.","To me, the thing that sets us apart from so many other animal species is our ability to ask questions, investigate, gather information, come to our own conclusions, and sometimes depart from the pack, sometimes move away from the tribe.","Sci-fi and horror, particularly, allow a storyteller to depart from, let's say, the demands of cinema verite or kitchen-sink realism or, even, just relatable dramas and can go into areas that are either - in the case of horror - more primally effective or, in the case of sci-fi, more speculative or imaginative.","The short form, for those people who can master it - and I am by no means one of them - it is very admirable, because it is really hard to tell stories that can stick with the audience and still be between 5 and 30 minutes long. I think it's a real challenge.","The genre of horror is really just a way to manage much larger, much more terrifying realities in our daily worlds.","Somehow, even though you have less time and less money, the thing about making indie films is somehow you have another kind of resource: a human resource, where you can really look to your creative colleagues and actually ask questions that are honest.","I think the crux of this urgent and real conversation about representation and diversity in art-making and storytelling both behind and in front of the camera ultimately has to do with simply seeing more human perspectives.","What makes a lot of suspenseful films work is very, very particular points of view and very subjective use of the camera.","A lot of the best suspense operates on a careful withholding of information as opposed to the doling out of information."],"Karyn Parsons":["Black history isn't a separate history. This is all of our history, this is American history, and we need to understand that. It has such an impact on kids and their values and how they view black people.","The problem with relegating black history to one really short month, the shortest month, is not only are we telling the same stories over and over again - which are amazing, George Washington Carver is incredible, there's nobody like Frederick Douglass - but there are so many.","I don't look like a model, but you have to work with what you got.","When I'm around black or white people, I'm always in the middle. Especially when I am around black people; they will really tell how they feel about white people regardless of the fact that I'm also white and have white relatives. It's very interesting and can be really hard.","I'm married to a white man, and then my daughter came out looking like the whitest white child with blonde hair and blue eyes. And I'm like, 'Omigosh, now what am I going to do?' She has my mom's features and is lighter than my husband. And my boy is browner than I am. Brown eyes and really tan.","My mother was a librarian, and she worked at the Black Resource Center in South Central Los Angeles and would call me to tell me stories that she read about that were interesting to her."],"Kaskade":["I have really fond memories of growing up in Chicago, and I always love going back. I still have a lot of really good friends from high school that I go to dinner with. It's kind of become a tradition when I go out there to do a show to give a few friends a call, tell some funny stories about high school and walk down memory lane.","Blending tracks and weaving and manipulating prerecorded music to create this mood, some people do it much better than others.","I DJ'd for years. I DJ'd in high school, and I think my parents thought it was a passing thing. And then when I was in my second year of college, I was like, 'Yeah, you guys don't need to send me money anymore. My DJ gigs are good enough. I'm selling music; I think I'm gonna have a record deal. I can pay my tuition.'","The producers and writers of dance music are becoming the stars, not so much the DJs.","I'm not the best singer in the world, but the albums have always been personal. They're stories about me and what I'm going through.","I'm more of an artist and a songwriter than I am a DJ. That word seems a little bit - well, it doesn't really describe what I do.","Dance music will always be around. People around the world love to dance.","Listening to music is such an uplifting, spiritual thing. It's far-fetched to some - I understand that. But the way dance music brings people together, it's not a big stretch from hymns.","I'm a person who has always been clear about my love of music and vocal about trying to live in a way that lends itself to health.","I think people look at dance music and see it as kind of a bad thing, and bad people hang out in nightclubs, but it never felt that way for me. Growing up in Chicago, music was the thing that saved me, that kept me on the straight and narrow.","People know my lyrics; they know the stuff I've written, and it's all about life, love, happiness, and these big euphoric moments. It would always bug me when I'd go to a club, and they're playing some chick on a stripper pole on the monitor behind me. I'm like, 'So that's not what I do - that's the other guy.'","I think how Chicago plays a role in my life - it had such a role in my youth and the decisions that I made as a kid and formulated who I am as an artist early on.","It's interesting: in the late '80s, there was this really random mix of new wave, industrial, and these early house records. And a lot of it was coming out of Chicago because of Wax Trax! So I always visited Wax Trax Records.","People don't listen to terrestrial radio. They don't find their music that way. They don't get their news that way. They go to blogs. They go through Sirius/XM. They go through all these different places.","I studied communications, only because I could get my own show on the campus radio station. I never thought of it as a career. Music was always a really passionate hobby - it was like collecting DVDs or stamps.","When I graduated college, I had a fairly successful weekly club gig and was buying more studio equipment and writing my own music. I realized I didn't want to work.","Once I wrote 'Atmosphere,' I thought, 'This is my story; it's me and my life and what I've gone through to get to where I am.' I'm not the best singer, but still. All of my albums are personal, but putting myself out there and singing is one more thing that makes me vulnerable - one more thing that people can fire shots at.","I've always been a big advocate of making shows affordable because a lot of these bottle-service clubs and events are geared toward really expensive experiences. Club music is for everyone, and it drives me crazy that people are getting priced out.","When I can control my own show, I want the price to be affordable so fans can actually see me. It's a challenge because I have to do a lot of navigating to make the production stellar but do it on a realistic budget.","A lot of people see electronic music as a flavor of the week, but it can be more than that - has to be more than that.","Club culture is about leaving your cares behind, and I am trying to create that environment.","If you listen to a Deadmau5 record or a Skrillex record, I really enjoy that stuff because, as aggressive sounding as the Skrillex records are, they're still musical, and that's why they have such a broad appeal.","I think there is some truth to the fact that yeah, okay, cool, obviously the more mainstream kind of easier-to-grasp-onto dance music has become popular, but that holds true with almost any genre. It wasn't like the Sex Pistols hit the radio. It was poppier versions of that is what hit. It's never, like, the true core stuff.","It's weird, when I go back to San Francisco, the few times that I've done shows there since leaving, it still feels like I live there. It's very, very strange for me. That's where my daughter was born, at UCSF. I have this huge attachment to San Francisco. It's like a love affair.","When you go see a good DJ, you'll know it, man - you'll know it in your bones. Between the guy who's phoning it in and the guy who's obsessively working it to give you the best show of his life.","To do more of a concert thing, it takes so much preparation. You don't just show up and wing it. You're putting countless hours in the studio, not just to write and produce stuff, but to come up with edits and special things for the show.","I travel a lot. I spend close to 300 days a year on the road.","I don't feel that electronic music has to stand on the back of urban artists or anyone else to be recognized. It's great music.","I think people in electronic music are trying to get these big features: 'Oh my gosh, I'm gonna get the biggest pop star to feature on my track.'","For me, 'Atmosphere' was more about looking inwards and reaching out to people close to me. To emphasize the fact that I'm singing on the first single, this album is really more about me and songs that I've written instead of collaborating with people.","I do feel like there's a level of ridiculousness going on in electronic music... It's getting borderline absurd out there.","As a kid, my parents had the typical stuff going on in the home, like Bee Gees, The Carpenters. Then I got exposed to what my brothers were listening to: a lot of classic rock, Led Zeppelin. It was around the mid-'80s when the whole Electro-Techno-Pop-House music thing started happening in Chicago.","Music leaves such a big impression. I always wondered, 'Man, if I grew up in Nashville, would I be making Country records now?' I honestly feel like Chicago had such a big impact on me.","I love a great melody and wonderful lyrics that speak from the heart, and my music has that and speaks about it; but there's just something that was really raw and energetic about the early House music. It's hard to describe. It's like you had to go to these parties where the stuff was being played on these huge sound systems to really feel it.","I think that most people who hire me to do a remix just want it to work in a nightclub, whereas when I'm writing my own album, I don't have to worry so much about 2 A.M.","There is so much great talent in the underground, and electronic music is finally getting the props that it's deserved for so long. I feel like now that everyone is discovering it and it's so fresh sounding to so many people. It doesn't get any more rock n' roll than playing EDC or the Staples Center. It's really madness.","The art of DJing is sharing music with one another... The technology's definitely taking it into a new direction to where it's really becoming performance-based.","People book me because of the songs I write, not because of the sets that I play, per se... I'm sure I'm going to be moving to a laptop really soon, but I was one of the last guys to let the vinyl go. I was crying. In my room, I still have thousands of records. I still pull them out and play them all the time.","Mix CDs are interesting. I'm known more for my artist albums and less for my mix CDs.","Music evokes a lot of different emotions and triggers different senses.","I've always had a passion for music, but I never saw me as a musician for a living. I never thought that I could make a living. It never dawned on me."],"Kaspar Hauser":["I want to be a soldier as my father was.","Many cats are the death of the mouse.","Why you kill me? I never did you anything. Not kill me! I beg not to be locked up. Never let me out of my prison - not kill me! You kill me before I understand what life is. You must tell me why you locked me up!"],"Kassie DePaiva":["On 'The Guiding Light' I enjoyed working with Jamie Goodwin and Ellen Parker, who played my sister. I loved working with Jerry Ver Dorn and Jay Hammer. I mean, there's some great fun people that I've really enjoyed.","If you can't hear language, you won't be able to understand language and experience normal development. Every minute spent without hearing is a minute a child is not getting back.","The beauty of soaps is that it takes a village to make it work, and you get to work with really hardworking people.","Are you loving having these great iconic stories back as much as I am? 'One Life' is back in action and I love putting my 'Blair on' again.","I have played Blair Cramer for 20 years, I feel a personal investment in the success of 'One Life to Live.' I love the show, I'm a fan of the characters, and I have invested in the journey these fictional characters have traveled.","I can't say enough about 'OLTL's' strong cast.","Singing has always been a part of my life. I started at Opryland singing, and I realized I could make a living at it. I thought it was something I would grow out of. I didn't know what I was going to do with my life. Everything's just sorta fallen into place.","People always ask, 'Do you wanna do movies; do you wanna do other things?' But they haven't fired me from 'OLTL' yet. When that happens, I'll make that choice.","'OLTL' has now allowed me to sing through the character as Blair. If you've followed my 20-some-odd-year career, you know I am a singer.","'The View' was so much fun. So much fun because the audience was 85-percent fans that wanted to be there celebrating 'One Life to Live' and the other 15 percent were crew members from 'One Life to Live'. It was just really, really wonderful and the clips were wonderful.","Music has always played a big part in my life and, believe it or not, in my soap opera career.","I love playing Blair Cramer, and I'm thrilled to see what more they have in store for her. After playing this role for so many years, I still feel like there is so much about her that is still untold.","If you're happy with who you are, that's going to show, and you don't have to apologize for anything.","Such crazy things happen on daytime TV; if you were to take a specific scene out of context, it can sound so far-fetched that you start laughing at the material... and that can take you out of watching the performance.","That's what's so special about 'One Life to Live:' it's just this real family in the sense of, we're only as strong as our weakest link. It behooves us to help people who haven't done the genre because it makes us all look better.","As a mom, you do what you have to do without even thinking about it.","It might sound odd, but filming a soap is closer to acting in a play than filming episodic television."],"Kat Dahlia":["I'm from a Cuban family, so we're used to talking really loud. You come to a Cuban restaurant anywhere in Miami, and we're practically screaming at each other.","Growing up in Miami, I had all these great, strong influences. You know, being Cuban and the Latin influence, but also the strong hip-hop influence.","I know that people everywhere listen to hip-hop, but especially being from the South, you really get that influence. You go out, you party, and it's just always there. Also, I grew up listening and loving reggae music, too.","I'd want to collaborate with Eminem, of all people. Maybe even Lauryn Hill.","With relationships, I've been through a lot of different situations with different people, and I write about it.","I just want people that like my music to like me.","I'd love to work with Michael Buble, with Tony Bennett, with Damian Marley, with Andrea Bocelli.","I see myself traveling; I see myself with a much bigger living space than I do have right now. I see myself hopefully on a tour bus at some point."],"Kat Dennings":["I don't know, I like the word sassy.","I think you can tell when someone is being dishonest as an actor.","I'm a reclusive weirdo.","I have friends who are so sarcastic but I never view it as mean.","I've played every instrument you could possibly think of for 10 minutes. So I'm mediocre at everything. I can play drums, guitar, piano, violin, saxophone, clarinet, flute... Just not well.","I don't really think about doing something kind, I think there's just a way to conduct your daily life with compassion to other people.","I have nothing to hide!","I'm really nearsighted, which has served me well.","I've never dyed my hair, never fixed my teeth or gotten a tan.","I'm really comfortable with myself.","I can watch a movie and go, 'Oh, my god, that person is acting.' If you just listen to what the other person is saying, your response will always be genuine.","The more unsettling the more I feel at home.","I was a very unique child.","I am very outspoken, obviously, and I should say that I can't judge anyone for doing anything.","I always hold doors open, I always try to be nice.","I was a Girl Scout!","I want to see as many movies as I can and I covet a lot of weird influential movies.","Quirky is what a guy would call a girl he doesn't understand.","My mom took me to a Dolly Parton concert when I was 3.","There's stuff I don't like to rehearse, really emotional things, I don't like to rehearse. You just beat it to death.","I'm a very safe saver. I save everything. I save all my money and my parents raised me like that.","People make the mistake of drinking the Kool-Aid, believing your own hype, letting people tell you you're this or you're that or you're too this.","I'm from Pennsylvania, so I was in New York a lot and my brother lives in New York.","I was a home-schooled kid, living in the forest, and I didn't even have cable. I'm serious.","I wasn't a rebel.","I haven't actually studied acting at all.","My first audition was for a commercial for the lottery. I didn't get it, so I hate the lottery.","Actors make less than you think.","I'm still wearing Target and hand-me-downs.","I buy food and gasoline - that's it.","I've never been in jeopardy, but being an actor is a pretty shady place to be because you never know where your next job is.","I really am pretty boring. There's no reason to take pictures of me.","I don't think I've had a holiday in my entire life that wasn't about my dad's work.","If I had a robot friend, he or she would be electric.","If you don't like me, it's your problem.","Although anything can happen when under the influence of ice water.","Oh I'm a huge comic book movie fan.","There aren't as many girl superheroes, but there are cool ones. Banshee, for instance.","I would love to do a period movie. I've always wanted to wear the corset, you know. It's a girl thing!","I don't die in anything!","People are ruthless, man.","I've been really lucky.","I wrote a script with my brother which ended up, somehow, on the Black List in 2008.","Any glamorous moment you might mistake me for having is always pretend.","I can't imagine wanting to be famous just for the sake of being famous. I think fame should come along with success, talent.","I tried being anorexic for four hours, and then I was like, I need some bagels.","I can say that I had a particularly painful teenage-hood."],"Kat Edmonson":["I want to tour, everywhere I can, all of the world.","When I was very young I knew that I wanted to be in show business. I knew that I wanted to be an entertainer.","I have a very specific memory of watching 'Singing in the Rain,' and looking at myself in the mirror after watching it and perceiving myself as one of those people that I was just watching on T.V. It was just kind of a knowing that this would be the world that I would enter into. And that's what I did.","I would spend hours absorbing every intonation, every inflection - how the singer would convey a sentiment and how it would sound coming out of their head. All of those things I very carefully watched and absorbed, and so I guess I was studying my whole life, although not in any sort of conventional way.","I started growing my audience in small clubs through word-of-mouth. I started making music that isn't necessarily commercially viable, and it's not necessarily marketable to my peers to a certain extent.","The first song that I remember writing in its entirety was when I was 9 years old. I wrote it on a bus, on a field trip. It was called 'Mystery Man,' and in retrospect, it was the beginning of my exploration of what it was like to have a man in your life, because I didn't.","I grew up with my mom; it was just the two of us.","When I tend to belt, it kind of reminds me of like a more '60s girl doo-wop kind of belting.","Few things parallel the bonding that occurs post-performance when congratulatory remarks are awarded, regrets are confessed, and gossip is exchanged.","New York musicians rarely have the time for idle chat and conversation after a gig. Despite popular assumption of our scintillating after-hours, that illusion is overtaken by the constant hustle to juggle a part-time or full-time job, a myriad of errands, a second or third gig of the day, and perhaps a child or two somewhere.","Growing up, my imagined life as a musician was something along the lines of me lounging in a Learjet en route to a swelling outdoor amphitheatre on a dazzling summer's eve.","Jazz is progressive, and it's alive.","When I was driving home after registration, I heard this song on the radio, a guy singing about not ever going to class in college and always hanging out and singing for his friends. I laughed and said, I can relate, because it was so much like me. I realized right then I would pull out of school and pursue a music career.","I want to play more festivals.","I'm always inspired to write, and it's usually my own life experiences that inspire me.","Very often, writing a song is a process that happens to me rather than one that I instigate. I feel a song coming on and, like a sneeze; I wait for it until it comes.","For 'Way Down Low', I was particularly inspired by a breakup I was going through and a transition I was making from Austin to New York."],"Kat Graham":["There was a time when men thought it was sexy to have a housewife waiting for him to come home from work in her slippers, but in modern society, I think an independent woman is even more sexy.","I think sometimes when you want attention, you can wear sunglasses, and people are like, 'Who is that?'","I have more of a desire to write songs about being an independent woman than being in love, songs about getting up and moving on even if I have a broken heart.","I love being on tour; I love being on the road. It's the most amazing feeling ever. I live for it; I love it.","I am more vintage than I am high fashion.","I like different statement jewelry, especially around the ears.","When you're an entertainer, it's hard not to compare yourself with the next person's success. But you have to trust your own journey and your strengths and believe in yourself. I think that's the best place to start.","I have more of a desire to write songs about being an independent woman than being in love, songs about getting up and moving on even if I have a broken heart. 'Wanna Say' is one of the few love songs I've ever done.","When people start to think they're figuring out 'The Vampire Diaries,' it switches on you.","I think that with beauty, people jump to the end instead of starting from the beginning with a good lotion or prep.","I like darker, mysterious scents and things that reflect my personality.","My style is not trendy by any means; my inner artists loves to shine through in my wardrobe.","I'm into Gucci a lot, like vintage '70s everything. I'm into Versace.","I love outdoor winter activities like snow tubing and snowball throwing.","When you get bullied, you automatically think that you're the reason why you're getting bullied. The reality is, it's about them, not you... I'm all about blocking people. I'm all about saying, 'You know what, I don't need this in my life.'","Water for People is a non-profit international organization that brings together communities, entrepreneurs, governments - people - to create solutions that empower people to maintain their own reliable water systems and sanitation.","You make your mark by being true to who you are and letting that be your staple.","I'm obsessed with cooking! I want a degree in the culinary arts!","To me, success is making a positive difference through art - making art that affects the world and that changes the way people feel about themselves and the world.","I had racially prejudiced comments directed at me on different blogs. People think that just because you're in the spotlight, you're fair game. It's hard, and I don't think you're ready at any age for it. Thankfully, I have some great fans who got me through it.","I'd rather be hated for who I am than loved who I am not. Even if you're not accepted, at least you are still yourself.","Sometimes what I think what the news is missing is the human element, the connection - the moment that you look into a little girl's eyes or a father who has just left his family and risked everything just to try and survive.","Listen, I'm not a politician. I'm not a news reporter. I make music, and I act.","If a boy messes up, you walk away. If a boy isn't treating you right, you walk away. It sounds simpler than it is, but you can't allow yourself to be disrespected. You have to be a strong girl.","I feel like I can't be sick without some story being made up or some photos being sold a month later.","I'm still somebody that listens to a lot of James Brown, a lot of The O'Jays, a lot of TLC... in that era, producers had more musicianship.","I have to hear more live instrumentation, more band and more funk, and I don't hear enough of it, so I created it myself.","I've always been involved with charities and things like that, but when I started communicating with the fans and hearing their stories about the lives they lead, it really made an impact on me.","Anyone who knows me knows what I'm about - how much I'm into empowerment, equal rights and everyone just loving themselves.","I'm very strange, I'm not going to lie.","I actually got a play from auditioning for something in 'Back Stage' magazine.","If I have an audition, I go to the audition in character. I'm in character when I walk in the room. I mean, I'm still sweet to everyone, but I'm very much the character.","I completely took off my eyebrows one time for a screen test. I hadn't even gotten the role yet. So you have to have a commitment.","If I was on Broadway, I would want to do anything Vaudeville or a biopic.","I'm all about high-waisted pants and skirts, pencil skirts, and sheer, long-sleeves in the summer.","I used to read the criticism on blogs about other people - mostly female actresses and singers - and even when they are extremely perfect and harmless, people still go after them. So I figure, if I'm going to get negativity regardless, why do I have to worry about what somebody thinks of me?","I like the idea of being so passionate about everything I do and the fact that I might wake up tomorrow and say 'I want to be a chef,' and just pour myself into that.","I'm happy when I have, like, one fan, but the fact that I'm getting fans from different places and different communities, it's really amazing.","My first show was in front of 30,000 people with will.i.am, and I wasn't even that nervous.","I just want get to as high as I can go. I think that's the safest and most politically correct thing I can say. I'm not trying to take anyone's spot. I want to create my own lane and shoot to the sky.","I'd really like to work with Gwen Stefani and Cee Lo.","I think the hardest thing to do in a relationship is something for yourself.","I never want to be a spectacle, but I also feel like a look should always have a little bit of an edge.","I run away from super-bandage-style Herve Leger dresses. I think it's sexier for a woman to be in something sheer and loose.","My experience with music, I'm not going to say extremely negative, but it's definitely been a grind; it's been grimy - it hasn't been a pretty process. It's left me crying, you know, on the carpet in my tiny apartment with, like, no money. But it's been worth it, it's my passion, my dream, it's what I love to do.","I just want to live on the road. I can't understand artists that don't want to perform and, like, get on stage and do their songs for all their fans every night. If I'm not performing every night, I get totally depressed. I know that sounds really weird, but I hate sitting at home and not having a 1 A.M. performance now. It kills me.","My biggest style inspirations come from the '90s. I'm really inspired by TLC, Janet Jackson, and designers like Jeremy Scott. I'm hugely inspired by Club Kids from New York back in the '90s. I'm inspired by the drag queen scene. Combat boots and the torn off jeans and a baggy shirt - I love that look.","I just don't drink alcohol. I never have; I never will.","In 10 years, I don't really know what I'll be, and I like not having any idea. I like the idea of being so passionate about everything I do and the fact that I might wake up tomorrow and say 'I want to be a chef,' and just pour myself into that.","I think that with 'The Vampire Diaries,' you never know what's going to happen, and I don't think the characters necessarily know, either. So you can only weigh so much, and then it might just come down to 'kill or be killed.'","If you're cast on 'The Vampire Diaries,' the likelihood of you dying is very good.","I hope to do multiple characters throughout my life that are separate from me. I think it's a cop-out if you play yourself in everything.","My first audition as a little girl was 'Interview with the Vampire' for Kirsten Dunst's part. Back then, they were meeting all different kinds of girls, and I was one of them. There's got to be an audition tape somewhere on VHS. Who would have known that many years later I would be on a vampire show?","'Blade' was amazing; I can't imagine the character without Wesley Snipes. He just made a long, black leather trench coat look so cool.","Will Smith is one of my favorite actors, and he's also a triple threat. He successfully crossed over from music into acting. Also, I liked 'I Am Legend' because it was so unexpected. The movie wasn't what I thought it'd turn out to be.","I'm not somebody who's emotionally attached to an outcome of a character that I'm hired to play. The fans are.","It's important for me to just be myself - in fashion. A lot of people overlook that side of me because they're scared of it, but that's just who I am.","I think it's important to have your own individual style and sense of self. It's kind of what I do.","I don't really have a main source for my style inspiration. It's really about however I feel about myself at the moment.","I'm a smoky eye girl. I love playing with eye colors, metallics... fun stuff!","I've been doing acting since I was 6 years old, and I don't know how to do anything besides act and sing. Back in the day, you had to do it all - you had to sing, dance, and act. I'm from the old school where that is what I was trained to do, and that's what I am expected to do, so it's weird when people ask me to choose.","On my days off, I love denim cut off shorts with gladiator sandals and crop tops.","I love to add '90s trends mixed with modern day pieces I find along my many travels. Like these cool fun hats from Europe I have. I love to collect different ones from every country. I have them from London to Brussels.","The hardest thing as somebody who does both is - and I'm very serious as an actor, and I consider myself very serious as a musician, engineer, music artist - is learning that it's OK to be versatile.","I'm really into kind of finding different masculine pieces and making them feminine. Like cool oxfords.","Take chances, find your voice in fashion, and find what you like, and find what makes you feel good, and do that.","Sometimes fashion designers will be like, 'This is what's hot right now, and you will be cool if you wear this,' but sometimes it's too expensive or doesn't look good on me or isn't who I am, and I don't need to just think that what you're saying is what's cool if I have my own identity.","I'm hoping I'll eventually get to be a beauty blogger myself because I do my own makeup, and I have for years.","I think magazines and interviews make celebrities into this bigger-than-life thing, but I've gotten bullied over trying different things with my makeup.","I found my style and how I like to do makeup from trying and failing and trying and failing again, and unfortunately, I had to do it publicly to figure it out.","I'd say when it comes to being who you are, just don't be afraid to try things.","I only write in blue ink.","If you don't feel clean, it affects everything you do; you can't even focus right.","There's a common misconception that you don't need SPF during the grey winter months, but it's so important to protect skin from UVA/UVB rays year-round.","Even if you throw your hair up in a quick topknot or ponytail, you can add instant polish by wearing a headband or bejeweled barrette.","I love sparkly eyes for the holidays, especially New Year's Eve.","I was raised in Hollywood by my mother.","Make your life about you, and once you build up yourself first, then you can focus on boys.","It's important to keep your power and not give it up.","I'm more of a tough girl, and I'm attracted to things that reflect that in my perfumes. That means sandalwood, musk, amber, and vanilla notes.","I follow so many beauty bloggers on Instagram.","I don't feel like I necessarily juggle. I just feel like I'm focusing on being a singer/actor. That's what I am, and it's what I do.","When you're changing your diet, or you're becoming a vegan, your system will become a bit more sensitive, and you just have to deal with it.","I'm a human being, and I get sick.","It's really important, especially for young girls, to see that if you fall down, you get back up. If you get sick, you get back up. People are going to say what they want.","I don't have the kind of style that I feel like would serve any and everyone.","People automatically assume that because you're an actor, you're a blank canvas 24/7. But I can't wear what everyone else wears. If I went to an audition, I'd wear what the character would wear, but the moment I'm done with the audition or done filming, I go back into my high-waisteds.","I get a lot of backlash for wearing designers that I feel are creators and artists. I get it all the time.","I love anything that makes you feel empowered. I'm 'bout that - you can't be scared.","I just don't stop working.","I'm still dreaming to be the next Missy Elliott.","I love a cool bralette paired with a high-waisted jean, maybe with Chanel suspenders and a good platform shoe.","Live performances always feel like such a moment with all of the costumes and theatrics.","You just can't afford to care that much about the negative things people say about you. You just can't!","I started off as a recording engineer and a beatmaker. I was this skater kid that would skateboard to auditions, and then I would use the money I'd make and buy a bunch of equipment and make a bunch of beats. I still am that kid, just with a little more money.","I just wanna be a good artist.","I just want to make sure that I'm taking roles that are positive, real, honest reflections of African-Americans because I do think the media can put African-American women in the background. Then, unfortunately, what happens is, subconsciously, our culture begins to assess that as reality.","You have to be very careful with the art you create and you put out.","If you're a boxer, you have your trainer. As an actor, I have Ivana Chubbuck. She's my teacher as an actress and in this crazy thing called life.","When I see other working actresses that are brown, I get so excited. I get so excited when I see Zoe Kravitz, Janelle Monae, Taraji P. Henson, Ava Duvernay, and all these beautiful women working.","There's not enough black films out there. There's not enough Latin films, or films that have an Asian, Indian or Middle Eastern lead. The list goes on and on.","All the great artists had their dark sides. Look at Amy Winehouse or anyone who has achieved a certain level of success. Even Adele, and the people that you wouldn't put in the same category as a gangster rapper. These women have exposed their vulnerabilities, demons, and things that have hurt them.","I don't want to be alone at 80 years old, dripping in diamonds - having never helped anyone. That's not my path. That's not what I care about. That's not what excites me.","Tupac has always been somebody who represented a higher consciousness of what it means on both sides of the coin to be black in America. He and Prince were leaders who moved to the beat of their own drum, and I can only hope to follow in their footsteps.","I'm somebody who doesn't believe in conforming to maybe whatever is on the radio.","Work always comes first as an actor.","I think a lot of young girls see actresses, and they think of red carpets, and they think of 'Us Weekly,' and they don't really think about the breaking down of a script and what that requires and what you would need to pull it off.","I learned about poise and dignity, and I learned about what it means to be an African-American in television and what that requires in terms of what kind of position you take for yourself and how you define your own reality in a world that is still finding its footing, to say the least.","I learned that it's OK to be stubborn about your craft, and it's OK to demand excellence from the industry.","I'm like, 'Why aren't artists owning their masters? Why are labels robbing artists dry, and they have to spend all this time on tour to even break even?' Like, what happened? Why are they promoting things that aren't either socially conscious or elevating the human consciousness?","I want to be someone who is a great representation of a black woman in Hollywood, a black woman in the entertainment industry.","I'm an activist. I'm a proud activist. So I want to be someone who is pro-black and pro-Africa and still be somebody that has positive influence.","Before 'The Vampire Diaries,' I was making beats, which is how I got will.i.am's attention, and I went on tour with him.","'Roxbury Drive' was the street I grew up on as a little kid, and it was the street that I first listened to records on, and where I actually really first fell in love with music.","I think Sephora is great; it's so accessible, and there are so many different palettes that you can get.","MAC Cosmetics is incredible for lips; I always wear it.","It's so important to get your skin to look even, whether it's with a MAC Cosmetics glow, a Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer, or even just a solid foundation. Start off with a good prep and a good primer.","When I first started performing, the only community that truly got what I was trying to do was the LGBTQ community.","When I moved to Atlanta, I felt like an outsider - away from my friends and family except for the LGBTQ community.","I think with girlfriends, you always want your girlfriends to make the decisions for themselves, not based on a boy, not based on anything other than, 'Is this what you want?' Is this you know what you want to do?' And that's real support to me.","I'm somebody who listens to a lot of funk, a lot of James Brown, and I want to be somebody who contributes all that energy to the mainstream.","There's not one day that goes by that I'm not listening to one of my songs or in rehearsal for one of my songs or dancing to one of my songs.","I wanted to be the first female, young teenager producer, and it didn't happen. And when it finally did happen, I was shelved because I was signed to Warner Bros.","I can't understand artists that don't want to perform and, like, get on stage and do their songs for all their fans every night.","I would really love to collaborate with Gwen Stefani and M.I.A.; artists that kind of make sense with me vocally. And in terms of style, I'm a very visual artist. I really love Pharell. I love people that really care about drums, and I like beat-heavy.","Will Smith is one of my favorite actors, and he's also a triple threat. He successfully crossed over from music into acting.","I like that the 'Underworld' series created a whole other world that's totally different yet familiar to our own.","When people are like, 'What do you think of this vampire craze?' - well, I don't really feel like it ever ended, personally, 'cause I've always been into them, like 'Underworld.'"],"Katarina Johnson-Thompson":["I can't change my personality. I'll always smile, but I'll be more focused.","You don't have to be a bodybuilder to have strength in your muscles.","I want to lay all my cards out on the table and walk away with no regrets.","Everything happens for a reason - I'm a believer of that for sure.","I played a lot of football, and I was a goalkeeper, but I didn't really like playing in goal.","For a long time, I thought it was all down to dedication, hard work, and visualising doing well - that worked for a bit, but then it stopped. I've realised you have to be more practical and mature to make things actually happen.","Mum is the girliest of them all, but she ended up with me, the tomboy.","I got very addicted to performing. I just want to do that more.","At primary school, it was always me and this other girl, Lauren, who would fight over who was the fastest every year. I was quicker, but for some reason, she always got the glory leg in the relay team. That used to annoy me.","If you saw pictures of me as a kid, you'd laugh because I was always in football kit.","We are all trying to achieve our dreams.","It's getting harder as I get more known. Even though it's my break, I couldn't really go out and get drunk - because people expect you to be training and getting up early. But I'm not bothered about missing out on normal teenage things.","I used to keep injuries to myself. It would just make it worse and worse. Now I'm having none of that.","I feel like, when I'm 100% healthy, I can do anything.","Thankfully, I found athletics. My mum didn't like it at first, but the funny thing is that, now, she's the biggest athletics fan out there. She's a real expert, and she's got all the heptathlon books.","You can be in the shape of your life, and then injury strikes. So you have to grab your opportunities.","In the heptathlon, you can be any shape. Some of the girls are more built than others, and their strong events are the shot put and javelin.","In the lead-up to competitions, I just watch box sets and DVDs and play 'Candy Crush.'","I live with my mum and my nan. I think I will leave eventually, but not at the moment when they look after me so well. If you came to my house, they'd make you eat something.","I want people to tell me the truth.","I want to win medals for myself.","I don't want to be someone else.","I can always go back to education.","I'm very wholehearted. I want to concentrate on one thing in my life at one time.","When there was a fight in school, because I was the tall one, the teachers would say, 'I know you were there. I could see you.'","Maybe I'm the kind of athlete who absorbs the atmosphere instead of trying to block it out.","I think 2020 can still be my time.","I've always looked at 2016, but 2020 is realistic for me. I'll be 23 in 2016, but if I keep on progressing, hopefully 2016 will be a medal chance as well for me.","When it comes to peaking at the right time, I have to thank my coach Mike Holmes: he is a genius.","No one put pressure on me to go to the Olympics; once I'd got the qualifying mark, I just couldn't say no.","I like to balance competing with studying. It's hard work at the moment, but it could be worse.","I'm training once a day, four days a week, and just loving life.","Record-breaking is not getting boring. I am definitely happy with that.","I think everyone in the heptathlon is improving together, so it is a very hard event to compete in.","That people believe I can be Olympic champ, it just spurs me on.","Very few athletes get to experience a home Games, and I don't want to pass up the chance.","Competing in London would be a dream come true.","I'm in awe of any Olympic champion, for sure.","It's a huge step up from the European Indoors to then being a gold medallist at the World Championships.","If something is mine, then I want to keep it.","My granddad used to mind me at weekends, and if the game was on, and you wanted to get across the room, you had to crawl under the TV. So I've always been a Liverpool fan, and meeting Steven Gerrard was massive for me. He knew who I was before we'd even said hello!","I was watching 'Deal or No Deal' on YouTube recently, and I bawled when the contestant won £250,000. I think I just like watching people achieve their dreams.","As an athlete, you have to become quite selfish with your time and your body and your training.","Beijing was a huge slap in the face, and it forced me to look at myself. I have to realise that this is my life.","I should have a better CV, and that's knocked me into believing that I have to grab these opportunities while I can.","I think I rely on my talent more than my brain sometimes.","I have seven disciplines to train for, and so I try to complete them all every week.","An example of my average week would be the gym on Monday; Tuesday will be a technical session. I practice running and high jump on Thursday and then have another technical session at the weekend.","You can exercise anytime, anywhere. It doesn't have to be the gym.","Before training, I eat slow-release energy food, such as porridge or muesli, especially in the morning. Afterwards, I eat protein so my muscles are able to recover, such as a protein bar followed by a meal of chicken and vegetables. I always stay hydrated during workouts by drinking plenty of water throughout.","I can't be disappointed with my first gold in a senior championship, and to score 5000 points, which only one other woman, the world record holder, has got over, I am satisfied.","I just need to concentrate on each event and accumulate a good score, and hopefully I won't flop in the 800 m. in Gotzis.","You can only train three or four hours a day, so what do you do with the other 20 hours?","I've been training quite hard.","It's inspiring for me to know that you've got to step up your game.","I can handle coming fifth as long as I know I've given my all out there and have no regrets.","I always have a book that I write during competition. I need it with me, just to read back and reflect and look forward. If I'm feeling anxious, it helps me.","In 2012, I was over the moon to be there, especially as it was our home Olympics. It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and I just wanted to take everything in.","I am going to Rio with a chance of a medal.","I've got so many big gains to make in the javelin and the shot put. I know I'm not going to be winning the field in those events, but I need to do myself justice.","I always said I wanted an Olympic medal. It's the pinnacle of any athlete's career.","When you see all the medals won by Team GB, you can just see how much it means to each and every athlete, so it just feel like it's a little bit of a missed opportunity - but I'm only 23. I have just got to get on now and keep going.","I've always known that Rio and Tokyo are my two Olympics. Now that Rio hasn't gone to plan, Tokyo has to work, and I'm more motivated than ever.","As a Liverpool fan, I'm an eternal optimist because of what we did in Istanbul in 2005.","It's very easy to run a good 200 m. after an appalling shot put.","It's what happens in other major championships - I just lose my head a little bit.","When I was a kid, I always had my hair in two plaits. But for dancing, I had to have it in a bun because I did ballet.","I used to play football with a load of lads, and I would be like a secret agent going out with a hat on so they wouldn't see my hair in a bun.","As soon as I could talk, I chose shorts to wear.","My goal is definitely a gold medal still in Rio.","There will be mental worries with the long jump before Rio, but I know I can get through it. It's just getting my confidence back. I know I have a big jump in me.","I've always believed in myself, and it's such a long competition over two days, you can't worry about what anyone else is doing.","If I can put it together, I've got an opportunity to win.","Getting rid of all the world records would be a bit of a radical move.","In boxing, it's one fight, so it's easier to build up rivalries, but everyone's got huge respect for each other.","It's impossible in heptathlon to have a proper rivalry - you're spending two days together and seven events and dedicate your life to it. It's like a marathon: two days of mental and physical exhaustion.","I've always followed this page on Instagram called the Sausage Dog Hotel.","You don't not want to beat somebody because you're friends with them.","It's an individual sport; you want to do well for yourself.","Obviously, when you're up against somebody you don't like there's extra motivation, but I don't think any person going for an Olympic gold is going to put friendship first.","I think I've slayed my long jump demons.","I'm going to trust my instincts when something's wrong.","Every international meeting or championship I do, I can cope a lot better because I can say I did the 100 m. hurdles, opened up the athletics at an Olympic Games in front of a home crowd, 80,000 people.","It's crazy because it's a British record and a personal best, but I wanted that 2 m. I cleared the 1.97 m. first attempt with space, so I think I could have done a little better.","The heptathlon is made up of seven events, and people have strengths and weaknesses.","I'm trying my best.","They're just my weaknesses. Everyone is just constantly talking to me about it. It doesn't help.","I actually hated dancing. My mum used to have to bribe me to go by buying me things. A year before I stopped going, I was going to go for an audition with the Royal Ballet. It turned out I was a year too young. Because I was tall, they thought I was older. But before I had the chance to go back, I quit.","My mum was a dancer. She would tour the world with a group, and she had me in a dance class when I was still in a nappy. They told her to come back when I could walk.","I don't do athletics for any other reason than achieving certain distances, certain titles and goals in my head.","This is my job. I just wake up, and I train.","I was one of those girls in class who always had her hair in plaits, was always with the boys, always playing football in the street.","It was just me and my mum growing up, and my mum's always said that's why I'm so mature. We were best friends, and if it wasn't for her, I wouldn't even have started athletics, because she wanted me to have a hobby.","There's a big debate whether pentathlon or heptathlon is harder: five events in one day or seven in two.","It's a huge step up from the European Indoor Championships to being world outdoor gold medallist.","London 2012 was the biggest thing I will probably ever do, but I didn't realise it at the time!","I remember going down the tunnel into the Olympic Stadium and getting a glimpse of all the people and hearing all the noise, all the people shouting for us. I'd seen Usain Bolt on the warm-up track, and then, as I walked into the stadium, I sort of realised how big it was!","For me, I can't see Liverpool without him because he's just been there since I was a kid. I had him on the back of my shirt. He's always been on the team every time I've watched Liverpool. It's going to be really weird next season, a Steven Gerrard-less Liverpool side."],"Katarina Witt":["I can't say, 'It doesn't matter if you win or lose.' It's not true. You go in to win.","Figure skating is a mixture of art and sport.","When you're young, you don't think very far ahead. You just think in terms of the next day, the next week, the next competition. You don't think about injuries that could threaten your long-term health.","Almost nothing is presented to you on a silver platter. You have to really work for it.","Skating taught me to set a goal and to block out other things and just focus on this one thing.","I was the very first athlete in East Germany allowed to go professional.","When I go out on the ice, I just think about my skating. I forget it is a competition.","As an athlete, you choose your sport and are drawn into it but your passion should never be driven by fame and fortune but a desire to create something special that people will always remember.","When I get up, I have a cup of coffee, surf the Internet, then do a half-hour run.","Money was never the motivation. It never should be in sports.","It's hard work to make a four-minute program look effortless and elegant.","Every man prefers to look at a well-shaped woman instead of a rubber ball.","I was an athlete. And I proved I didn't win just because I was pretty. I was good, too.","I never had a serious injury that kept me out of a big competition. Now everyone has injuries - to their feet or their knees or their backs.","When you see the audiences and the smiling faces at the shows it really makes up for the work that you put in. I have a job I really love so whatever hecticness comes up - I'll just deal with it.","I hope that I can maintain my skating as long as possible.","I'm the sort of person who needs a big mountain in front of me to climb.","The desire to really compete again has been there for a long time.","It's not like I didn't do anything for 10 years and chose a new profession. I've been on the ice a lot. I'm not an outsider.","I learned not to depend on other people. I needed support, but it's you who has to go out and deliver.","I never really like to skate in an empty ice rink; I always need the attention of an audience.","I started the class late. The teacher said I would have to learn as much in half a year that the others learned in a year. I did it.","Competitions make me nervous. When I go out on the ice, I just think about my skating and not, 'I have to do this to win.' I forget it is a competition.","When you reach a certain level, you live in a bubble when all you think, dream and breathe is becoming the best athlete in the world.","Sometimes, success almost haunts you. You want to be the best at everything you do and know you have to work hard.","Too many times women try to be competitive with each other. We should help support each other, rather than try to be better than each other.","Sometimes I even now feel like a stranger in my country. But I knew there would be problems because I had seen the world as a skater. And now? A lot of people in eastern Germany have lost jobs, rents went up, food costs went up, unemployment went to 20 percent. Freedom is good, but it is not easy.","I don't want to compete. I want to skate for the joy. I get so nervous in competition. I get always sick. I had pressures enough in my life from skating.","I want to see sunrises in the mountains. You never get to see such things enough in a lifetime. I want to see more."],"Kate Adie":["I keep telling myself to calm down, to take less of an interest in things and not to get so excited, but I still care a lot about liberty, freedom of speech and expression, and fairness in journalism.","I have no time for the endless nostalgia: 'Oh gosh I used to . . . ' Life is too short; I don't have any time for sitting and saying I miss things. What's the point? Go and do something else.","People always seem to assume that we have a full, back-up support team - make-up, costume and a driver - but usually, in a war zone, there's only me and the cameraman.","I was sent to a nice Church of England girls' school and at that time, after university, a woman was expected to become a teacher, a nurse or a missionary - prior to marriage.","No two wars are identical.","I've never been one to sit around and eat my heart out. Life's too short.","I will never retire.","But in the first Gulf war the United Kingdom was not under any threat from Iraq, and is still less so in the second one. Then there is no justification for obstructing freedom of information, particularly as nations have a right to know what their soldiers are being used for.","In any war, there is a concealment of certain kinds of setbacks because it's propaganda for the enemy.","War zones are dangerous, protests can be violent, also, natural disasters are difficult to cover, so there are going to be risks.","There was no equal pay law when I started working. I was no different to any other woman in any other job at the time.","When you are covering a life-or-death struggle, as British reporters were in 1940, it is legitimate and right to go along with military censorship, and in fact in situations like that there wouldn't be any press without the censorship.","Up until about 12 years ago we never, ever, wore flak jacket or helmets but now the nastiness has got worse.","The better the information it has, the better democracy works. Silence and secrecy are never good for it.","On the Northern Ireland question, for instance, the British and Irish governments prohibit media contact with members of the IRA, but we have always gone ahead, believing in the right to information.","Now children as young as nine carry AK47s which can kill 30 people in seconds.","My job is to get to the heart of a story, to find out what's really going on; to get it verified and, then, to get it out to as many people as possible as fast as.","It's totally mistaken to suppose that an armed escort is going to give a journalist any protection - on the contrary, journalists who turn up surrounded by armed personnel are just turning themselves into targets and in even worse danger.","It wasn't glamorous in my day. In the regions, reporters were seen as such low life that they didn't merit their name in the Radio Times. Now people are interested in being famous. I never gave it a thought.","In Sierra Leone last year there was just the two of us hanging out of a helicopter and, when we were in Bosnia, I drove an armoured vehicle, thousands of miles.","If I'm in danger then it's usually my fault and it's up to me to get myself out of it. I am not in it just to get an adrenalin rush. No way!","I wrote in the book very specifically what I wanted to write about, period, and left it at.","I was timid and frightened as a child. Yours truly did not shin up mountains or do any other kind of adventurous stuff.","I sailed through my childhood with a complete lack of any drama.","I have nothing to do with the selection of stories. I'm the reporter.","I have never been attracted to any kind of violence.","I don't want to be involved in endless media gossip.","I don't sit there and speculate. I'm not that sort of person. It wastes time, actually.","I also read modern novels - I have just had to read 60 as I am one of the judges for the Orange Fiction Prize.","Hair is also a problem. I remember once, when I was reporting from Beirut at the height of the civil war, someone wrote in to the BBC complaining about my appearance.","Beslan, where the Russian authorities stopped live coverage of the school being stormed, was an illustration of the progress we still have to make.","Twenty-four hour news delivers people who stand and talk to camera rather than deliver reported packages with their own camera crew where it's happening.","On the whole, when the unexpected danger happens to you, you're thinking so fast, you're thinking so hard, every bit of you is alive to 'What should I do?' 'What can I do?' There isn't a lot of time for contemplation.","I never desired to go into war zones. I never had any thought about it. It sort of just happened as part of the job.","I don't find an advantage or disadvantage in being a woman when reporting. What little advantages there might be in some instances is cancelled out by the basic lack of lavatories round the world for women."],"Kate Ashfield":["I always wanted to be a doctor and go to art school, but I thought I'd regret it if I didn't act.","Some people say to be an actor you've got to die to do it. I think it's healthy if you think, 'I'll do it if it works, and if I don't, I can do something else.' That way seems to work for me.","I find celebrity really scary.","I am really easy to scare, and I don't enjoy watching spooky films.","Working in Birmingham for the first time was the best thing, especially as it was round the corner from my mum's house in Harborne!"],"Kate Atkinson":["Ethics are not necessarily to do with being law-abiding. I am very interested in the moral path, doing the right thing.","The legacy of the fairy story in my brain is that everything will work out. In fiction it would be very hard for me, as a writer, to give a bad ending to a good character, or give a good ending to a bad character. That's probably not a very postmodern thing to say.","I think you have to learn for yourself how to write. I'm slightly mystified by creative writing courses - God love them - because I can't understand how you can explain a process that I find so baffling.","When I'm writing, my neural pathways get blocked. I can't read. I can barely hold a conversation without forgetting words and names. I wish I could wear the same clothes and eat the same food each day.","I spent four years doing a doctorate in postmodern American literature. I can recognize it when I see it.","A novel and its writer are inseparable: you are your books. A play's not like that at all. 'Abandonment's not mine - it's everyone's. I wanted it to be a co-operative thing because I was tired of that anal control that I have over novels.","I don't have goals when writing books, apart from getting to the end. I have rather vague ideas about how I want things to feel, I'm big on ambience. I have a title, a beginning and a probable ending and go from there.","Not being published would be great. When I say that to other writers they look at me as if I'm totally insane.","My work is not my life. I started writing quite late, I didn't have that 'writing is everything, my art is all.' You have to be able to recognise the difference between the two.","Probably not needing to be published would give me more time to think about a book.","It's been said that the men in my books have been absent, or weak, or creepy.","I've always loved mysteries, the something there that you didn't know, and with 'Case Histories' I just decide to make that more up-front.","The great thing about writing compared to life is getting to tie things up.","I don't want to spoil the magic, but it's a very curious thing that honestly baffles me. It's the nearest we'll ever get to playing God, to suddenly produce these fully formed creatures. It is a bit odd. Other aspects you work out more - you rework sentences, you rework imagery. But not characters.","Without siblings you get quite a skewed vision of yourself and of the world. I always felt I didn't understand how it worked. I remember feeling quite lonely.","My father was an autodidact. It wasn't a middle-class house. Shopkeepers are aspirant. He paid for me to go to private school. He was denied an education - he had a horrible childhood. He got a place at a grammar school and wasn't allowed to go.","Everyone said, 'Well, you're very old for a first novel,' and I said, 'How do you write when you haven't lived? How do you write when you have no experience? How do you write straight out of university?'","I usually start writing a novel that I then abandon. When I say abandon, I don't think any writer ever abandons anything that they regard as even a half-good sentence. So you recycle. I mean, I can hang on to a sentence for several years and then put it into a book that's completely different from the one it started in.","I think about death a lot, I really do, because I can't believe I won't exist. It's the ego isn't it? I feel that I should retreat into a better form of Zen Buddhism than this kind of ego-dominated thing. But I don't know, I mean, I want to come back as a tree but I suspect that it's just not going to happen, is it?","I did feel when my mother died if anyone was going to haunt me it would be her. And she hasn't, so I think it is possibly the end.","But I, you know, if I could choose a period to go back to, I think I would like to live through the Blitz. 'Cause you do read so many accounts of people saying they're living their lives at such an intense pitch that it was a completely different way of living.","Because I've a track record of talking about books I never write, in Australia they think I'm about to write a book about Jane Austen. Something I said at some festival.","Certainly I had a really terrible time with 'Emotionally Weird.' When I finished it, I thought, 'I can't write any more.'","I was an only child and grew up in York where my parents ran a surgical supplies shop. When I say I wish I had brothers and sisters, friends say it's not what it's cracked up to be, but I think it must be good to have someone who knew you from the beginning.","Fairy tales opened up a door into my imagination - they don't conform to the reality that's around you as a child. I started reading when I was three and read everything, but I wanted to be an actress.","It was failing part of my Ph.D. that led me into novel-writing. By then I was 29, had remarried and had a second baby. It struck me that I'd lost my path in life and I felt frustrated. That's when I started to write.","I had a novel in the back of my mind when I won an Ian St James story competition in 1993. At the award ceremony an agent asked me if I was writing a novel. I showed her four or five chapters of what would become 'Behind the Scenes at the Museum' and to my surprise she auctioned them off.","Because I write fiction, I don't write autobiography, and to me they are very different things. The first-person narrative is a very intimate thing, but you are not addressing other people as 'I' - you are inhabiting that 'I.'","I can't imagine what it would be like to write in a relaxed state. I'm going to be writing some stories for my own interest. I want to experiment with different things and see if I can approach writing with much less control and in a better psychological state. It will be like breaking out of a straitjacket.","Life is a very orderly thing, but in fiction there is a huge liberation and freedom. I can do what I like. There's nothing that says I can't write a page of full stops. There is no 'should' involved, although you wouldn't know that from literary reviews and critics.","'Feminism' is such an incredibly awkward word for us these days, isn't it? Not to be feminist would be bizarre, wouldn't it?","Alternate history fascinates me, as it fascinates all novelists, because 'What if?' is the big thing.","When I started 'Case Histories,' the characters were all going to Antarctica on a cruise. The first part was called 'Embarkation.' It was supposed to be about everyone preparing to embark on the cruise, but it mushroomed into an entire book.","Writing for me is quite a plastic form, a kind of mental sculpture, although that sounds weird. It acquires its character and its depth as it goes along.","The cult of the individual is killing us. I think Twitter signals the death of western civilisation, but people have been saying that since Demosthenes.","My highest point was the first thing I won, a short story competition in a women's magazine in the Eighties. It was the first time I'd had my writing validated, and the first thing I'd ever shown anyone else.","I need to be very isolated to write, and unfortunately isolation is often quite difficult to find. My ideal writing environment would be a country house hotel in the middle of nowhere, with full room service.","Like many writers, I started by writing short stories. I needed to learn how to write and stories are the most practical way to do this, and less soul-destroying than working your way through a lengthy novel and then discovering it's rubbish.","If you don't have a unique voice, then you're not really a writer.","I find the past so fascinating. Photographs are strange, almost surreal, almost here yet gone. I slip into thinking what the past must have been like and I enjoy creating that ambience and atmosphere - 1730 to around 1870 is the most interesting period."],"Kate Baldwin":["If no one's doing the creative work that you want to do, do it yourself.","No one will die because of bad acting. No one will die because you missed a cue. We're all human beings. If mistakes are made, you figure out that you're going to live.","Fiorello LaGuardia saved City Center. The real man saved it, and he made this building into a performing arts venue.","I really trust Susan Stroman. I really think she knows what she's doing. I really trust Andrew Lippa and John August. I think they have proven themselves over and over again and know what to do, and they have the big picture in mind.","Even with revivals, I don't really pay attention to previous incarnations. I always just go with the script and with the director and am willing to treat it as brand new.","I have to start with elements of myself, which is what you always do as an actor.","'Encores!' is, to me, a wonderful, warm, welcoming place, and I hope it always will be.","Michael John's music is soul-stirring. It gets inside the deepest part of you; it's almost a chemical reaction.","I certainly have played women who have a pioneer spirit and longing for adventure.","To create something new is both thrilling and excruciating at the same time. It's great to have all these choices in front of you, and to have the writers in the room so you know exactly what they meant. But the downside is you want so badly not to screw it up!"],"Kate Beckinsale":["I can't tell you how many times I've gone to present at the Golden Globes, come home, whipped the dress off and read to my daughter wearing gazillion-dollar earrings. That's how it goes in my house, and I wouldn't have it any other way.","I think I like playing the bad girl. I like complicated. I like flawed, messed up complicated. It's more interesting.","If someone had told me years ago that sharing a sense of humour was so vital to partnerships, I could have avoided a lot of sex!","I have to say, sushi freaks me out more than almost anything.","I try and take lots of vitamins and I don't drink. I do smoke, though, I'd be insufferable if I didn't smoke, you'd have to push me off a balcony I'd be so boring.","With every project you do, you bring out a part of yourself, and it seems to be quite a good way of expanding a person.","I'm attracted to playing things that I find difficult, just because it's a journey that is much more interesting.","No one is more enslaved than a slave who doesn't think they're enslaved.","I don't tend to do much with my lips. My lips are naturally very pink, so if I add any more colour, it looks like I've been smacked in the mouth!","I always felt that anorexia was the form of breakdown most readily available to adolescent girls.","I have more pet peeves than anybody: people talking in the movie theater, people eating in the movie theater loudly, people being rude, people making noise when you're supposed to be asleep, like drilling noises outside. I could be here all day.","When I was pregnant, I had the romantic idea that after the baby was born I would not only take up reading in earnest again, but also write a novel while my daughter slept in her Moses basket. Of course, I barely had time to keep up with my magazines until she started sleeping properly.","If I get a script that's set in the jungle it goes to the bottom of the pile because I don't think the playgrounds are going to be very good there! I'm really aware of how lucky I am but I have the kind of job where I can bring my child to work.","It's a very difficult thing losing a parent, but I think there's an added complication for me, because he was so well-loved and he had this very open charm that made people feel they had a personal relationship with him.","As a mother, you feel much more vulnerable. And when you're vulnerable, you're a much better actress.","Everybody likes the underdog, because everybody feels like the underdog. No matter how successful you are, you always think, 'No one's being nice enough to me!'","If I ever have sex with someone I might be able to develop a sense of humor.","I didn't go looking to marry an American, it just kinda happened like that.","Apparently, I get facials and manicures all the time. I read this and think, 'Oh, I wish I did that!' I don't think I've had a facial since I was 19.","Given that I can't sing like Freddie Mercury, obviously I'm not going to pursue it as a career. What would be the point?","I'm glad I've never been so successful that I couldn't stop doing one thing. I've kind of been able to just kick it along and switch around.","I feel like I've done a bunch of period stuff and then a bunch of romantic comedies.","I feel like I'm really lucky.","I'm a fan of action movies.","I think what's dangerous about being an actor who does action movies is you think, 'Well, I can totally handle myself now.' But if my opponent didn't know the other half of the routine, I don't know how well I'd do.","I didn't feel very attractive as a child and actually I wasn't.","I think that dwelling on other people's perception of you is the road to complete madness, unfortunately. I try and resist that.","I feel like I flunked at adolescence really badly. I found it really difficult.","I grew up as an only child and my mother was also an only child, so we were both very passionate about reading. I think I passed that on to my daughter, who went plowing through 'Harry Potter' and every other book possible!","I feel like my brain is more geared towards a novel than it is to a movie.","The secret to everything for me is doing yoga every day. It does do nice things for your body, but it also kind of calms you down and chills you out. Other than that, I don't really drink alcohol and I always take my makeup off at night!","There's such a pressure on women that we put on ourselves and everyone else puts on us to look unrealistic and everything, but you just can't compare yourself to people in magazines.","Job-wise, I did have a moment of panic that I should have been a doctor a few years ago, but I hate when people vomit.","Obviously I've had great experiences with people I've worked with on films - I've married half of them! I should come with a warning sign that says, 'Don't worry, I'm not going to try to marry you. I'm done.'","This is what's sick about living in L.A. My eight-year-old daughter will point to a woman and say, 'Look! That woman's had too much Botox.' She spots them because they all look a bit like Lord Voldemort from 'Harry Potter.'","What's considered ideal in Hollywood is completely different than anywhere else in the world. I don't think you can aspire to it, nor can I. Everybody is retouched, stretched, lengthened, slimmed and trimmed. I could look at a picture of myself from the past and think, 'Why don't I look like that now?' It's because I never have!","When I first started working, I was very aware of the fact that I'd been to university and studied Russian and French and not acting. So when I started working, I'd started working quite young, I felt like it was important to treat myself kind of like an apprentice and do as many different types of things as I could.","I would quite like to play a big concert as Freddie Mercury. I can't sing that great and I haven't yet found a use for the over large size of my teeth. I quite fancy a mustache like that and he was such a great showman.","I would say probably my least favorite costume ever was in 'Van Helsing.' That was a huge pain because it had thigh-high boots with 30 buckles on them that had to be done up individually.","Apparently, I'm very good at firing a gun without blinking, which is unusual. That's why so many action characters have to wear sunglasses during shoot-out scenes. That's my party trick.","I don't have a big career plan. I just like to see how things come out, and I just try to keep going in different directions.","Were I not married to the director, I'm not sure I'd know anything about the 'Underworld' sequel.","Someone once said that you can make the choice between getting old and getting creepy, and I think getting old is the way to go.","No one really knows who I am or where I came from in America, and there's something quite nice about that.","I find a lot of things kind of funny and I often say what's on my mind, and then get nine texts from all my friends going, 'What's the matter with you?' But I haven't ever made a big attempt to have any particular image. And I don't really worry about it. If it's funny, I don't care.","I don't really watch all that much television, I have to say, because I'm so intimidated by how many channels there are. I really cannot find my way back to anything. But I'm compulsively addicted to '24.' I love that show.","I love my fan base because they never high-five me; they always get really shifty and hide. Adam Sandler's fan base are like, 'Hey!' and high-five him and want to hang out, but mine go behind pillars and get really freaked out.","I dropped out of Oxford, and now I only speak Russian with the woman who gives me a bikini-wax. See what Hollywood does to you?","I was a very difficult child, and the time I spent reading was about the only peace I gave my mother.","At Oxford University, I studied languages so I could read the great novels as they were originally written. I took what in the United States would be a double major in Russian and French, but I have to admit that the pressure of getting through so many books spoiled reading for me.","Books have always helped me make sense of things. With any life experience, you can find someone who has documented it in a poetic way."],"Kate Bernheimer":["When I first read Anne Frank's 'Diary of a Young Girl,' I saw for the first time that a girl could be a writer and that it had something to do with survival and with ethics and fighting against evil. I admired her, though her diary remained terrifying and mysterious to me. She was a character in a real fairy tale - fairy tales are brutal.","Books are no different from goats! They enjoy an afternoon out on the lawn.","In the old fairy tales, often a 'moral' was tacked on at the end of the story - say, if a book was going to be marketed to young readers. And the morals don't really suit the stories at all, which makes them super weird - part of why I love the tradition so much. I do play with this, though I am more concerned with ethics than morals.","With our evolved busy hands and our evolved busy brains, in an extraordinarily short period of time we've managed to alter the earth with such geologic-forcing effects that we ourselves are forces of nature. Climate change, ocean acidification, the sixth mass extinction of species.","When I wrote the eight fairy tales that appear in 'Horse, Flower, Bird' I was working toward a completely new form of artistic expression, trying to create a new kind of tale that also felt vintage: innocent and childlike, but haunted. I tried to write a picture-less picture book.","Well documented, the relationship of literature to myth in the Western world has undergone much change over the millennia, as first the age of gods fell away before the notion of a single god, and then, for many people, that single god slipped away, too.","People tend to think of fairy tales as 'archetypal.' They are also extremely sensual, something which translates well over the ages.","There are recurring elements in popularized fairy tales, such as absent parents, some sort of struggle, a transformation, and a marriage. If you look at a range of stories, you find many stories about marriage, sexual initiation, abandonment. The plots often revolve around what to me seem to be elemental fears and desires.","I often visit Maria Tatar's 'The Grimm Reader' for a cold dose of courage. Her translations come from the Brothers Grimm, whose now-famous collection of 'Kinder- und Hausmarchen' ('Children's and Household Tales') was first published in 1812. The book was not intended for young readers.","I have been writing fairy tales for as long as I can remember. Not much has changed in terms of my natural attraction to the narrative techniques of fairy tales. My appreciation of them in the traditional stories has deepened, especially of flat and unadorned language, intuitive logic, abstraction, and everyday magic.","It wasn't until I was an adult reader that I began to fathom the influence of fairy tales on writers I was in love with over the years, from Louisa May Alcott to Bernard Malamud to John Cheever to Anne Frank to Joy Williams.","As I read more and more fairy tales as an adult, I found massive collusion between their 'subjects' and those in my fiction: childhood, nature, sexuality, transformation. I realized that it wasn't by accident that I was drawn to their narrative structure and motifs.","Sometimes, violent details have been eliminated from fairy tales simply because they were deemed too graphic. So one does not, at the end of Disney's version of 'Cinderella,' see the stepsisters' eyes get pecked and pecked by doves, because Disney wanted to market the story for wholesome family viewing.","As a reader, coming to my reading as a writer immersed in fairytales, I can't help but notice in so many stories, plays, poems that I read, the sort of breadcrumbs of fairytale techniques, so I'm very excited when I notice that.","As scientists have discovered - or perhaps explained is a better word, or perhaps identified - we now live in the age of the Anthropocene. The geologic age of the Anthropocene. Those high priests of material evidence have given us our own epoch like the Holocene, the Pleistocene! Apparently we now, it seems, have superhuman powers.","When humans become gods, when our wings grow so great as to beat about the very edges of the earth, no one can answer but us.","I think pink is one of the saddest colors in the world, and many American humans are taught not to take anything pink seriously, which is weird.","I love the idea of the 'vignette,' which is associated with the decorative, illustrative, small, and thus with the feminine, and thus easily maligned. I mean, Emily Dickinson wrote vignettes, right?"],"Kate Bosworth":["It's so different when you change your hair color, you're treated so differently. It's a very funny experience. It's fun - I love changing up my hair.","I wasn't a social butterfly at all.","Whenever I hear that I'm on the brink of stardom, I feel like I want to run into a cave.","I felt uncomfortable in cliques.","It's sort of interesting how, when you get older, things that were once so important sort of fall away.","That's the funniest thing about portraying certain things on screen, sitting next to your parents and they get to see this glimpse of me kissing another guy.","Acting is a life experience. I'm always learning things when I'm making a movie. So the fame part of it is fine when you consider what you get out of this job.","You promote your films; it's part of your job. You do the magazine covers and stuff, and then I try to live a really normal life. I definitely don't try to make it into any more craziness than it is.","I keep everything that's private private.","You never grow out of high school sadly.","In this business, it's easy for either your heart or your head to be swayed, and I try to always stay true to who I am.","I was a real loner in high school, even though people assume I was the head cheerleader.","My head was always in books.","At the time, when you're being dissected and judged it's pretty brutal, but in hindsight it's great and - it sounds cliched - you do come out the other side better and stronger.","Look, some people talk about their personal lives a lot; I try not to, unless it's more of a generality.","I don't want to broadcast my personal life because I feel it's off-putting.","I really wanted to go to high school and be normal.","I'm a serial monogamist.","I can't deal with someone flashy. That's so not me.","I like somebody who's not so crazy but likes to have a good time... and who is thoughtful and kind and easy to laugh with. Somebody you can just be yourself with one hundred and fifty percent.","I almost envy people who say whatever they want.","You have to have confidence. You can't be someone who's so insecure that she's a basket case.","I grew up in a small town where everyone wanted to be the same or look the same and was afraid to be different.","My parents were amazing and wonderful, but there was a lot of pressure to do my best and in every way possible.","I hold theatre acting in such high esteem that it scares me.","You know what, I'm a big coward and I'm really afraid of live audiences.","I used to really want to go on the stage and then the last couple of years I've done some presenting at some award shows. I was so nervous I thought I was going to be sick, so I don't think me on stage for any length of time would work too well.","I just think that people take me a little more seriously as a brunette. I don't know if that's just because of a societal preconceived notion that all blondes are stupid, but it's a different kind of attitude.","I really like one-on-one, rich relationships.","I'm very independent.","The fashion world feels more normal to me when I'm with them.","I actually hate shopping.","To put as little pressure on the relationship you're in is very important.","The fact that I'm very close with my past relationships is something I pride myself on. My mom is still close to her first husband. It's nice to be able to enjoy someone in a different form.","I don't really get star-struck, but I do get talent struck. If I meet somebody that I think is just wildly talented and brilliant, that's when I start getting nervous."],"Kate Braverman":["Falling in love with landscapes is what L.A. women do. It doesn't necessarily imply betrothal or marriage.","As a citizen of the post-historical variety, I am in continual mourning and prepared for worse.","I have a great ability to improvise verbally, and I am very funny on a dime.","I'm manic-depressive, technically bi-polar II with many borderline features.","I've written books as acts of discovery: things I need to know and that I need to touch. And it's very dangerous work to deal with the most toxic internal elements... I feel like Madame Curie at my computer. I feel like I should be hemorrhaging from my eyes and ears.","If you can be anything else but a writer, be it.","There's a bizarre prejudice that exists in the New York publishing establishment that any work outside the tri-state area is being done by trained chimpanzees, that geography screens out sensibility. There's an idea that all Los Angeles writing is about the movie industry, that it's vulgar, shallow and banal.","Unfortunately, the more chaotic the society, the greater is the desire for conservative, nonconfrontational art.","Male critics and men in the publishing industry want from their women writers what they want from their wives. I'm interested in presenting characters that are more challenging, threatening, complicated and unpredictable.","I find women as writers and as characters are operating within narrow confines. They inherit a kind of ghetto of the soul. I'm trying to enlarge the spectrum.","You don't just leave Los Angeles. Such a departure requires magical intervention. You can't simply purchase a ticket to another destination. You must disappear."],"Kate Brown":["As educators and policy makers, it is important to demonstrate for parents the connection between high levels of student participation in assessment and system accountability - ensuring the success of every student.","No individual, regardless of where they live or whom they love, should suffer discrimination.","Water is the foundation for our economies, communities, ecosystems, and quality of life.","We need to quit arguing about whether the glass is half full or half empty - and instead acknowledge that there's not quite enough water to go around.","Any threat to the health and safety of a child in any school or classroom is unacceptable.","Public health and safety are my highest priorities.","High-quality public education - combined with other appropriate support, as needed - is the best way to achieve the Oregon Business Plan's goal of reducing the number of people living in poverty.","I have spent my career fighting to make Oregon a place where everyone can thrive.","My personal view is that I am opposed to the death penalty.","Oregonians expect the state to prioritize the health and well-being of them and their families.","We want our students to graduate from high school, but we want them to graduate with a plan, whether it's college or career.","Cities around the United States do not have land use planning like we have in Oregon, and they are all struggling with issues like affordable housing.","Most public officials work hard to serve the public good and abide by Oregon's ethics laws.","I pledge to you today that for as long as I am your governor, I will not seek or accept any outside compensation from any source.","I certainly think it's really important that folks in the metropolitan area be able to meet the increased cost of living.","It's really important that folks be able to speak out.","Oregonians continually demonstrate a strong belief in fairness and equal treatment under the law.","I know what it feels like to be a victim of domestic violence.","I know what it feels like to represent clients who can't get restraining orders on abusive partners.","I grew up in a middle-class family. I went to law school.","I know what it feels like to be paid less - substantially less - than the male lawyer in the office next to me.","I seek solutions, not battles.","I think the bottom line for Oregonians is that cleaner fuels mean cleaner air, and we need that, and we want that.","The record shows that I've kept a very steady hand on the helm throughout some enormous challenges.","John Kitzhaber was a visionary leader for Oregon.","The challenge is sort of capturing the issues that Oregonians feel strongly about and moving forward on those.","My highest priority is the safety of all Oregonians and their communities.","I realized I could make a difference. I could be their voice; I could fight for them... There's no better place to fight for working families than the governor's chair.","If I can save one kid's life, for me, it's absolutely worth it.","I'm really pragmatic. That's my reality.","Most of my time as a legislator, I served in the minority. So I'm used to getting the heel of a loaf of bread.","Anytime you do something in this arena, whether it's public records or ethics, it's not like throwing a stone in a quiet pond. It's like throwing a boulder.","The Department of Energy is a critical component of our efforts to curtail climate change; that work will be less effective unless we collaboratively rebuild confidence in the agency and its programs.","I'm very committed to stable and adequate funding for education.","My priorities are making sure we reduce class size and close the achievement gap.","I love working the legislative process.","For me, clean fuels translates into cleaner air for Oregonians. I think that's a good thing.","Oregonians have many good reasons to be proud of our election system.","Before swearing in new citizens, immigration officials check to make sure prospective citizens weren't on voter rolls or voted before achieving legal citizenship. A citizenship petition can be denied if they were.","We deploy a full arsenal of tools against voter fraud, including long prison terms, heavy fines and deportation. We have checks and balances at all levels of the system. And we have the Department of Justice prosecutors backing us up.","As chief elections officer, it's my job to protect the integrity of the ballot.","Every child has a right to learn in an environment that is safe.","I am very concerned that federal and state air quality programs do not consider public health in regulating certain classes of industrial air emissions.","Economic growth is important. But we cannot count on economic growth alone to fund the public education system our children need and deserve.","Imagine trying to learn without a dry place to sleep, eat, and do homework. Children cannot succeed in school if their lives out of school are in total chaos.","Rent and the cost of essentials like food and child care are rising so fast that wages are not keeping up.","We need more partnerships like Vigor Industrial and Portland Community College where men and women in search of a career can get the training they need to get hired right out of school.","We need a more strategic, coordinated, statewide plan that identifies high-demand jobs or industries with a projected under-supply and offer training to get these Oregonians to work.","Under HB 2655, the state is responsible to ensure parents are aware of the purpose and value of assessments and receive notice from their local school districts about their rights and obligations. Educators must engage with parents about the value of assessment and the potential consequences if parents opt out and student participation diminishes.","It's absolutely critical that we not only provide support from cradle to career in the education system but also the wraparound services.","We are like petri dishes, where we can innovate, but we want to do it carefully and thoughtfully.","Tackling affordable housing via land use planning won't necessarily solve the problem.","I'm committed to the goal of Senate Bill 324, and that is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.","The chaos and confusion during the waning days of the Kitzhaber administration, as well as the ensuing federal investigations into allegations of misconduct, caused Oregonians to question their faith in their governor and state government.","When I became governor, I vowed to restore the public's trust.","State government's efforts to address climate change must include reduced consumption and other conservation measures as water shortages become the new normal."],"Kate Burton":["'Beauty Queen' is the weirdest, strangest, and most perfect play to do before 'Hedda Gabler', because there are so many similar issues for Maureen and Hedda. I had played leading ladies before but couldn't really hook into them. After 'An American Daughter' and 'Beauty Queen', I had all the ballast.","I recurred on 'Grey's Anatomy' for three years, and at the same time, I recurred for eight episodes on 'Rescue Me'. And I'd recurred for nine episodes on 'The Practice'. Frankly, the guest star is often the most compelling character.","For me, hour-long drama was always the thing I felt the most comfortable doing, and I've played so many dramatic roles in the theater.","I made a very concerted decision to go to drama school in the United States. But I did have the opportunity to go to Britain's Central School of Speech and Drama, and my dad and I had a few tense words about that. He wanted me to go to British drama school.","I grew up with the one of the most famous fathers in the world in the 1960s and '70s. He passed away in 1984, and as time went on, people didn't know him. That blew me away.","I know from growing up in the spotlight, as it were, that the most important thing is your family.","It ultimately becomes an asset to be part of a theatrical family if, indeed, you're good at what you do.","I was lucky enough to be able to grow and mature in a natural way as an actress.","I have literally played the most interesting parts since I turned 40.","I have a tendency as an actress in general to ground my characters. Even when doing outlandish characters, that's my instinct."],"Kate Bush":["I think snow is so evocative and has such a powerful atmosphere.","I was aware of a lot of my friends being into things I wasn't into. Like sarcasm. It had never been a part of my family - they still don't use sarcasm.","People ask what I really did in the three years between 'The Dreaming' and 'Hounds of Love.' I spent it with my family, living a normal home life.","That's what all art's about - a sense of moving away from boundaries that you can't in real life. Like a dancer is always trying to fly, really - to do something that's just not possible. But you try to do as much as you can within those physical boundaries.","Albums are like diaries. You go through phases, technically and emotionally, and they reflect the state that you're in at the time.","I think quotes are very dangerous things.","The great thing about vinyl is that if you wanted to get a decent-sounding cut, you could really only have 20 minutes max on each side.","I'm the shyest megalomaniac you're ever likely to meet.","Sometimes when I'm going to the supermarket to get the coffee and cat litter, I get freaked out and see all these people staring, and you turn around and there's, like, 40 people all looking at you... and when you go around the corner, they're all following you! You start freaking out like a trapped animal.","School was a very cruel environment, and I was a loner. But I learnt to get hurt, and I learnt to cope with it.","The music industry is in such poor shape; it's in a really bad way, and a lot of people in the industry are very depressed.","I think it's important that things are flawed.","It's so important to me to do the washing, do the Hoovering. I don't ever want to lose contact with that.","My life and my work are very interlocked. That's partly why I like to keep my private life private.","I used to enjoy bad television, like really bad quiz programmes or sitcoms.","What I've tended to do is to use my own experiences to get into someone else's mind, like in Wuthering Heights.","I've read a couple of things that I was sort of close to having a nervous breakdown. But I don't think I was. I was very, very tired. It was a really difficult time.","I don't aim for perfection. But I do want to try and come up with something interesting.","My parents weren't keen on the giving up of school at the beginning to go into singing and dancing, but once they saw I was serious about it, they gave support. I was quite stubborn about my decision, and in the end, they realised it was for the best.","I don't really see myself as a celebrity, but more as a sort of mitre.","It's so fascinating to think about how each snowflake is completely individual - there are millions and millions of them, but each one is so unique.","I think it's almost a law of nature that there are only certain things that hit an emotive space, and that's what was always special for me about music: it made me feel something.","As we become this one global culture, in some ways it's things like the weather and nature that still hold our culture as unique to where we are.","In your teens, you get the physical puberty, and between 28 and 32, mental puberty. It does make you feel differently.","When your mother dies, you're not a little girl any more.","My friends sometimes used to ignore me completely, and that would really upset me badly.","I wasn't an easy, happy-go-lucky girl because I used to think about everything so much, and I think I probably still do.","Thanks to everyone who's encouraged and supported my work over the years.","The more I got into presenting things to the world, the further it was taking me away from what I was, which was someone who just used to sit quietly at a piano and sing and play. It became very important to me not to lose sight of that.","My first Top of the Pops I didn't want to do. I was terrified. I'd never done television before. Seeing the video afterwards was like watching myself die.","It's not important to me that people understand me.","I had friends but I was spending a great deal of my time alone and for me that was vital because there's an awful lot you learn about yourself when you're alone.","But I don't have a very good track record with royalty. My dress fell off in front of Prince Charles at the Prince's Trust, so I'm just living up to my reputation.","I think probably the only thing that is around in these songs is that I was really lonely when I wrote a lot of them. But it was really by my own choosing because I was devoting myself to songwriting and dancing and I wasn't really going out and seeing people.","For me, having a child is a really great responsibility because you've got something there that is depending on you for information and love until a certain age when it goes to school.","For the last 12 years, I've felt really privileged to be living such a normal life. It's so a part of who I am.","Clothes are such a strong part of who a human being is.","There is a figure that is adored, but I'd question very strongly that it's me.","I suppose I do think I go out of my way to be a very normal person, and I just find it frustrating that people think that I'm some kind of weirdo reclusive that never comes out into the world.","I'm a very strong person, and I think that's why, actually, I find it really infuriating when I read, 'She had a nervous breakdown' or 'She's not very mentally stable, just a weak, frail little creature.'","If I could make albums quicker, I'd be on a roll wouldn't I? Everything just seems to take so much time. I don't know why. Time... evaporates.","I don't listen to my old stuff very often at all.","One of the main reasons for wanting to perform live again was to have contact with that audience.","I'll always be tough on myself.","There's always ideas buzzing around, but it's whether they actually end up materialising into a song.","I definitely don't think of myself as being an influence.","I work in a very contained environment, usually.","It's not my ambition to be a big star.","The freedom you feel when you're actually in control of your own music is fantastic.","Writing, film, sculpture, music: it's all make-believe, really.","I could find faults with all my albums because that's just a part of being an artist - it's hard being a human being, isn't it?","I didn't really feel that there were any filler tracks on 'The Red Shoes,' but if I were to do that album now, I wouldn't make it so long.","I hear odd tracks from my albums every now and again on the radio, or maybe a friend plays me something.","People said I couldn't gig, and I proved them wrong.","Originally, when I wrote the song 'The Sensual World' I had used text from the end of 'Ulysses.' When I asked for permission to use the text, I was refused, which was disappointing.","I think that there's always room for humour in music. It's something that always takes itself so seriously, which I think is a bit of a shame.","I think we all feel geeky at times, don't we? Isn't that all a part of the wonderful tapestry of life?","Since I was 17, I had been just making records and promoting them.","I have a little boy, and I wanted to spend a lot of time with him.","I do have the odd dream where I'm on stage and I've completely forgotten what I'm meant to be performing - so they are more nightmares than dreams.","I am just trying to be a good, protective mother. I want to give Bertie as normal a childhood as possible while preserving his privacy.","I don't know about hiding away, but I really only like to present myself when I'm working on something - it's more my work I like to present to the world rather than myself.","It's not that I don't like American pop; I'm a huge admirer of it, but I think my roots came from a very English and Irish base. Is it all sort of totally non-American sounding, do you think?","I think I was just lucky to be brought up in a very musical family. My two older brothers were, and still are, very musical and very creative, and music was a big part of my life from a very young age, so it is quite natural for me to become involved in music in the way that I did.","My father was always playing the piano. He played all kinds of music - Gershwin, all kinds of stuff.","I guess what all artists want is for their work to touch someone or for it to be thought provoking.","I want to be in a position where I can function as a human being.","Gene Wilder is so funny.","When I was signed, that was before the punk thing even happened.","I really love Hitchcock; I think he was a complete genius, to me one of the best directors. Such a sense of how to put things together.","I listen to very little music, particularly contemporary. If I listen to it, it's going to be my own music, some arrangement or something. I spend so much time listening that the way I relax is by watching things, a comedy; that's my way to wind down.","We have such little mystery in our lives generally because of how we live now. I mean, of course, mystery is all around us, but the way we live our lives now, we're too busy to be bothered with it.","If you believe in what you do and you really want to be in music, just stick at it. It's always a learning process. Enjoy it because I think making music is a privilege, really. In an ideal world, it should also always be fun. As much as possible, make it fun.","Quite understandably, people think that if there's a six-year gap or whatever, that it's taken me six years to make the album. It's not really like that at all.","I have to say I find it totally astounding that my albums do as well as they do. It's quite extraordinary, and it's actually very touching for me for the albums to be received with such warmth.","People weren't even aware that I wrote my own songs. The media just promoted me as a female body. It's like I've had to prove that I'm an artist.","I'm not sure there are a lot of things I'd want a manager for. I suppose I feel that at least the decisions I make are coming from me, and I'm not put into a situation that I wouldn't want to be in.","Touring is an incredibly isolated situation. I don't know how people tour for years on end. You find a lot of people who can't stop touring, and it's because they don't know how to come back into life. It's sort of unreal.","Obviously I try to make the best music that I can, but after about two years of making an album, you start to worry: 'Is it going to come out all right? Is it all going to sound churned out?'","Whenever I see the news, it's always the same depressing things.","I don't read newspapers, and I've said I don't watch the news. I love books, but I don't read much. What I do is I get people to read to me, and I put the stories in my head.","I don't get out to parties often.","I am just a quiet reclusive person who has managed to hang around for a while.","I had an incredibly full life with my imagination: I used to have all sorts of trolls and things; I had a wonderful world around my toys and invented people. I don't mean I had imaginary friends; I just had this big imagination thing going on. I didn't need any imaginary friends, because I had so much other stuff going on.","In a popular medium, you're going to get loads of stuff that is trite, but there'll also be some really special moments.","I love being a mother. I think it's the best thing I've ever done, and I personally feel that it's had a very positive effect on my work. I think it's an encouraging force for creativity, it feeds creativity - it did for me, certainly.","I have a theory that there are still parts of our mental worlds that are still based around the age of between five and eight, and we just kind of pretend to be grown-up.","I was writing from the age of 10, and I was never really into going to discos and dances and stuff. I never told anyone at school that I did that because I feared it would alienate me even more.","I understand that people want to just listen to a track and put it on their iPod, and that's fine, there's nothing wrong with that, but why can't that exist hand in hand with an album? They're such different experiences.","I suppose the worst case scenario is that people will get to the point where they can't actually afford to make what they want to make creatively. The industry is collapsing.","When I started music, I think it was responsible for keeping me sane, because training as a dancer really kept me in good spirits amid all the crazy stuff that happened when I first became popular.","I have this desire in the back of my mind now of making music and film at the same time - putting the two together.","My music can be a little obscure. It does worry me that the music might be too complicated for people to take in - that they have to work too hard at it.","I love being with my friends, relaxing and talking."],"Kate Capshaw":["The moment somebody says 'this is very risky' is the moment it becomes attractive to me.","The love story for me was the nature of the love and not the age of the lovers.","No one in the whole movie ever asks anyone, Did you write this letter' Part of the reason is that no one wants to hear that it isn't for them. As soon as they read it, they want it to be theirs.","The best preparation for acting is life - observing life and people and observing yourself. All that becomes your library. So when you have to research a part, a scene or an emotion, you go into the library and get what you need."],"Kate Chopin":["A person can't have everything in this world; and it was a little unreasonable of her to expect it.","She missed him the days when some pretext served to take him away from her, just as one misses the sun on a cloudy day without having thought much about the sun when it was shining.","There are some people who leave impressions not so lasting as the imprint of an oar upon the water.","To be an artist includes much; one must possess many gifts - absolute gifts - which have not been acquired by one's own effort. And, moreover, to succeed, the artist much possess the courageous soul.","When the doctors came they said she had died of heart disease - of joy that kills.","I trust it will not be giving away professional secrets to say that many readers would be surprised, perhaps shocked, at the questions which some newspaper editors will put to a defenseless woman under the guise of flattery.","Some people are born with a vital and responsive energy. It not only enables them to keep abreast of the times; it qualifies them to furnish in their own personality a good bit of the motive power to the mad pace.","But the beginning of things, of a world especially, is necessarily vague, tangled, chaotic, and exceedingly disturbing. How few of us ever emerge from such beginning! How many souls perish in its tumult!","I wonder if anyone else has an ear so tuned and sharpened as I have, to detect the music, not of the spheres, but of earth, subtleties of major and minor chord that the wind strikes upon the tree branches. Have you ever heard the earth breathe?","The generous abundance of her passion, without guile or trickery, was like a white flame which penetrated and found response in depths of his own sensuous nature that had never yet been reached.","It is greater than the stars - that moving procession of human energy; greater than the palpitating earth and the things growing thereon.","He greatly valued his possessions, chiefly because they were his, and derived genuine pleasure from contemplating a painting, a statuette, a rare lace curtain - no matter what - after he had bought it and placed it among his household gods.","So the storm passed and every one was happy.","It was still quite light out of doors, but inside with the curtains drawn and the smouldering fire sending out a dim, uncertain glow, the room was full of deep shadows.","She felt like a chess player who, by the clever handling of his pieces, sees the game taking the course intended. Her eyes were bright and tender with a smile as they glanced up into his; and her lips looked hungry for the kiss which they invited.","In the procession I should feel the crushing feet, the clashing discords, the ruthless hands and stifling breath. I could not hear the rhythm of the march."],"Kate Christensen":["My blog is a celebration of the unexpected, settled, happy life I find myself living in Portland, Maine, at the ripe old age of fifty with someone I deeply love and am very happy with. That's part of why I started the blog.","I don't feel that I've had a life of abuse or that I am a victim in any way. My life is pretty typical of a lot of Americans of my generation who grew up in the sixties in families like mine that were sort of unconventional.","Eating by myself in my own apartment, single and alone again for the first time in many years, I should have felt, but did not feel, sad. Because I had taken the trouble to make myself a real dinner, I felt nurtured and cared for, if only by myself. Eating alone was freeing, too; I didn't have to make conversation.","If there's a rift in the marriage - if someone feels neglected, frustrated, tempted by others, or unsure - then trouble can easily arise.","If I fell into one relationship after another with men who were either emotionally tuned out and unavailable or hotheaded and controlling, or both, it was because I was lacking in good sense about men.","At first blush, it seems odd that loser lit books are rejected initially, then go on to be fiercely loved by legions of readers. This apparent contradiction might be due to the fact that if they didn't screw up their lives, most losers would be the kind of power-elite, Type A go-getters whom readers love to hate.","In literature, older women are not often given center stage.","It gives me immense pleasure to be trustworthy, faithful, and true - to have the kind of romantic bond that inspires this.","Whenever possible, I use local, fresh ingredients, just because it tastes and feels better to eat an egg or a tomato or a hamburger that wasn't flown halfway around the world, that didn't travel on a truck and get stuck in traffic jams, that hasn't been sitting in a supermarket's refrigerator case for days.","Living in New York City is one constant, ongoing literary pilgrimage. For 20 years, I lived among the ghosts of great writers and walked where they had walked.","There are two kinds of ham: raw and cooked. Raw ham is cured with salt and/or smoke over time; cooked ham is boiled. Every culture that makes ham has its own unique and various methods.","Country ham is baked whole, usually with a glaze, sometimes studded with cloves, and served as the centerpiece of Christmas and Easter feasts.","I've always had rock star envy. Unfortunately, writing is a pedestrian, tame occupation done while sitting in coffee-stained pajamas in front of a computer rather than prowling around a huge stage in sweaty leather pants, so I have to get my kicks vicariously.","Each pineapple plant produces only one fruit per year. It can take up to two years for the pineapple to ripen, and it's important to wait, because once it's picked, it can't ripen any further. The unripe pineapple is not only horrible tasting but poisonous.","I remember the moment I first became aware of aging. I was 30. I looked down at my knees, and the skin above them had become a little loose. And I thought, 'And so it begins!'","It's interesting to try to imagine how early humans discovered what was edible and what wasn't. Who figured out that when you cooked stinging nettles, the sting would go away completely? How many people had to die before the relative toxicity of wild mushrooms became widely known?","I'm not a foodie - I'm an eater: I'm hungry.","'American Music' is an inventive, passionate, pithy novel whose major theme is love itself and whose minor theme, music, is an emotional, meaningful counterpoint. Like Count Basie and His Orchestra, this book swings.","In the aftermath of a marriage, you feel helpless and hapless.","I never see myself as writing satire. I think I write about people as they really are, without making them better or worse.","I wanted to write a food book, but I'm not a chef or an expert on culinary matters, to put it mildly.","Now that I'm 50 and respectably settled in New England and markedly happier and more contented than I was in my youth, I modestly hope there's time to realize some of my youthful goals before I croak, but I'll take what I can get.","In the case of the cashew, someone, somewhere, a long time ago determined that it had to be roasted. The cashew was once nicknamed the blister nut, because if you try to eat it raw from the tree, your mouth pays the price. The cashew is not a nut, however; it's a seed.","Ham is undoubtedly one of the most universally beloved of meats, at least in those parts of the world where it's not prohibited.","In the winter of 2012, as my fiftieth birthday approached, I began to write what turned into my autobiography, a look at my own life through the lens of food.","In a family of all girls, I was always the 'boy' in my mind - the protector, the masculine one. No one would ever have to worry about me.","My first novel, 'In the Drink,' begun when I was 29 and floundering and published when I was 36 and married, was about a 29-year-old woman whose life was even more screwed up than my own had been.","When I was younger, I read all the great food memoirs, by M.F.K. Fisher and Laurie Colwin and Julia Child and Nicolas Freeling and Ruth Reichl, and felt flooded with a sense of comfort and safety.","I think there's a part of my brain where food, language, and memory all intersect, and it's really powerful. I think I'm not alone in this.","I realized that I've had a really rocky relationship with food - it has not been a gauzy, beautiful summer of ripe melons and perfectly buttered toast.","I wrote my first story when I was six or seven.","I started reading G. K. Chesterton's 'The Man Who Was Thursday' on a subway ride, almost missed my stop, and walked home thumbing pages.","I've never been an outward rebel, but inside, I just rebel deeply.","It's hard for me to generalize about kids and divorce. I think every family's experience is different; some kids are devastated by it, others relieved, and so forth, no matter what generation they're from.","Often I choose characters who express not my best self, but the sides of me I haven't developed or haven't expressed.","Characters who don't suffer have no interest to me.","For writers and artists, it's always a balancing act between wanting to be the center of attention and wanting to be invisible and watch what's going on.","It makes you vulnerable to win an award. It's nice to get the attention, but your neck is stuck out.","I've always written about adultery because it raises the question of transgression and trouble.","With my friends in Brooklyn, many of them started out as artists. I saw many of these friends move into late middle age, still struggling without health insurance or a cushion. I saw people who had given up being artists. Being an artist necessitates a compromise or living on the edge.","I've cooked plenty of meals when I was sad, lonely, depressed, angry, bored, and/or under the weather. My primary aim in these circumstances is generally to cheer myself up, to fill my stomach with something warm so I can feel comforted and fed, usually just with a quick soup or an omelet.","Most of all, I love unfussy, unpretentious, simple food made with excellent ingredients. If I'm a snob, it's about quality, not cuisine.","I think my blog is fairly circumspect and elliptical. I've written personal essays, but they are short and to the point: in and out, and that's that.","Food is not a means toward resolution. It can't cure heartbreak or solve untenable dilemmas.","I have observed, through many years of living in north Brooklyn, that people, for example an ostensible group of friends, can be dangerous to one another.","My youngest sister belonged to a group called the Twelve Tribes for many years. She recently left, with her husband and four children. Talking to her about her experiences in the group is fascinating, moving, and enlightening.","Therapists have tremendous power over their vulnerable clients, and it is very easy to take advantage of this power.","'Blue Plate Special' is the autobiography of my first half-century of life, with food as the subject.","In 1990, when I had just arrived in New York City as a wet-behind-the-ears 20-something girl from Arizona, I spent a year or more working as the personal secretary and secret ghostwriter to an American-born countess in her apartment on the Upper East Side.","After a day of writing, I love nothing more than to go into my kitchen and start chopping onions and garlic on the way to cooking an improvised meal with whatever ingredients are on hand. Cooking is the perfect counterpoint to writing. I find it more relaxing than anything else, even naps, walks, or hot baths.","Loser lit antiheroes aren't well intentioned or earnest; they don't care whether you like them or not. They're self-mocking, ironic and inventive; they narrate their downfalls with manic wordplay, rampant metaphors, wisecracks, and escalating flights of spleen-fueled lyricism.","On Halloween, kids get to assume, for one night the outward forms of their innermost dread, and they're also allowed to take candy from strangers - the scariest thing of all.","Even more than dying itself, I'm scared of the horror-movie changes that happen to the human body as it ages. I think of it as a sort of haunted-house effect, living inside a crumbling, creaking structure that is full of ghosts and will, some day, fall down.","I love the perspective afforded by having lived five decades, a degree of bemused and muted calm, a relief from the insistent demands of a turbulent ego and rampant ambition. I'd love to stay here forever. But something tells me that 50 is a sunny idyll, a temporary state of grace, a golden afternoon.","There's a certain time of day after sunset when people naturally seem to feel the urge to gather by a fire or a stove or a hibachi or another common source of heat and food, and hunker down together to eat and drink. Call it the blue hour.","I regretted the solitary nature of the writer's life - other people, normal working people, spent their days with co-workers, rode the subway home with a crowd, walked through thronged streets. I worked at home, all by myself.","My 50th birthday approaching felt like a big milestone to me. I've lived half a century. If I write about food and use my life as a fulcrum to move the story along, maybe I've lived long enough to fashion a narrative that has a happy ending.","The phrase 'blue plate special' has always been one of the homiest, coziest, most sweetly nostalgic phrases in the English language for me.","My father's grandparents came from Norway and settled in the Scandinavian bastion of Minnesota. As a little girl in Tempe, Arizona, I daydreamed about picking cloudberries by a fjord in a fresh Nordic wind.","The New Nordic diet originated in 2004, when the visionary chefs Rene Redzepi and Claus Meyer called a symposium of regional chefs to address the public's increasing consumption of processed foods, additives, highly refined grains, and mass-produced poultry and meat.","After my experiences with the 5:2 diet, I wasn't interested in a short-term fix that would fail later. I wanted a way of eating that made me lose weight without feeling deprived.","Reminded of what a diet really is, I began eating more slowly, being more conscious of when I was full. I started to enjoy my buckwheat bread with goat cheese and pureed butternut-squash soup as a response to real hunger.","I grew up in an all-female family - two sisters and a mostly single mother - and we often bonded, in part, by disparaging men and feeling superior to them.","As my family saw them, men were untrustworthy, weak, and selfish. Our mother taught us to get along without them, to get along without much of anything, and to live well and have fun anyway.","Even after he was gone, I still loved my father. I looked Norwegian, like him, with a long face, strong jaw, thin mouth, and flashing eyes. And, like him, I was verbal, easygoing, and low-key on the surface, and, deep down, proud, socially paranoid, full of self-loathing, and prone to rage at injustice.","I never liked dolls or played house. I read and wrote, climbed trees, collected rocks, rode my bike, and befriended boys, platonically.","Reading a Lydia Davis story collection is like reaching into what you think is a bag of potato chips and pulling out something else entirely: a gherkin, a pepper corn, a truffle, a piece of beef jerky.","Littlenecks and cherrystones are chewy and sweet on the half shell with mignonette, served raw. But a well-cooked clam is a toothsome, tender thing, full of that magical stuff known as clam liquor.","If you've got cockles, those nickel-size, heart-shaped mollusks, and you want to get fancy, steam them, then toss the meat in finely ground cornmeal.","My favorite way to cook a clam is in chowder. I was a New Yorker for 20 years, and I always loved tomato-based, celery-heavy Manhattan chowders.","I left New York in 2009 when I fell in love with someone who had a farmhouse in New Hampshire... Portland, Maine, felt like the inevitable place for us.","I procrastinate all morning. That's when I get my office work done and answer e-mails and see what's on the Internet and do laundry.","It's really hard for me, every day, to confront my writing. It never gets easier over time.","Finding my way into a novel is always half the battle.","Chan Marshall has one of the most haunting, wrenching voices of any current singer, male or female.","Iggy Pop has a voice that's somehow simultaneously self-mocking, wild, precise, amused, righteous, cool, contained and bold. I don't know how he does what he does.","Iggy Pop is God, if God looked half that good with his shirt off.","To eat passionately is to allow the world in.","To taste fully is to live fully.","Broccoli gets such a bad rap. This is perplexing to those of us who love that green, treelike, stalky vegetable.","Famously cancer fighting, laden with vitamins, minerals, soluble fiber, and phytonutrients, broccoli and its relatives are among the healthiest ingredients of the human diet.","Of course, eating broccoli raw, nutritionally and aesthetically speaking, is no doubt the best way of all. Raw broccoli makes a delectable salad when sliced into thin strips on a mandolin, marinated in lemon-mustard vinaigrette, then tossed with toasted pecans or hazelnuts, halved cherry tomatoes, and fresh minced basil.","Broccoli, when overboiled, produces a sulfuric stench that causes children to gag the instant they enter the house.","A relative of poison ivy and poison sumac, the cashew contains the same rash-inducing chemicals, known as urushiols, as its kin.","There's almost nothing you can't do with a cashew. Not only does it lend its nutty sweetness to savory dishes, it also gives desserts a deep richness.","Although the pineapple had been widely disseminated for centuries among the native peoples of South and Central America, it didn't figure in European history until 1493.","Across the Atlantic, in the scattered, far-flung, rural settlements of colonial America, hospitality had become a central concern, and hostesses, like peacocks displaying their iridescent plumage, tried to outdo one another with their creative food displays.","David Levi is a teacher as well as a chef, and, like most teachers, he loves to talk.","The male muse is an unaccountably rare thing in art. Where does that leave female artists looking for inspiration?","I wrote my first novel in eighth grade for a boy named Kenny on whom I had an unrequited crush and who sat behind me in social studies.","Nostalgia is a powerful drug. Under its influence, ordinary songs take on dimensions and powers, like emotional superheroes."],"Kate Clinton":["Some women can't say the word lesbian... even when their mouth is full of one.","A friend of mine said, no matter what I do I always look like an English teacher. She actually said, you still look like a Campbell's Soup kid.","I try something new every night. It's an hour show; if it works I maybe try it a few more times and then move that off and try something new. It's a great workshop for me.","As you can imagine I'm disappointed as anything that I was not selected to be the presidential running mate. And I find it continually appalling that it would be a radical thing to have a woman on the ticket.","I consider a CD or a comedy collection as a record of what I've been doing, and I try to wrap it up and start new material.","I definitely want people to laugh because I don't think there's a better feeling - I think it's just so fabulous to laugh. I don't mind if people think, either. I think the brain is a very sexy organ.","I want to host a religious show. I'm sure nobody will be wanting the 11 o'clock spot on Sunday morning. I think we should really get some of our own preachers and preach that gay is good. And we'd have a great choir.","I'm happy to say that I'm a lesbian in the world. I know there are people who don't want to be called women comedians, but I think it gives a path to the fact that we live in extremely patriarchal times.","I'm really happy that I was raised Catholic because it's given me years of material.","Lesbian humor isn't trying to sell anything, it doesn't have to sell out. Coming out as a lesbian onstage is still a very political act; if it weren't, more women would do it.","Lesbians are likely to be drawn to stand-up, if only because it's cheaper to produce and therefore more accessible for women. But the very form of stand-up is masculine.","My style has been pretty much like a newspaper. It's got politics in it, it's got media, sports, family relations, you know, all the sections you would expect, and wonderful religion things.","They didn't even like Margaret Thatcher but at least there was Margaret Thatcher. There have been women, you know, Sonia Gandhi for heaven's sakes in India.","We really got a lot of very conservative gay people. You could look at the figures from the last election and realize that a third of the gay movement voted Republican.","We signed up for Showtime, which I think put us on a Homeland Security list somewhere.","What goes for sex goes double for politics.","When my brother-in-law, BIll Clinton, was elected, he had gay friends. That was a coming out."],"Kate DiCamillo":["If you read, the world is your oyster. It truly is. Reading makes everything possible.","If you want to be a writer, write a little bit every day. Pay attention to the world around you. Stories are hiding, waiting everywhere. You just have to open your eyes and your heart.","I think of myself as an enormously lucky person.","I write in my house, at my desk, where I have Christmas lights strung over it to try and convince me that I'm having a good time. I can't really write anywhere else.","I have a Bachelor of Arts in English, which means I had a lot of formal training in reading.","Reading should not be presented to children as a chore, a duty. It should be offered as a gift.","I actually participated in a Little Miss Orange Blossom Contest when was I was seven or eight years old. I remember standing up on the stage and thinking, 'Oh boy, I should not be here.' Obviously, I didn't win.","'Island of the Blue Dolphins' by Scott O'Dell had a huge impact on me.","It's such a potent thing, to be a kid. We grow up, and we don't want to remember how everything is so beautiful and terrifying when we're young. The older you get, the more you hope to muffle things.","It distresses me that parents insist that their children read or make them read. The best way for children to treasure reading is to see the adults in their lives reading for their own pleasure.","I am single and childless, but I have lots of friends and I am an aunt to three lovely children.","Every well-written book is a light for me. When you write, you use other writers and their books as guides in the wilderness.","Everything I write comes from my childhood in one way or another. I am forever drawing on the sense of mystery and wonder and possibility that pervaded that time of my life.","Hands down, the biggest thrill is to get a letter from a kid saying, I loved your book. Will you write me another one?","I always write with music. It takes me a while to figure out the right piece of music for what I'm working on. Once I figure it out, that's the only thing I'll play.","I am busier now than I ever imagined I would be, but I feel blessed in that I have found what I am supposed to be doing with my life. It's wonderful to tell stories and have people listen to them.","I didn't know anything about writing a screenplay, but somehow I ended up rewriting a screenplay.","I didn't start working on children's books until I got a job at a book warehouse on the children's floor. When I started reading some of the books, I was so impressed.","I hate to cook and love to eat.","I like to think of myself as a storyteller.","I thought I was going nowhere. Now I can see there was a pattern.","I was born in Philadelphia and currently live in Minneapolis. I write for both children and adults.","I work full-time in a used bookstore. I get up. I drink a cup of coffee. I think, The last thing I want to do is write. Then I go to the computer and write.","I'm at the mercy of whatever character comes into my head.","My father leaving the family shaped who I was and how I looked at the world. By the same token, my father telling me fairy tales that he had made up shaped me profoundly, too.","My goal is two pages a day, five days a week. I never want to write, but I'm always glad that I have done it. After I write, I go to work at the bookstore.","Understand, I had absolutely no interest in writing; I wanted to be a Writer.","I'm never impressed with myself!","I get my inspiration from looking at the world and paying attention to people and just looking closely. Also from reading. I get so much inspiration from other authors.","I have always been a reader. I was one of those kids desperate to learn. I would read anything.","I always wanted to be a character when I worked at Disney, but I wasn't short enough for certain characters, and I wasn't tall enough for others.","I've always been a doodler.","You have to learn how to write each book.","Everything about writing is hard for me except for that - the names pop into my head. That's one of the reasons why I always make sure I have a notebook with me.","I didn't really start to write until I was almost 30, and I started with the short stories.","I am stuck at 10 years old. I think.","Happily, I had lots of childhood heroes.","I was a kid who loved to read. I read everything I could get my hands on. I didn't have one favorite book. I had lots of favorite books: 'The Borrowers' by Mary Norton, 'Paddington' by Michael Bond, 'A Little Princess' by Frances Hodgson Burnett, 'Stuart Little' by EB White, 'A Cricket in Times Square,' all the Beverly Cleary books.","I read a couple of books a week. About 80 percent of what I read is contemporary literature for adults. The other 20 percent is made up of non-fiction and children's books.","I feel like the luckiest person in the world to have found what I am supposed to do and to get to do it.","I want to remind people of the great and profound joy that can be found in stories, and that stories can connect us to each other, and that reading together changes everybody involved.","I'm not going to make judgments about what people are reading. I just want them to be reading. And I think reading one book leads to another book.","I think our job is to trust our readers. I think our job is to see and to let ourselves be seen. I think our job is to love the world.","I have no talents. But I do have hope. And wonder. And love. Maybe those are talents?","My father - he was an orthodontist - was supposed to sell his practice and move down to Florida, but that never happened... I would sometimes spend the summer with him and visit him, but he never lived with us.","I don't know what my mother was thinking, but she entered me in a Little Miss contest - Little Miss Orange Blossom, I think it was. And I don't remember anything about that, except I have one flash-bulb memory of standing on the stage and thinking, 'This is not where I should be.'","I think hope and magic are probably connected.","When I was a kid, it never occurred to me that human beings wrote books. It was a kind of cognitive dissonance for me... I just didn't think it was something that people did.","We have this thing as human beings: we have a profound need for story. That's what kids need.","When you write for kids, people always ask you what lesson you mean to impart. I don't think adult writers get that question. I never mean to teach anybody a lesson, because I don't know anything myself.","I have a part-time dog. I'm actually an aunt to a dog, and he's an awful dog, but I love him. He's only interested in doing what he wants to do.","My parents are separated. My father left when I was six years old.","I had it in my head when I was in college that I wanted to be a writer, but it took me a long time to commit to being a writer. Up until then, I had worked one dead-end job after another while writing on the side.","Writing a novel isn't like building a brick wall. You don't figure out how to do it, and then it gets easier each time because you know what you're doing. With writing a novel, you have to figure it out each time. Each time you start over, you just have the language and the idea and the hope.","When I was 5 years old, I moved with my mother and brother from Philadelphia to a small town in Florida. People talked more slowly there and said words I had never heard before, like 'ain't' and 'y'all' and 'ma'am.' Everybody knew everybody else. Even if they didn't, they acted like they did.","I was a very sickly kid and suffered from chronic pneumonia, which is why we moved to the warm southern climate. I think being ill contributed to my development as a writer. I learned early on to entertain myself by reading.","Writing my own stories had always been one of my dreams, but I didn't start until I was 29. I was working in a book warehouse and was assigned to the third floor where all the children's books were. For four and a half years, I spent all day, every day around children's books, and it wasn't long before I fell in love with them.","How do I feel when I look back at prior work? Hmmm. I think, 'I tried to do the best I could do. It's not perfect. It will never be perfect.' And then I think, 'I want to try again.'","To me, this is one of the great things about writing kids' books: the illustrations.","I was someone who wanted to be a writer but who wasn't writing. I was someone buying books on writing. I was someone telling people that I was writer. But I was not writing.","Writing at home and then going out into the world to talk about why books matter to me feeds the writing. It's a good mix. It provides balance.","If you sit down and read with your kid, either having your child read to you or you reading to your child at a regular time each day, it deepens the relationship. You don't have to talk about stuff; the story will do that work for you.","Everybody reading the same book at the same time pulls people together. It does start a conversation. If you're going to read 'The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane,' you're going to talk about heartbreak and loss and all of those things that people don't talk about as a community.","There's still, even now, a part of me that can't believe that I got published. That part of me has never gone away.","I always have a notebook with me, I eavesdrop; I write down what people say. It's very rare that one of those things will provoke a story, but I think that that kind of paying attention all the time, and keeping everything open, lets the stories come in. But where they come from is still a mystery to me.","I was lucky enough to have a mother who took me to the library - the public library - twice a week, Wednesdays and Saturdays. And also bought me books. And also read aloud to me.","I decided a long time ago that I didn't have to be talented. I just had to be persistent.","I was a shy, terrified kid. But I was also a kid who was lucky enough to have friends. I laughed with those friends. I had adventures. We dreamed together. I relied on them.","Whenever I am with a group of kids, I always ask them, 'How many of you know about the summer reading program at your library and how many of you know it's free?' Spreading that sort of message comes very naturally to me.","It's a very powerful, emotional thing to read a book, and to reduce it to a series of questions in a test strips something away from the book.","Whether it is fear of having fish pie or staying in someone's house or not being able to tell the time, all of those things I can remember very clearly. We so often forget how big all these things are for very small children because they are so often trying these things for the first time.","How do you make your kids read more? It needs to be presented as a joy and a privilege to get to do it, and the kids should get to see you as a parent reading for your own pleasure. It's not something you send your kids off to do, 'Go into your room and read for 15 minutes or else.' It becomes a task then.","It wasn't until my fifth or sixth book where I realized I'm trying to do the same thing in every story I tell, which is bring everybody together in the same room.","I think that sometimes we open our hearts a little more easily to animals than we do to each other.","I find that when I write for children, I am more hopeful, less cynical. I don't use different words or a different sentence structure. I just hope more.","In a first draft, I concentrate on moving forward and trying not to panic.","So much of writing is like walking down a dark hallway with your arms out in front of you. You bump into a lot of things.","Progress is hard to measure in any creative endeavor, I think. It's often a matter of instinct, of feeling your way through what works and what doesn't.","I can never tell if anything I do is really good. I'm always just slightly chagrined.","There's this amplification that happens anytime you tell a story. You let it go out into the world. It's the most beautiful thing. All I can do is look at it in wonder and amazement.","From a cognitive standpoint, I'm very aware that you have no room for error in a picture book. Every word counts.","When I was starting to write, I was fascinated with 'Knuffle Bunny' by Mo Willems. I remember taking it home and typing it out, trying to figure out how it worked. It's just a classic, with dauntingly few words."],"Kate Dickie":["I turn into a crying, hysterical maniac when I see a spider. It's pathetic.","I don't feel drawn to lightness, I need something more. I feel that - oh, I hate saying this, it sounds so wanky - but I feel a real urge to give voices to people we don't usually hear from in real life.","There are always reasons for people's behaviour, and it's easy just to dismiss them and assume that we already know their story, especially if they're no good at showing their emotions. Life gives you all these knocks, it's so easy to form a shell to protect yourself. I've done it myself.","I hate going into a room with people in it and the feeling of them staring. I find every moment excruciating.","I've been angst-ridden all my life, but finally I'm in a place where things don't matter so much.","I'm usually in jammies and slippers by 8 P.M.","I would love to study cultures and people."],"Kate Flannery":["I think the genetics of being Irish are that you sort of prefer when it's rainy and cloudy. It's just genetic.","I do have a lot of female friends who are stand-ups and also women who are actresses and also happen to have an act.","I think the whole concept that women aren't funny is dead. It's over; it's done.","I love Tig Notaro; I just think she's so awesome.","Well, one of the things I love about 'The Office' is that it has so much heart.","I think comedy is funnier when it's real.","I feel like I'm the luckiest actress in the world.","I cannot believe that in all the years that there have been female stand-ups, there has never been a show just for them.","'TV Guide' is smart to aim toward women. More women will go there to find out what's on - just like when guys won't ask for directions, a woman will break out the map.","It's easy for people to strike if they're not working on a regular basis.","I feel like people are funny, and women are people, so I'm sick of the distinction.","Obviously I've gone out of my way in my career to not look good, so it's always nice to, every once in a while, get the opposite going."],"Kate Fleetwood":["But nothing beats a Woody Allen film on a Sunday night, with a glass of wine and some leftovers.","My guilty pleasure is reality TV, as I am really nosey.","I read everything by Ian McEwan, he is so elegant. I love reading anything about Shakespeare, too. He is my first love. If I had a time machine, I would be hanging out with him.","I am a total sucker for an actor's autobiography/biography. I have probably read most of them.","When you're an actor, you just hope you get a job to go to.","Being on Broadway and getting a Tony nomination - this has been an incredible ride, from rather humble beginnings.","When you have young children, it is hard to see live performances. Unless I am in it. I do manage to see my husband Rupert Goold's work, of course.","I looked at but was not allowed to touch Ai Weiwei's 'Sunflower Seeds' at the Tate. The film of making them was really moving.","I would see anything by Antony Gormley.","I am a massive fan of early electronica like Steve Reich, Pat Metheny and Thomas Dolby. I used to be a big raver, too, so anything dance. I love ambient music like Tunng. I love acoustic and classical, too.","When you're in a rehearsal room, it's like getting into a car and going on a long journey with everyone's stuff in the back. If you keep stopping the car and going, 'Are you sure we want to go?' and think, 'This is really daunting,' you will get frightened, so you just have to keep ploughing through it.","I'd quite like to direct. I don't think it will happen, but my urge is that way inclined.","The Forest of Arden, where I grew up, is where 'As You Like It' is set. It was idyllic.","My parents are not theatrical people, but my dad took me to the theater."],"Kate Forsyth":["I love fairy tales because of their haunting beauty and magical strangeness. They are set in worlds where anything can happen. Frogs can be kings, a thicket of brambles can hide a castle where a royal court has lain asleep for a hundred years, a boy can outwit a giant, and a girl can break a curse with nothing but her courage and steadfastness.","Fairy tales are stories of triumph and transformation and true love, all things I fervently believe in.","Stories are the common ground that allow people to connect, despite all our defences and all our differences.","I was attacked by a dog when I was a toddler, and my injuries were so bad, I spent quite a bit of my childhood in and out of hospital. Books were absolutely my salvation during those years.","Fairytales work on two levels. On a conscious level, they are stories of true love and triumph and overcoming difficult odds and so are pleasurable to read. But they work on a deeper and symbolic level in that they play out our universal psychological dramas and hidden desires and fears.","Storytelling is as old as speech. It existed before humans first began to carve shapes in stones and press their hands upon the rocky walls of caves.","One reason why so little is known about the German resistance is because it was never a united movement in the way that it was in France or Poland. It was simply too dangerous.","The ogres and witches and giants of fairytales stand in as metaphors for those obstacles that we all face in our own lives.","I have struggled all my life with my stuttering. Not to mention all my other speech impediments. I think I have every language disorder known to speech pathologists.","As an adult, I have often been deep in serious conversation with someone I've highly respected and seen them roll an eye as my mouth has mangled yet another magnificently conceived, clumsily articulated sentence. In my mind, the words are mellifluous as honey. In my mouth, they are shards of glass.","To tell the truth, fairytales have never gone out of style. They have been told and retold for thousands of years, finding new shapes and structures with each new generation of tellers.","I wrote my novel 'Bitter Greens' as the creative component of a Doctorate of Creative Arts and am now looking at the history of the Rapunzel tale as my theoretical component.","Once upon a time, I was a little girl sick in the hospital, and my mother gave me a copy of 'Grimm's Fairy Tales' to comfort me.","As I grew up, I read and loved many fairy-tale retellings and began to think about writing my own reimagining of 'Rapunzel.'","Many people think fairy tales and retellings of fairy tales are only for children, but I'm not the only writer to take an old tale and retell it for a sophisticated adult audience.","It has always seemed a cruel joke to me that the very word 'stutter' is difficult for many stutterers to pronounce. It is onomatopoeic, an imitation of the halting, repetitive sound made by people with this speech dysfunction.","Every word we speak calls on 37 muscles and thousands of nerves. It's not surprising that sometimes these nerves and muscles fail us.","You cannot write a book unless it is totally inhabiting your imagination and you are totally engrossed with it. Which is a kind word for obsession.","Since the moment I could hold a pencil, I have spent nearly all day every day writing. And there is not an age group that I have not written for. You can read me from birth 'til death.","One of the biggest mistakes people make is to think that what you need to write a novel is imagination, creativity and a facility with words. Yes, you need all those things, but a novel is a highly complex organism that needs to be dealt with in quite a logical manner.","Stories are like that. Like cities, they are built on the stones and bones of the past.","When our ancestors crouched about the camp fire at night, they told each other tales of gods and heroes, monsters and marvels, to hold back the terrors of the night. Such tales comforted and entertained, diverted and educated those who listened, and helped shape their sense of the world and their place in it.","We all want to win against all odds. We all want to be loved. We all wish it was possible to change our world and to make our world a better place.","Sanitising stories, leaching out all of the sense of danger and the darkness out of the stories, actually reduces them and stops them from doing what they're supposed to do, which is teach us how to manage our lives.","Fairytales were never really meant for children; they were meant as cautionary tales for teenagers on the verge of growing up.","The storyline of a fantasy novel is filled with such a sense of enchantment, beauty and strangeness; it allows the writer to explore the big ontological questions of life that would sound like a sermon in a social realist novel."],"Kate Fox":["Men gossip for just as long and about the same subjects as women, but tend to talk more about themselves.","Male and female gossip also sounds different, as women use more animated tones, more detail and more feedback.","Women are more skilled than men at making gossip entertaining.","Researchers have found very little difference between men and women in terms of the amount of time spent gossiping."],"Kate Greenaway":["Living in that childish wonder is a most beautiful feeling - I can so well remember it. There was always something more - behind and beyond everything - to me, the golden spectacles were very, very big.","I have made it a rule for a long time, not to part with the copyright of my drawings, for I have been so copied, my drawings reproduced and sold for advertisements and done in ways I hate."],"Kate Grenville":["Each language has its own take on the world. That's why a translation can never be absolutely exact, and therefore, when you enter another language and speak with its speakers, you become a slightly different person; you learn a different sort of world.","I think with all my books, language has been their subject as much as anything else. Language can elide or displace or sideline whole groups of people. You can't necessarily change the way language is used, but if it becomes something you're conscious of... that gives you a certain power over it.","A culture produces ideas which are being explored, which of interest to that culture at that moment. And I think one of the things a writer can do is to take those ideas and go a bit further with them.","Australia lives with a strange contradiction - our national image of ourselves is one of the Outback, and yet nearly all us live in big cities. Move outside the coastal fringe, and Australia can feel like a foreign country.","I'm a great believer in the experiential theory of writing.","I would never write a sentence that didn't have a nice rhythm, or at least I wouldn't leave it to be published like that. It seems to me that prose mustn't be prosaic.","I read a lot of poetry, and I love what it does with language. I love music, too, and I think there's probably no coincidence there, that the rhythm of the words is almost as important as the words themselves, and when you can get the two working together, which usually takes me about 20 goes, I feel a huge satisfaction.","I've always had a problem with conventional punctuation of dialogue because it does seem to me to set it off too much from the narrative. I mean, in life, things don't stop while somebody says something, and then stuff starts up again; it's all happening at once.","'The Secret River' began because, at the age of 50, I suddenly realised I knew nothing about how my own family had got its foothold in Australia.","I do feel as if... Look, I think I'm a very kind of ordinary person, and it seems to me that things that are of interest to me will probably be of interest to other people. I'm not exceptional; I don't have exceptional thoughts.","I love to write a book out of questions; in fact, I think it's the only way my writing can operate, if there's something I don't understand.","When I went to university in Colorado, I was encouraged to write very innovative, experimental things, and some of the short stories in 'Bearded Ladies' are a little bit experimental.","Nothing much interested me other than playing with language and telling stories and doing something with the wonders of the world around me.","For years I've wanted to write about the Australian countryside, but, like most Australians, I've only got a tourist's knowledge of it. I thought that if I disobeyed that basic rule of writing - write about what you know - I'd write a thin and inauthentic book.","Words are a pretty blunt instrument. There's always going to be slippage between the words and the infinite complexities of a thought. As a writer, I find that frustrating, but as a social animal, I wouldn't have it any other way.","One of the things I love about writing is the way you can use what you know and what you've experienced, without actually writing about yourself. I've given many of my experiences and perceptions to many of the characters in the book, but none of them is me."],"Kate Hudson":["I make sure I eat well without depriving myself of the things that I love: a cheeseburger and fries, creamy white-truffle pasta, bowls of ice cream. Everything in moderation, but I indulge at least three times a week.","Happiness is not something that just comes to you. It's an active process.","I smoke, isn't that terrible?","A lot of people are quite discouraged by the process of getting healthy because, one, they think they can't afford it, and two, it's daunting. I wanted to start a dialogue. Because you won't be able to even get there until you actually accept yourself and start connecting with yourself.","Honesty will never break you.","I like when life is sort of spontaneous. I like the unexpected. I'm comfortable in that!","I'm big on manners. I'm big on politeness. I'm big on gratitude.","The only things I'm competitive in are backgammon and poker.","Nothing, literally nothing, makes me feel like I'm back to my body more than Pilates.","You have a choice: Support the woman standing next to you, or compete with her. But if you compete, you're going to be miserable.","If I feel like I need a little color, I'll get a natural spray tan. Not only does this give me a little extra coverage, but it also allows me to achieve the bronzed look I want without the sun damage.","I'm superstitious... but not like wear the same underwear for two weeks superstitious.","When you're nursing and you're working 18-hour days, that's pretty hard.","I'm not afraid of heights. I rock climb. I can repel off the side of a building.","I went on countless auditions. I begged my parents until I finally was allowed to be in a theatrical play when I was 13. It was the most important thing in my life.","Do you know what a blessing it is to make movies that make people happy?","I'm very flirtatious, and I enjoy it.","I think that's like the age-old psychological core issue for any situation. Anybody who has had an experience with a parent that is absent, it's going to manifest.","I actually really love to work out. You need to find what you love.","If something's not right, I don't believe in maintaining something for the sake of what's considered a traditional family, because I believe that there are different ways to raise children. It's far more effective to raise children in happy homes.","The best thing I probably do is - I'll say I'm a pretty darn good parent. I got good kids.","To create a nice relationship with an ex, the love has to change form. I think you just have to put your children first.","You have people who can't act and they get all these parts. Paris Hilton falls into her own category. She's made a career out of it.","Somebody can become a celebrity for being stupid. That is what it's turned into.","Never worry about bad press: All that matters is if they spell your name right.","If it's a big hit, fantastic. If it's not, then it's not. I don't worry about my work.","I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies, believe it or not.","I talked to ex-wives of musicians of the '70s for research. They're the funniest people in the world, yet there is this sad, beautiful thing in their eyes that says they've seen more than they could ever possibly tell you.","I have never done a thriller, and it will just be really fun for me to heave and pant and run and climb and break windows and scream every once in a while.","I gained 60 pounds, and I'm proud of it. Why do I need to watch my weight when I'm pregnant? I could eat whatever the hell I want to eat.","I don't know if people really want to know how I feel about drugs. I'm not such a stickler. I believe you can choose to live your life any way you want.","I auditioned on my own. I tried to make a mark for myself without anybody's help, not even Mom's.","I always wanted to be a mom.","I did not like leaving them when they were little or big. You have to have priorities regarding what you will allow to take you away from your kid.","If you work out 20 minutes a day in some way, you're going to see changes.","Relationships ending are painful, and you can choose to carry that, or you can choose to reframe it.","My parents aren't married. And one of the reasons why they never got married is because they had been married before, and they liked it the way it was. They didn't feel like they needed a piece of paper to be committed. So for me, I know that marriage is not a golden ticket.","To me, I think when women who have children are fighting overseas, that's long distance. And that's very challenging. I really honor those families that do that.","Forgiveness in any aspect of something that is complex is the greatest tool.","I pick the wrong kinds of guys, but they're so hot.","I was a dancer, so for me, if I don't work out for a week or move my body in some sense, I feel weird.","I think any message behind a lifestyle brand should embrace everyone.","The goal when you get into a relationship is not to be out of the relationship. It's to try to stay in the relationship. But if it doesn't work, you can't force those things.","I really do feel very lucky. I've had my kids and my relationships. I've set my life down - I'm in my house, and I'm alone with my children - and I'm at peace, and that's a really nice feeling. All I really want in my life is to maintain that.","I was looking at my Instagram, and someone said to me, 'Who manages your Instagram?' I would never let anyone manage my Instagram! I enjoy it.","If I want to go out and eat at a restaurant with amazing food, I'll do that, like, once a week where I'm not thinking about it. I want to indulge! I want to do things that are not necessarily healthy sometimes.","Sometimes I'll lock myself in a room and dance. I'll turn music on as loud as possible and just get weird!","When I exercise, I need to connect to myself and see how I'm feeling at the moment because my mood is constantly changing.","I was 19 when I discovered Pilates, and I'm still doing it. It's the workout my body really responds to. It's all about alignment, elongating your spine, and strengthening your core. It makes me feel my strongest.","I'm a nature girl. I grew up in Colorado and was always outside. I still am, even when I'm in the city.","I love my shape because I work really hard at it. I honor my body by working out and seeing what it can do.","Some days, I feel like I should win Best Mom of the Day award, and some days, I find myself doing strange things that don't have any real purpose, in faraway corners in my house, and I realize I am literally and deliberately hiding from my children.","Yes, I help my kids with their homework. But I also get bored doing it. I will sit and listen to my children pontificate and discuss their ideas till the day is long because it warms my heart, but I really don't want to do math!","My workout mantra is 'Break a sweat every day.' Even if it's just for 20 minutes. I'm very disciplined about that.","A triathlon is on my bucket list. I started training a long time ago, and my life took a different turn: Things happen; work happens. I will definitely accomplish that at some point!","I talk about everything. I'm like the person who comes home and can't hide anything. Even my friends sometimes are like, 'Kate, you've got to stop talking so much about your life.' And I'm like, 'Why?' I can't keep things in, really.","A lot of people don't want to grow up because it sucks.","As a woman, and as a working mom trying to get things done, you find yourself meeting adversity a lot, but you never talk about it because you don't want to bring attention to it. You don't want to go there.","I live by a rulebook of eating alkaline - no meat, no dairy, no gluten, I try to stay away from sugar - but I'll cheat when I want to since I'm a bit of a foodie.","While I try to keep my fitness regimen consistent, during awards season, I'm especially conscious of what I'll be wearing and plan my workouts accordingly.","I'm a big Peyton Manning fan.","I just keep working out. You can't stop. Everyone thinks there's a trick, but there's no trick! The trick is, you have to be consistent.","If you're not mindful about sugar, high sugar intake is just the worst thing for you, but I'm, like, everything in moderation, and that's how I approach it.","We get to a point where we're like, you know what, one day we're just not gonna be here anymore, so I'm going to enjoy every second of it.","What makes Mom the best is that she never put any expectations too high on the kids. She just wanted us to be doing the things that made us happy, as long as we were working hard, but we never had to live up to something.","I'm going to go to work out, and I'm going to enjoy it, and I'm going to eat really healthy. But I'm going to go to Vegas, and I'm going to stop at In-N-Out Burger, and then I'll be back on track.","I didn't just wake up one day understanding how to take care of myself. I had to learn how to do so over time, and I continue to learn - each and every day. This is a process, and my body is constantly changing. So is yours. And when I learned how to accept that I will always be like this, I relaxed. Our bodies do not stand still for time."],"Kate Jackson":["I left my mark on 'Dark Shadows.' One day I was doing my lines perfectly from Act 3. Everyone else was doing Act 2.","All women should understand that a mammogram is nothing to be afraid of. It's not an enemy but a friend. Early detection is the key to the cure.","I'm married now, so I have a life. I had to get a life. That's one thing I really had to do, you know. You do that kind of work on television series after television series and you don't have a life. So, that's part of what I did while I was gone, I got a life.","I'd rather share the glory of a hit than star by myself in a flop.","Sometimes the better an actor is, the less he's noticed.","As someone who has had cancer, I learned that you don't have to die. Look at me. Because of early detection, I'm fine. I'm cured. I'm well.","I feel very lucky."],"Kate Jenkinson":["What I like about Rebel's style of comedy is she never plays the victim... she's never been fazed by her shape; it's just the way it is. She would mock her appearance whatever she looked like.","I have a small family, but they are all still in Perth, and I am still very close with my high-school friends."],"Kate Klise":["Our job as friends, mentors, parents, and writing coaches is not to write anyone's college essay. That's cheating. Plus, it sends a discouraging message to the teenager that he or she can't be trusted with this important assignment. Trust the student to write the essay, but verify that it gets done. Gentle editing and proofreading are allowed.","I like that there's no love as fierce as the love you feel for your family; that there's no one you feel more protective of than the very same people who can drive you crazy.","As writers, we must keep throwing problems at our characters. Conflict is the heart of good storytelling. Hiking in nature along a twisting trail can remind us what a good story feels like. It's the opposite of a treadmill - or an interstate highway.","Recent studies have shown that our creativity is increased by 60% when we're walking. I encourage my workshop participants to write at their desks but think on their feet.","During the holiday season, it's easy to forget that sometimes the best gift of all is simply the gift of time. I can't think of anything a writer would appreciate more than being given time and space to work.","Early in my publishing career, someone told me I'd need to have five books in print before I could quit my job as a journalist. Turns out it was closer to 10 books. It also turns out that while it's great to see my titles on bookstore shelves, my best customers are schools and libraries.","The older I get, the more I appreciate the idea of being thrown together with a group of people you might have a lot in common with, or nothing at all. You don't have the option of doing anything other than making your family relationships work - forever. I like that.","The tagline at Westin hotels is that they strive to surprise and delight their guests. This is exactly what a college essay should do.","I want to give kids that fall-off-the-bed-laughing feeling. Either that, or the sixth-grade feeling that life is hard - sometimes unbearably hard - and it is ultimately about death. But in the meantime, life can be really funny, too.","I love the Bronte sisters, but I feel a closer kinship to the Ephron sisters, Nora and Delia, if only because their work makes me laugh more than the Brontes. I also love the Mitford sisters with their secret language and their endless letters back and forth.","I like working on stories where I can explore the darker corners of childhood without illustrations but with humor.","I'm still driven by the feeling I had when I wrote my first book or read a Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle adventure.","Among my books, the ones that sell best are for readers between the ages of 8 and 12. According to a study by the Association of American Publishers, the largest area of industry growth in 2014 was in the children and young adult category.","Many adult book authors supplement their income by teaching at the college level. Full-time professors fare well, but pay for adjunct professors is notoriously shabby. Children's book authors have a sweeter deal. We're invited by schools, libraries, law firms, and Fortune 500 companies to share our best writing tips and strategies.","Writing for children isn't easy. Kids will abandon a story that doesn't interest, enchant, delight, thrill, or terrify them. But when you can find a way into a young reader's imagination through something as simple as words on paper, well, there's nothing more satisfying.","Every writer dreams of having a backyard cottage, similar to Dahl's 'writing hut.' English cottages and charming huts might seem out of reach, but a good carpenter could build a modest cottage on the cheap.","I like to take writing retreats within a day's drive of home. Less travel time means more time for writing, which is the name of the game here.","One of the best essays I've seen in recent years was by a young woman who wrote about how being chosen to choreograph a high school musical forced her to assume a leadership role she wasn't sure she was ready for - but of course she was.","When I lead essay workshops, I ask students to come up with at least five topics, which they'll narrow down to one. The winning idea should be the story the student is most excited to tell because it honestly reflects his or her best self.","The smartest thing I ever did as a writer was hire a retired conservation agent to blaze a hiking trail for me. It's nothing fancy - just a narrow path that meanders for a little over a mile through the woods near my home. But that trail through the trees has become my therapist, my personal trainer, and my best editor.","I'm so convinced that hiking helps my writing that I recently decided to offer a series of hiking-writing workshops to see if others had the same experience.","For years, friends in Springfield, Missouri, have remarked on the physical resemblance between Brad Pitt and his only brother, Doug. But the two share a deeper similarity: their commitment to charitable causes."],"Kate Levering":["I never read reviews - I never have. I've never read message boards, either. I'm just not interested in it in any way - I'm not interested in it inflating my ego, and I'm not interested in it improving my self-worth. So, I don't read them.","I came to New York when I was eighteen years old, and the first audition that I ever went to was this huge cattle call at the Equity building where I had gone two days earlier to sign up - I didn't have an agent or anything. It was for 'Chicago.' There were probably three hundred people there.","I came to New York when I was eighteen years old, and the first audition that I ever went to was this huge cattle call at the Equity building where I had gone two days earlier to sign up - I didn't have an agent or anything.","I've been dancing since I was seven, but I never really developed a regimen until I was on Broadway and responsible for a professional performance every night.","I adapt my workouts to what my needs are.","Eating-wise, I'm fairly disciplined. I have to be, because if you're not eating correctly, you're not giving your body the fuel it needs. So, I stay away from carbs after the morning, and I eat a lot of protein - fish, chicken, and no red meat.","I really try to get eight hours of sleep, and I really try not to go out after a Tuesday or Friday night show because I know I have a two-show day the following day."],"Kate Mara":["I have a ridiculous fear of sharks but I'd jump in the water in a second for an amazing role.","Whenever I dream about flying, it's the best feeling in the world.","Keeping your private life as private as possible is the smartest thing.","I like traditions, and the national anthem is important.","Rooting for the offense is the safe way to go. You win either way.","I feel so lucky.","I have so many friends who have no idea what they want to do. They are out of college and working, but not sure they are doing what they want to do, which is normal.","Eventually you get bored and you want to work.","I remember telling the agent, 'I don't want to do anything but Broadway.' She was like, 'That's not really possible because there is not that much Broadway. So I'll send you out on TV and stuff like that.'","All the actors I respect, especially old-Hollywood actors, the reason I think so many of them have had long careers is that there is a sort of mystery about them. You don't know what they do on Friday nights when they go home from work. You have no clue. You have this sort of fantasy about them.","I hated school.","When my agents tell me how much I'm going to be paid for a film, instead of quoting a figure, they'll say: 'You're going to make ten pairs of Christian Louboutins.'","I want to do something crazy for a part - something I'd never even consider in real life.","I don't ever take anything for granted.","In New York, you can just wake up and everything sorts itself out. I love that, not having a plan.","Everybody has to be responsible for their own actions - and if they do something wrong, I believe in paying for it.","I wish no teams had cheerleaders. I find it more distracting than anything else.","I was excited to get the opportunity to sing something in a movie 'cause I love musicals and I would love to be able to do more movie musicals, in the future.","It's really nice to be in something that you really love and want to share with people. And then, for it to actually get shown and for people to be able to see it is awesome. It's really exciting.","I've always wanted to do a period piece.","I've definitely become more aware and conscious of what directors I'm working with because it's so important. The director is really more than half the battle of the film. You really rely on that. That's become really, really important to me, for sure.","I'm an idiot.","If 10 years ago I was told I'd be where I am now, I would've been pretty happy.","I feel like I'm exactly where I should be.","I am so loyal.","I hate being in Los Angeles when it's football season. I want to be in New York. It just doesn't feel right if I'm away.","There's nothing worse than people who want to make you feel better when you are losing. I just want to smack them.","Let's be honest: I just want a Super Bowl ring.","Even when I was a kid, I had this insane head of flaming hair. It looked like a wig."],"Kate McKinnon":["Comedy is a tool of togetherness. It's a way of putting your arm around someone, pointing at something, and saying, 'Isn't it funny that we do that?' It's a way of reaching out.","I tried for a short time to be something I wasn't, and had no success with it. It's a practical solution to just be yourself.","You've gotta believe in yourself, and you just have to work harder at it than you've ever worked at anything before in your life. And if you keep doing that and keep believing in yourself, great things do happen.","I feel like science and art are cousins.","I really like collections of things. I love antique botanical prints with a bunch of different weeds and seeds.","Progress, real progress, makes me cry harder than anything. When the world itself grows.","I will not hear a word against him. I love my Bieber!","I've never had a couch that needed to be cleaned or learned how to couch-clean in general. That feels too grown-up.","What's not to love about a crazy cat lady? You have to be very giving to be a crazy cat lady.","I'm a very low-key person, but for some reason, I like to act out.","Getting recognized on the street is fine, but I never really wanted to be famous. I just wanted to have mastered the art of sketch comedy.","I'm a physical comedian first - and I'm a woman before that.","My mom watches really obscure stuff on IFC. She's a real comedy fan. She knows everything that's going on.","I only come up with things when I am talking to myself, which I do constantly. The sidewalk and the subway are the best places for this. I speak at full volume and then laugh at myself if I like what I just said.","I was very serene, and I still am, until I start talking in another voice, then suddenly I have a lot of volume and I'm frantic. But I didn't want to be one of those people who's always talking in accents in real life, so I started doing sketch comedy.","I pride myself on being tragically uncool.","The first impression that I liked doing was an impression of Cheri Oteri's Barbara Walters impression on 'SNL.' I found that I could mimic that pretty well, and people got a kick out of that.","If I had my druthers, I would be a brain in a jar, with a burlap skirt around the cart I'm on - I don't attend to my physical being much.","Comedy has become, I think, a very important branch of public intellectualism. But it still ain't Washington.","I was just never discouraged from doing something wacky like trying to be a comedian.","Nothing makes me laugh more than farting.","I've been a big astrophysics nut since I was 12. I have always had a real soft spot for the bizarreness of quantum mechanics. But I gave up on being a scientist in high school - I'm just not that good at math.","I love the produce section at the grocery store.","It's such an insult that foul gas comes out of a hole in our butt with a sound to announce itself. It's the ultimate bad thing about being a person.","I've been told I'm a little bit eccentric.","I love gross kissing. I think it's the most fun thing to do.","Basically hated everything made in the '80s, music television - it was really about the '90s for me. 'Encino Man' was a big hit. 'Robin Hood: Men in Tights.'","For an impression, I just find that I can do a lot of the people I love without much research, because I've already watched hours and hours of them on video and it seeped into my brain while I wasn't thinking about it.","I started watching 'SNL' when I was thirteen or so; those were the Molly Shannon/Ana Gasteyer/Cheri Oteri years.","Getting recognized on the street is fine, but I never really wanted to be famous.","If you asked me to seriously kiss someone on a screen, I would be very uncomfortable. But I will lick any part of your face.","I worked as a telemarketer for an SAT-prep company. That was the worst of it, because I had to call people in post-Katrina New Orleans and offer them this very, very expensive SAT class. And I'm not even a good salesman.","There was just a lot of comedy on the TV in the house, and my parents are both very funny.","I love Jared Hess' movies. He's such a weirdo and such a nice, funny guy.","I just like playing unique characters that I love.","I hate the feeling of having hair on my neck.","A good impression is sort of a juxtaposition of disparate elements.","I grew up with a pet iguana named Willy. We had a very contentious relationship. It turns out that iguanas are not meant to live in suburban homes.","I always wanted to live alone for a month in a lakeside cabin. In my fantasy, I enter a state of perfect peace and grow my own kale and stuff, but in real life, I think I might be very bored after four days.","I admire my boss, Lorne Michaels. He never stops producing. I think, for him, comedy is a tool of compassion, a way of rallying people together and saying, 'Guys, isn't the world bonkers? Aren't we all just trying our best?' There's a tenderness in everything he does.","I was an umpire at little league softball games. I only lasted a few games because I wasn't one hundred percent clear on all the rules.","To be employed in the entertainment industry is a miracle.","I have no skills. I'm bad at most things.","I do get approached occasionally, but not a ton. I'm unrecognizable because I'm coated in cat hair and sweat. And there's a sort of yeti quality to my presence... so I don't think that people can see the face.","'SNL' can be a stressful environment, and I am panicking constantly, but I guess I keep it pretty internal.","Even when Facebook came out, and I was in college, I found myself never putting anything on it.","I hope to be on 'SNL' as long as they'll let me.","That's the one criteria I have - I can't do an impression of someone I don't like.","It's hard to write a comedy sketch.","Some people look at movies and think, 'Oh my gosh, that's so amazing.' But to me, I look at a politician or a scientist and think, 'They're creating the content of humanity.'","I don't sleep enough, and it does... what is the opposite of wonders... horrors. It does horrors for my skin.","I lost $6 in Atlantic City once and said, 'Never again.'","My cat does this thing where he's so happy to see me that he repeatedly smashes his face into my face and purrs like a literal pig.","I work with some of the funniest writers in the country.","I love doing impressions of politicians because the task is always to imagine the private lives of these people whose job it is to project an image of staunch, unflinching leadership and grace, and that's just not how human beings, in their heart of hearts, work.","You can't make the audience fall in love with a character you don't like.","When I heard that Paul Feig was directing an all-female 'Ghostbusters,' I was prepared to do anything to be a part of this, to be a part of what sounded like an incredible project.","I like to connect with people and suss them out. There's no better way than seeing how they react if you just bear into them.","I can relate to pushing yourself because you want to help and move culture toward justice.","I think that any sort of fantasy or sci fi that is grounded in something that could ostensibly be real - 'Jurassic Park' being my favorite example - is that much more prescient because it means that much more. Maybe one day, what if?","For 'Ghostbusters,' the thing that makes it such an amazing franchise and an amazing idea is that it is adds the element of physics and technology. It's not just about ghosts. Who the heck came up with that? It is such a good idea, such a unique combination of stuff from different genres. Ghosts and sci fi.","I found I could speak louder and was more comfortable if I was doing it in someone else's crazy voice.","Even if you're an angry, intense person, you also have to have intense joy about life and intense feelings about the world.","Everyone has some kind of light inside them.","My most frequent collaborators at S.N.L. are the incredibly gifted writers Chris Kelly and Sarah Schneider!","It just feels unnatural to me to broadcast anything other than the character I've created.","If I had Instagram, it would be pictures of my son, who is a cat.","It's much easier for me to do an impression of someone real, because you and the audience begin with a baseline understanding of this person's life. And then if you subvert that in any way, it's a little comedy surprise.","My couch is made of cat's hair. The cushions have been obscured, and it's made of salt-and-pepper fur. I can't have visitors. I can't ask people to sit on that couch because they become implicated in the furriness of it, and they're walking around, and it's not fair to people.","I have always had eclectic obsessions: astrophysics, music theory, the Mongol empire and its history, and the history of the Silk Road, to name a few.","It's hard not to be the straight man when Zach Galifianakis is there. He's such a delightfully bizarre creature. Everything he does is so surprising. He's such a live wire. It's just so exciting to watch.","'Mean Girls' stands the test of time as one of the greatest comedies ever produced. I've seen it way too many times, and I just think it's the most brilliant thing ever written. I love it so much.","I can't do choreographed movement. It has to come from my heart... and my pelvis.","I have only had positive interactions in relation to my impressions of people, which I'm happy because I do them with love, and I hope that the people who I do them of really like them.","Maddie Ziegler is the most amazing dancer I've ever seen, and I'm so obsessed with her. I was obsessed with her even before she did her first Sia video.","You just have to work super hard, and if you have a passion, that's the most beautiful thing in life, and you just have to bust out and do it, baby!","When I was on 'The Big Gay Sketch Show' I thought, 'Well, this is going well now, but then when it's over I'll just be a barista.'","I had this dream in my head of, if I got hired by 'SNL, what that moment would be like. And I dreamed that I would, like, collapse on the sidewalk and cry to the heavens. I got this call, and it didn't happen naturally. But I did it anyway because I wanted to have that moment. So I did collapse."],"Kate Micucci":["The rule of improvisation I took to heart was, 'Don't think.' I tend to over-think things, so that was a big lesson for me.","I totally had OCD as a teenager. I used to have to touch all four sides of a picture frame when I got home from school and before I started to do my homework. It was time-consuming. But then I just outgrew it, though it sometimes comes back when I'm under a lot of stress.","My parents wanted me to be a teacher. Because I could work most of the year and pursue the things that I love to do during the summer. It just seemed like a good plan.","It's good to make your own things because you can have control of your own art.","I have hair that looks like you could just take it off and plug a new style on.","I never thought of myself as a singer, like ever, ever, ever. It's hysterical that I sing.","I secretly wanted to act. I also wanted be a toy designer and make puppets.","There have been moments where I'm like, 'I don't know how I'm going to survive and pay next month's rent.' And the next month I'm filming a movie in New York City.","I really like doing puppetry; I'm not sure if it will find its way into 'Big Bang,' but it always does seem to find its way into a lot of things.","I babysat kids in a ShopRite, which is a grocery store. They had a babysitting center so that parents could bring their children while they shopped. It was awful. I also was not very good at keeping the kids calm.","When you're buying paintings, it feels grown up.","I'm really shy - I don't do karaoke.","I thought 'Garfunkel and Oates' would be too confusing, but it ended up being confusing in the best of ways because the first time we played a comedy club, it was because they thought we were the real Garfunkel and Oates.","There was always that kind of imagination in our house, which was always a little crazy.","My first songs were about animals and shoes. I wrote one song about PF Flyers, and one to my fish.","Near the end of high school, I was always super shy, backward.","At comedy festivals, we always get grouped with other musical comedians, so you can get to know them and see what everyone is doing. it's really fun and awesome that we're the only girls, because we can tackle issues that guys can't sing about.","I always think that I have plenty of time for everything, and then the reality of it doesn't quite match up.","I used to be obsessed with game shows. When the Game Show Network became popular in the late '90s, I was all about reruns of 'The Price Is Right.' I knew all the prices from the '70s.","My favorite thing to do in a new city is find new fast food. I seek it out. I'll tweet and ask people what their favorite local place is, and if I get four or five with the same answer, then I'll check it out.","I started playing the ukulele in the year 2000. That sounds so futuristic saying it like that. The year 2000.","When I have a bad show, I can't wait until I can get back on stage to forget about it.","My brother and I did theater in high school, and were both in Pennsylvania Youth Theatre. It was awesome. When you go to Los Angeles, it's a rough city, and it's hard. You drive around in your car in your own little bubble, and there's tons of rejection. Being from the Lehigh Valley helped because it was something so stable.","I like the mix of stuff I do. I love movies, but I also enjoy performing live and writing songs.","Doing voices in animated movies has been one of my dreams. You get to go and act, and you don't have to put on makeup.","I've had times where I've joked, like, 'I'm going to move to Vermont and become a painter.' And sometimes that joke felt like, 'Oh that's a good idea.' But it was only, like, a daydream for a moment to, like, escape.","For me, I've always wanted to be a nun. I mean, I think about what it's like to be a nun. And I've always been fascinated with nuns, and I have a nun collection, I've been collecting nuns for 20 years. And I have a song that I wrote, 'I Wanna Be a Nun,' when I was 25.","I guess one that wouldn't be obvious is - well, maybe it's super obvious, I can't tell - 'I Love Lucy' is my favorite show, going back to when I was 4. I've watched every episode I don't know how many times. It was something to watch women being funny when I was young.","I know a lot about Judy Garland. She was born in 1922, and I think she died in '69. When I was little, like, when I was 8, I knew all of her husbands' names.","There was another Judy Garland movie on TV, and it wasn't 'The Wizard of Oz,' and I was so confused. I was like, 'Wait a second, what is Dorothy doing in this movie?' And that's when I became fascinated. I didn't realize there were actors.","I think that's what is so cool about performing. When there is a show to do, you get up there and do it."],"Kate Middleton":["I feel very, very lucky that George has got a little sister.","My parents taught me about the importance of qualities like kindness, respect, and honesty, and I realize how central values like these have been to me throughout my life.","Addiction is a hugely complex and destructive disease, and its impact can be simply devastating. All too often, lives and families can be shattered by it.","Together with open conversations and greater understanding, we can ensure that attitudes for mental health change and children receive the support they deserve.","Around a third of parents still worry that they will look like a bad mother or father if their child has a mental health problem. Parenting is hard enough without letting prejudices stop us from asking for the help we need for ourselves and our children.","The challenge that so many people have is not knowing how to take that first step of reaching out to another person for help.","Yes, well I really hope I can make a difference, even in the smallest way. I am looking forward to helping as much as I can.","Change the way we all talk to each other about our mental health.","There's no one quite like William - I bet he's really kind. You can just tell by looking at him.","A child's mental health is just as important as their physical health and deserves the same quality of support.","There is no rule book, no right or wrong; you just have to make it up and do the very best you can to care for your family.","Well I think if you really go out with someone for quite a long time you do get to know each other very, very well, you go through the good times, you go through the bad times. You know both personally, but also within a relationship as well.","Every child deserves to grow up knowing their potential and feeling confident that they won't fall at the first hurdle - that they cope with life's setbacks.","I can remember being at Sandringham, for the first time, at Christmas. And I was worried what to give the Queen as her Christmas present. I was thinking, 'Gosh, what should I give her?'. I thought, 'I'll make her something.' Which could have gone horribly wrong. But I decided to make my granny's recipe of chutney.","Having a child, particularly your first child, is such a life-changing moment. Nothing can really prepare you for that.","Some children are tackling tough times without the support that can help them because the adults in their life are scared to ask.","I'm still very much Kate.","From taking photographs of George and Charlotte, I have been struck by the wonderful lack of self-consciousness that you see in photographs of children, without the self-awareness that adults generally feel.","All of us know someone who has been through difficult emotional times, and we know how hard it can be to see a way forward.","It is our duty, as parents and as teachers, to give all children the space to build their emotional strength and provide a strong foundation for their future.","I think, the people around home are very supportive to us.","We want to encourage people to talk to one another.","Parents, teachers, and other school staff need the tools to help these young people early in their lives. And the earlier, the better. It is proven that early action prevents problems later in life.","Since beginning my work in areas like addiction, for example, I have seen time and time again that the roots of poor mental health in adulthood are almost always present in unresolved childhood challenges.","We have seen that two heads are better than one when dealing with a mental health problem.","No one would feel embarrassed about seeking help for a child if they broke their arm - and we really should be equally ready to support a child coping with emotional difficulties.","With the right help, children have a good chance of overcoming their issues while they are still young and can have the bright future they deserve.","We need to help young people and their parents understand that it's not a sign of weakness to ask for help.","By far the best dressing up outfit I ever had was a wonderful pair of clown dungarees, which my Granny made.","When I first visited the Hospice in Milton, I had a pre-conceived idea as to what to expect. Far from being a clinical, depressing place for sick children, it was a home. Most importantly, it was a family home, a happy place of stability, support and care. It was a place of fun.","Nothing can really prepare you for you the sheer overwhelming experience of what it means to become a mother. It is full of complex emotions of joy, exhaustion, love, and worry, all mixed together.","I hope we will be able to have a happy family ourselves.","I was lucky. My parents and teachers provided me with a wonderful and secure childhood where I always knew I was loved, valued, and listened to.","Throughout my work with family and child support organizations, one thing that has stood out to me time and again is that getting early support for a child who is struggling to cope is the best possible thing we can do to help our children as they grow up.","When I was growing up, I was very lucky. My family was the most important thing to me. They provided me with somewhere safe to grow and learn, and I know I was fortunate not to have been confronted by serious adversity at a young age.","You go from thinking of yourself as primarily an individual to suddenly being a mother, first and foremost.","Actually William wasn't there for quite a bit of the time initially, he wasn't there for Freshers Week, so it did take a bit of time for us to get to know each other but we did become very close friends from quite early.","I think as any mother would be she was absolutely over the moon. And actually we had quite an awkward situation because I knew and I knew that William had asked my father but I didn't know if my mother knew.","Parenting is tough.","I think there is a real art to walkabouts.","Not all children have the anchor of a strong family.","I think I know I've been working very hard for the family business, sometimes those days are long days and I think if I know I'm working hard and pulling my weight, both working and playing hard at the same time, I think everyone who I work with can see I am there pulling my weight.","No, I had the Levis guy on my wall, not a picture of William, sorry.","I don't know if I have a favorite color.","I was quite nervous about meeting William's father, but he was very, very welcoming, very friendly, it couldn't have gone easier really for me.","It's obviously nerve-wracking, because I don't know the ropes really, William is obviously used to it, but I'm willing to learn quickly and work hard.","I have learned that delivering the best possible palliative care to children is vital, providing children and their families with a place of support, care and enhancement at a time of great need is simply life-changing.","I find doing speeches nerve wrecking.","Around-the-clock support is crucial for children receiving palliative care. They and their families often need help every hour of every day, both in hospices and at home.","First-class delivery of children's palliative care is life-changing. When families are confronted with the shattering news that their children have a life-limiting condition, their world can fall apart.","No parent would fail to call the doctor if their child developed a fever.","I often get asked why I decided to spend time highlighting the mental health of children.","We have heard time and time again in the course of our work how talking can help heal the hidden challenges we can't deal with alone.","It's very special having a new little girl.","Everyone teases me in the family that I spend far too long chatting. So I think I've still got to learn a little bit more and to pick up a few more tips, I suppose.","I am sure you will agree that all children deserve time, attention, and love from the adults in their lives. These basic qualities are so much more valuable than the always-changing material and social concerns that can seem so important to young people.","I feel enormously proud to be part of East Anglia's Children's Hospices and to see the wonderful life-changing work that you do.","Imagine if everyone was able to help just one child who needs to be listened to, needs to be respected, and needs to be loved - we could make such a huge difference for an entire generation.","The most memorable engagement for me, I suppose, was an away-day to Leicester. I went without William, so I was rather apprehensive about that.","Personally, becoming a mother has been such a rewarding and wonderful experience. However, at times it has also been a huge challenge. Even for me who has support at home that most mothers do not.","If any of us caught a fever during pregnancy, we would seek advice and support from a doctor. Getting help with our mental health is no different - our children need us to look after ourselves and get the support we need.","Sadly, for some mothers, this experience can be made so much harder due to challenges with our very mental health.","Every time Wimbledon is on, I am thinking, 'Yes, I could do the same and get out the racket.' Sadly, not the same results.","William and I feel that every child deserves to be supported through difficult times in their lives.","A child who has overcome challenges with proper emotional support will emerge stronger.","Being able to go into Wimbledon and be part of an amazing atmosphere is special.","George loves the T Rex because it's the noisiest and the scariest.","We hope to encourage George and Charlotte to speak about their feelings, and to give them the tools and sensitivity to be supportive peers to their friends as they get older.","The Queen was really thrilled that we'd had a little girl, and when we came back here to Kensington, she was one of her first visitors."],"Kate Millett":["We are women. We are a subject people who have inherited an alien culture.","I'm slammed with an identity that can no longer say a word; mute with responsibility.","A sexual revolution begins with the emancipation of women, who are the chief victims of patriarchy, and also with the ending of homosexual oppression.","This country is becoming increasingly authoritarian. It's based on capital punishment.","Many women do not recognize themselves as discriminated against; no better proof could be found of the totality of their conditioning.","We are naive and moralistic women. We are human beings who find politics a blight upon the human condition. And do not know how one copes with it except through politics.","Politics is repetition. It is not change. Change is something beyond what we call politics. Change is the essence politics is supposed to be the means to bring into being.","The concept of romantic love affords a means of emotional manipulation which the male is free to exploit, since love is the only circumstance in which the female is (ideologically) pardoned for sexual activity.","The great mass of women throughout history have been confined to the cultural level of animal life in providing the male with sexual outlet and exercising the animal functions of reproduction and care of the young.","We're more sexually repressed than men, having been given a much more strict puritanical code of behavior than men ever have.","They are more beautiful than anything in the world, kinetic sculptures, perfect form in motion.","It was horrifying. You wouldn't believe how people are treated there. You could see that these people had withdrawn so far that they just lived in their own minds. They did terrible things to themselves.","What is the natural reaction when told you have a hopeless mental illness? That diagnosis does you in; that, and the humiliation of being there. I mean, the indignity you're subjected to. My God.","You won't do any more housework? Then you go to the bin.","With the first act of cruelty committed in the name of revolution, with the first murder, with the first purge and execution, we have lost the revolution.","Mother had committed me for life. This is where I felt betrayed the most.","Because of our social circumstances, male and female are really two cultures and their life experiences are utterly different.","Isn't privacy about keeping taboos in their place?","However muted its present appearance may be, sexual dominion obtains nevertheless as perhaps the most pervasive ideology of our culture and provides its most fundamental concept of power.","Aren't women prudes if they don't and prostitutes if they do?","As women, we're probably more protective of children. Also, we've been minors all of our history.","Everybody believes in psychiatry; it's supposed to be for our own good. Let psychiatry prove that anybody has an illness, and I'd concede, but there is no physical proof.","I saw hell. The hospital had divided and conquered pretty successfully.","I was supposed to be women's lib, and now I'd exceeded it and gone over into international politics.","In those days, when you got boxed, that was it. A lot of old people were there because somebody wanted the farm. It was about property. People are treated like property.","Men and women were declared equal one morning and everybody could divorce each other by postcard.","My sister said, You're making it hard for all us housewives in Nebraska.","Psychiatry causes so much death.","They weren't crazy. They were tired of being locked up. Even I could see that.","This is how psychiatry has functioned-as a kind of property arm of the government, who can put you away if your husband doesn't like you.","What is our freedom fight about? Is it about the liberation of children or just having sex with them?","What is the future of the woman's movement? How in the hell do I know? I don't run it.","The involuntary character of psychiatric treatment is at odds with the spirit and ethics of medicine itself.","It would appear that love is dead. Or very likely in a bad way."],"Kate Morton":["Some say I'm an overnight success. Well, that was a very long night that lasted about 10 years. But while I do, of course, now feel the pressure having had books that have been very successful, I just know I have to concentrate on writing for myself. I can't worry about genres or markets or what might be commercial or not. That never works.","I write what I'd like to read and just hope that, along the way, others might like to read them, too.","I simply love writing good stories, that's my passion.","People might think writing is a hard business, but it's nowhere near acting.","I love the structural part of the writing process.","There's a market for mysteries for adults. That feeling of opening a book and delving inside and not coming out until you've closed the book.","In retrospect, it seems like everything in my life led to me becoming a writer. I just didn't realise it at the time.","I'd pretty much given up hope of being published, so I just wrote the book I wanted to read."],"Kate Moss":["With confidence, I think anyone can get a dress and make it their own. I don't think you should have it off the runway and wear it like they want you to wear it. You know, with their hair and makeup - their woman. I just think it's boring. You have to make it your own. That's what fashion is all about.","I love the Royal Family. The Queen, she's fabulous.","I want to apologize to all of the people I have let down because of my behavior which has reflected badly on my family, friends, co-workers, business associates and others.","You can be a pretty face, but if you're not a nice person, it just doesn't work. I'm not traditionally a beauty, but apparently people think I'm all right. If you're a nice person, it definitely helps.","I'm happier on the runway than I am on the red carpet. Because then I am not being myself. I think, on the red carpet, it's a weird, like, 'Who am I? Am I me? Am I them?'","No phone, a movie, a glass of wine, and some salad. Perfect!","I'm not really a fashion designer. I just love clothes. I've never been to design school. I can't sketch. I can't cut patterns and things. I can shorten things. I can make a dress out of a scarf.","In my next life, I'm going to be a rock star. I was a ballerina in my last life.","Lipstick is iconic. It's the one product that marks out an era, and a certain lip colour can define a season. It makes me feel more 'done'. I wear a beige lip in the day, but red when I'm going somewhere - it makes that transition from day to night. I just slick it on; I don't bother with lipliner.","I make jam, and oh my God, it is so delicious.","If the plane lost all my luggage, and I was somewhere sunny like Ibiza, I would just get a bikini, shorts, T-shirt, and sandals. If it was somewhere colder like New York, I'd go for jeans, jacket, and a pair of Louboutins.","My signature jam is damson or quince, and it's called 'Kate's Sweet and Sticky'. Basically, I'm a domestic goddess.","Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels.","It's all about the blanket. Blanket, pillow, and red wine. You should always be asleep on a plane.","I love the Sixties with Julie Christie and Jane Birkin - those natural English beauties. That's the look that is most me, when I wore the tight-to-the knee dresses. I don't think I bleached my hair until I was 20. I like experimenting for big occasions, though. You've always got to do a bit of a number for the birthday!","People think your success is just a matter of having a pretty face. But it's easy to be chewed up and spat out. You've got to stay ahead of the game to be able to stay in it.","What people say isn't going to stop me. I have to do things for myself.","I like a scarf with a shirt; it throws it off a bit.","I don't mind a bikini bottom.","Going to the gym wouldn't be on my list of favorite things to do.","If I'm going to work, I put black jeans on, a T-shirt, a shirt, and a jacket.","I was 14 when I started modeling. At the end of that first day my mum said, If you want to do this, you're on your own because I'm not traipsing around London ever again like that. It's a nightmare.","I am so romantic about Gypsies. They're not allowed to do anything until they get married. So they all get married really young, at sixteen.","I wasn't the prettiest girl in class. No breasts, short legs, gangly teeth. I didn't think I was model material, that's for sure.","Even if I wore a hat and a wig, you can always tell it's me.","I own a Hangman jumper, which looks like a scarf, but that's what it's called. It cost a fortune, but it was worth it.","It sounds really corny but I think that if you're beautiful inside it shows on the outside, for sure.","Well, I met Frank Sinatra and Bob Dylan in the space of 15 minutes. Frank Sinatra kissed me on the lips. He kissed me on the lips. And then he gave me a filterless cigarette. And then I met Bob Dylan. I came off all lightheaded and had to go sit on his dressing-room steps.","There are lots of women I look up to, but mentors are someone you talk to and not just admire. A lot of my friends that I trust are my mentors.","Americans are really obsessed with their teeth being white and straight, aren't they? I saw this little girl the other day with one of those whole head braces. Elastic all the way around! How traumatizing for a child to have to wear one of those! You look like a monster.","My daughter Lila loves the smell of gasoline - she always says, 'Mummy, keep the door open,' when I'm filling up the car. I've heard it is one of the most preferred scents in the world - maybe that's something to study for my next fragrance!","Modeling is a job. Even my mum doesn't believe that I do work hard.","Jam! I love my jam. I've just had a batch of it come through, I've been making it.","People don't hear me talk. They don't expect me to.","I was definitely living fast. I was working, traveling a lot, playing. I didn't stop. It all became unbalanced.","I had tried to get focused on other things. But I always ended up back in the same place, and it wasn't making me happy. I needed to get the focus back.","I am not a fashion freak!","I was never anorexic, so I was never that skinny. I was never bony-bony. But I remember thinking, I don't want to be this skinny.","I really work. I like feeling that I've nailed it, and we've got the picture.","I would have wanted to be a rock star, a lead singer, if I wasn't a model. I'd go touring in a bus with my band. In my next life, that's the plan.","It was kind of boring for me to have to eat. I would know that I had to, and I would.","I always take a cashmere blanket, and I have pictures of my family in my passport holder.","I have the whole costume from Playboy's sixtieth-anniversary cover shoot.","My favourite flowers are English country roses - I had a bouquet of them for my wedding.","Topshop is the only brand I've ever collaborated with on a fashion collection.","I have a dress-up chest at home. I love to create this fantasy kind of thing.","Then finally I said, 'Okay, well, I want to know all the details. I want creative input. I want to be consulted. I want to know what they're doing and who's involved. And I want to see the space.' So they took me to see it, and then I realized it was major! All these red flags on the Rue de Rivoli with my name on them right by the Louvre!","It's a sin to be tired.","When people see an actor speak, they think they know him or her, whereas I'm just a face or a body to them.","There's always a dinner to go to. There're always loads of people around. I was having fun working with my friends. For a while it all just kind of rolled together in a great way.","There was a point when it all really took off and got quite overwhelming, even though I didn't realize it.","The first time I went to Johnny Depp's house in LA is when I realized what I was getting myself into. I knew he was famous, but I didn't really know what that entailed.","Now I can walk into a room full of people I don't know and do my job. That's quite a massive thing to learn, I think.","It is quite amazing what I didn't feel after a while. I didn't really want to feel things.","I'll never forget that show season. It was completely mad. I was staying between Christy and Naomi's rooms and it was all limos and the Ritz Hotel and all that kind of business.","I'd go on the train to castings, changing from my school uniform on the train. I carried on like that for a few years, getting jobs in bits and pieces.","I was really nervous, intimidated by the whole thing-all the people and all the buzzing, and all the sitting around waiting. I felt really small in this huge place.","I was amazed at the support that I got when I was in there. And when I came out people knew that I was back on track. I was interested in working again.","I was a scapegoat. The media had to put responsibility on somebody, and I was chosen. They felt free to say that because someone was thin they were anorexic, which is ridiculous.","I thought it was quite vain to say, I want to be a model.","I started going back and forth, New York, London, New York, London. I wasn't looking back at all. I was doing tons of jobs. Working, working, working, working.","I like creating images.","I kind of lost interest in school. I was never really that interested anyway. I was never academic. I didn't really go to school as much as I should have.","I have made some of the best friends that I've got in this business.","Everyone's projecting onto you, or you feel like everyone is judging you. I feel like I'm being judged a lot of the time. You become really self-conscious.","Calvin was very clever. We did the pictures and made the commercial, and that really worked.","All of a sudden to get all of this attention, and to be away from home and working all the time was hard. I was on planes all the time. I didn't see my friends. I cried a lot. It was quite terrifying.","All of a sudden I was living what is perceived to be the model life. It was just full-on, 24 hours a day. It was work all the time. And there's always a party to go to.","Actors do like watching girls parade down the runway for some reason.","I have met almost everyone I've wanted to meet.","Yeah, I like clothes, but I hardly ever go shopping. Hardly ever!","I edit things down, and I've got a massive dressing room in the country, and so all the things I'm not going to wear but don't want to get rid of go there. And all the stuff I want to get rid of goes to Oxfam.","You go to a show, and there's no food at all, so if you're doing shows back to back, you can forget eating. I remember standing up in the bath one day, and there was a mirror in front of me, and I was so thin! I hated it. I never liked being that skinny.","When you're shooting you go to references in your mind. You think about how you should stand in these particular clothes, or how you should move. You think about the different characters you're playing, really.","Modeling can be a bit brain damaging. Starting my own brand was what I needed to do. I only model if there are such good jobs that you don't want to say no to. All that dressing up makes me say, 'What do I want to wear?' and, 'What do I want to do with Topshop?' It all kind of leads into the other things.","Lila can't be a model until she's at least 21. She is already a mini-me - it is scary. She already has her own beauty kit.","Once I was walking from The Mercer in New York - because otherwise I don't walk anywhere - and this woman paparazzo who was following me fell over a fire hydrant and her whole tooth went through her lip. I leant over her, saying, 'Are you all right?' and she was still taking pictures.","Now I'm being blamed not only for anorexia but for lung cancer. - On being a social smoker."],"Kate Mosse":["Library campaigners are not prepared to stand by and watch something they cherish be dismantled brick by brick.","People think that I'm very serious.","I really like people and I keep friendships. I have people from all parts of my life.","Lots of people have objections to prizes of all types, and it would be extraordinary if everybody agreed on anything that's worthwhile - they never do.","People have different views of how you deal with different issues in literature, and, frankly, long may it last that there is a range of views.","All prizes have a role, if they are run with integrity and with a clear focus on reading and quality writing. I don't think any of them is necessary, but they all play an incredibly important role in building a body of literature, in introducing new authors to new readers, and extending reading.","I am not a fan of historical fiction that is sloppy in its research or is dishonest about the real history.","The message is clear: libraries matter. Their solid presence at the heart of our towns sends the proud signal that everyone - whoever they are, whatever their educational background, whatever their age or their needs - is welcome.","Free and fair access to books - to reading - is a right and one we should fight for.","Actually, I can write anywhere - airport lounges, in bed, on a rattling train going north.","I read a lot of thrillers, especially American crime novels.","Usually I decide on what it is I'm writing next by the books I'm reading."],"Kate Mulgrew":["I am often fond of saying the Trekkers are passionate about a hobby, their hobby is 'Star Trek.' They are by and large very imaginative, very intelligent people, and they certainly have been more than generous to me.","I've had young women come to me and say that before they watched 'Voyager' it didn't really occur to them that they could be successful in a higher position in the field of science; girls going to MIT, girls pursuing astrophysics with a view to a career in NASA.","Great writing is great writing. It's as simple as all that.","The elegance and the quality - the talent is always in the literature. I start with the word and I base everything on that. It doesn't make any difference to me.","We are talking about someone who has lived. It must be honored in every respect. The fictional can take any kind of channel - according to the actor's marriage to the character.","Of course, the young male demographic has always been the target demographic for 'Star Trek,' the men ageing fifteen to about twenty-five or thirty, a very tough market to appeal to.","It's not refreshing where there is confusion or any kind of discomfort in a group that has to work that closely together.","Life is sacred to me on all levels. Abortion does not compute with my philosophy.","Execution as punishment is barbaric and unnecessary.","I have a very rich and wonderful personal life, and at its core are my sons."],"Kate O'Brien":["Everywhere I go I'm asked if I think the university stifles writers. My opinion is that they don't stifle enough of them.","A laugh is a terrible weapon.","If it bends, it's funny; if it breaks, it's not funny.","Hmmm... I never get the answer I think I'm going to get.","I only use my sick days for hang-overs and soap opera weddings.","If somebody on this team actually gets to first base, I'll stand there naked.","My mom always said that if the Protestants catch a Catholic in their church, they feed them to the Jews.","It's filled with... baking soda. Because it really smells."],"Kate O'Mara":["When eating out while on tour, a great place to get vegetarian food is Thai restaurants, as they have lots of options. I absolutely adore salad and vegetables - I will eat salad until it's coming out of my ears. Although I think it's great in any form, my particular favourite has to be beetroot salad.","I've always been unhappy with my teeth. I've lost most of them from my bottom jaw, and those in the upper jaw have been screwed in or capped. As a result, I've got great hollows under my cheeks, and my bone structure seems accentuated.","I am fortunate in having this bone structure because I have a tremendously prominent temple. I like to think that's it's because I'm so intelligent. People say: 'You haven't got a line on your forehead.' I do. It's just the bones are holding them all out, and the cheekbones are holding my face up.","I never drink cow's milk; I always opt for the soya alternative, and when I eat most dairy products, it tends to be in extremely small doses. However, being a vegetarian means I have to get protein from somewhere, so I do eat eggs and cheese about once a week.","I would like to be where Diana Rigg or Judi Dench is, but I expect it is as good as it is going to get.","Whenever I get on stage, I feel safe and in control. Life can be so uncertain, but on stage, I always know how a drama or crisis is going to end. Acting is a great comfort blanket and has gotten me through countless personal crises. I am a firm believer that the show must go on.","I have white hair now, but a lot of it, and I'm still very glamorous, and so I won't disappoint, I hope! I'll still be wearing the tight leather trousers and high-heel boots, regardless of what age!","On the whole, I have quite a low opinion of men.","Ignorance of the facts of life gave me my beloved son, Dickon, but at what cost to both him and me, I cannot hazard a guess.","If you put a much older woman in 'Doctor Who,' they can identify with it. I think it's quite an interesting concept, and if you remember things like 'Grimm's Fairytales,' the older woman is often the villainess, often the terrifying figure - why I do not know, but often she is. I think it's an idea to be exploited.","I'm still a size 10, but it's the toning that's getting me down, and I think it can only get more difficult as I get older. Either one gets very thin and scrawny, or one puts on poundage; I'm definitely not going to pile on the pounds, so I can expect to end up scrawny.","Probably the only type of cosmetic surgery I'd consider is having my bust reduced. It's alright for my current role in 'The Marquise' because it's a costume drama, which means boned corsets and a bit of cleavage, but it's a drag otherwise.","Because my career has been based so much on my looks, when I finally pass my 'sell-by' date, I think I'll probably pack it in. Unless I make the changeover into playing witches or something, I don't see what career I can have.","I was asked to do 'I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here,' and I said: 'No thank you.'","I used to play a lot of foreign women in my youth because I was prettier then. I would go for interviews, and directors would look at these sultry, exotic looks, hear this clipped accent and think the two don't go together. So they would give me a foreign accent.","I have tried Botox, and I don't like it because it stops you being able to move your facial muscles which, as an actress, are essential. But I do have collagen injections.","I'm actually quite a nice person. It's to do with the way I look, an uncompromising sort of face, brusque delivery and voice, and I think the combination of all that. When I'm doing pantomime, children will scream the place down before I open my mouth. There's obviously something that really gets them.","I love the Wendy Syred boutique in Taunton. She has fantastic off-the-wall stuff, such as Vivienne Westwood. And I always have huge success in Omah Shoes, which is also in Taunton. I've got such small feet - three and a half - but I always find my size there.","I have very long, wild hair, a suntan and wear knee high boots and ignore all the rules about what you should or shouldn't wear at whatever age.","I'm vegetarian and stick to a strict health regime of brown rice, tofu, salads and soya milk. When I'm at home in Somerset, I buy almost everything in the local farmshops including Barleymow's in Chard. I always get organic - I like happy hens.","I've been vegetarian for virtually all of my adult life, and I do adopt a very strict health regime.","I never have cakes or biscuits. I don't have a sweet tooth at all, and I can't stand chocolates - I find them so sickly. However, I will buy cakes if I'm expecting company.","What really interests me is how a woman who has had a bad experience with a man comes through it and gets a new life. I feel you have to be positive. You have to say, 'Look, okay, he's ditched you, but there's life after.'","I try to write about a woman finding her self-respect, valuing herself, and liking herself again. But what one desperately wants now is to write a proper novel.","Why should anyone be interested in my life? It's the prurience I find so extraordinary. Why, why, oh why should my private life be of any interest to the public? The only people who should be interested are my friends.","Shakespeare is where I live. I adore him.","I knew 'Bad Girls' attracts a younger audience, and it's vital to get oneself known to that audience because, unless they watch me in re-runs on 'U.K. Gold,' they won't know me from a hole in the ground.","I enjoy producing because the show becomes your baby.","The ghastly thing about being a producer is that, once the curtain goes up, there is nothing you can do. At least when you are in it, you have some measure of control. If something goes wrong, you can maybe put it right. When you are in the audience, there is nothing you can do.","The trouble with some cooking is that the real flavours get cancelled out by the wine, cream, and butter sauces."],"Kate Reardon":["My favourite thing in my wardrobe is my jewelry.","It doesn't matter how many A-levels you have, what kind of a degree you have, if you have good manners, people will like you.","There's a difference between being posh and being rich.","Being chaotic isn't cute.","Polo drifts gently in and out of fashion.","Anya Hindmarch is indeed a handbag designer; she has the requisite fabulous life, tasteful home, and loving husband. She is also beautiful and self-deprecating, and has five children aged 5 to 20 and a philanthropic bent which spans causes from cancer care to Britain's Conservative Party.","Posh is a way of living that can often be quite miserly and not about money.","No matter how irrelevant social class now is, even the most eager egalitarian must be quietly proud that the posh English rose is still an industry standard for peerlessly sophisticated beauty.","A good education gives you confidence to stick up your hand for anything - whether it is the job you want, or the bloke. And the more you stick up your hand, the better your chances are that you will get what you want.","A good school teaches you resilience - that ability to bounce back.","There's no snobbery or resentment from serious polo people towards those who just come for the party.","I can count on one hand the number of people who wrote me a thank you letter after having an interview, and I gave almost all of them a job.","Luck is going to play a huge part in your life.","The Queen's wedding dress in 1947, there was some embroidery on the train which was definitely there to illustrate new dawn/post-war optimism, that sort of thing.","The trouble with glossy magazines is that they tend to be stuffed with articles about handbag designers - the sort of women who, with their perfectly styled lives, immaculate houses, and adoring partners, make you want to become a hermit.","Anything looks good if you've got the body of a Victoria's Secret model and the porelessly smooth skin-tone of a piece of glass.","Conrad Black is a picture of a man hugely enjoying himself.","Each dress symbolizes the age that it's appropriate for.","The genius of Kate Middleton is that she hasn't gone too far. She's still dressing in a way that people can relate to.","A lot of women find that their workwear acts as armour.","Personal shoppers in big department stores are seriously under-used.","It's stupid to say that there's any comfort to be had in 'knowing your place,' but there is a sense of reassuring escapism to something like 'Downton Abbey.' There's a perceived romance and elegance that is wonderful to lose yourself in.","I think, to me, the sheer joy of fancy dress is that it allows you to take a break from our very carefully considered and constructed identities.","When did you last have fun being dignified?","By doing, you become employable. It doesn't matter what the job is; by working, you learn new things, meet new people and are exposed to new ideas.","The way you personally communicate is 90 per cent of how you will be evaluated by any future employer.","There's a particularly British wariness of appearing to try too hard. It's somehow distasteful. Everything should come to us seamlessly and, if you have to work at it, you're somehow a loser.","I have a career I love more than I can tell you, and I have it because I work incredibly hard pretty much every single day.","There is something enormously compelling about Fran Cutler. She is a thrilling bundle of energy and enthusiasm.","If you develop just one muscle, one skill, make it the ability to focus and just get on with it. It will not only make you desirably employable, but it will make you happy.","Every time I put on high heels, I think: 'Well, I'll fall over today.' Almost always, I don't. Almost. But all high-heel-wearing women live in constant peril.","In falling over in heels while trying to look attractive, you don't just hurt your body, you bear the humiliation of injuring your very soul. Physical pain? Whatever, bring it on. But the humiliation? Oh, you have seen to the very weakest part of me.","Public humiliation comes to us all, and never so surely as when we're just a little bit pleased with ourselves and feel, just for once, that everything is going our way.","As someone who works from home, my top style tip is to make sure you get dressed in the morning.","I have a beautiful Hellenistic gold and garnet ring - it's more than 2,200 years old, but it looks very modern.","When you first hear the name 'Max Irons,' you'd be forgiven for assuming that Marvel comics has come up with a new superhero.","The modern world is a meritocracy where you earn your own luck, old school ties count for nothing, and inherited privilege can even lose a guy a clear parliamentary majority.","The Mark Birley fan club, of which epic American socialite Nan Kempner says she's the oldest living member, follows him doggedly."],"Kate Seredy":["Kill the snake of doubt in your soul, crush the worms of fear in your heart and mountains will move out of your way.","There are hurts so deep that one cannot reach them or heal them with words.","For yesterday and for all tomorrows, we dance the best we know.","I make money using my brains and lose money listening to my heart. But in the long run my books balance pretty well."],"Kate Smith":["If rock-and-roll is well done, there's nothing so terribly wrong with that kind of music. But the lyrics are another story.","Middle-aged women have greater stability, they are more loyal, and their capacity for steady work is greater than that of younger women.","There's no second chance on stage, and I was trained to make the most of my first chance.","Ice cream was my undoing, and six chocolate milk shakes in a row were nothing to me at one time.","I was always daydreaming about singing in big productions on Broadway.","This nation loves singing and loves acting.","Since I have been singing for so many years, I don't always need to approach a song quite so laboriously and meticulously.","Public and employer opinion often defeat society's best interests with a prejudice against middle-aged women.","My singing is part of me, like my stoutness, or my light hair, or my poor eyesight.","Most of the people who act and sing do so for their own pleasure and that of their friends and family.","Many people submit to excessive appetites without realizing that they do not need to eat so much food.","It's up to the audience. It always has been.","It is important that the audience should understand every syllable of every word, for only then can they grasp the meaning of the song.","It became obvious in 1957 that I was endangering my health by carrying so much weight.","Intelligent analysis of the composer's intention and strict adherence to it automatically ensures sincerity.","In nearly all ballads, the words set the mood and meaning, while the music intensifies or enhances them.","In 29 years, I had recorded over 2,200 songs. I was amazed.","I vowed that whenever my family needed me, I would give up everything to go to them, no matter what. The show must go on was meaningless to me.","I sometimes get that wonderful sympathy between me and the audience, telling me I've reached their hearts. And when I do, the thrill is mine.","I shall always respect the composer. If I embellish, it is his idea I am embellishing.","I must work hard to make my singing above reproach; there must be no faults which hard work would take care of.","I learn my songs by ear.","I know I'm fat and I know my hair is straight, but I can sing.","I just can't read music.","I have personally believed in every product I have ever advertised.","I have never known stage-fright at any time.","I have been extremely lucky with reviewers and critics throughout my career.","I have always examined closely the motives of any group for which I am asked to raise money.","I could see myself in a white nurse's uniform, working unnoticed for many years and at last dying, unknown, unmarried and unsung.","I could not separate myself off stage from myself on stage, as so many actors can.","I am harder on myself than anyone else could be.","I am exceedingly lucky that my voice, along with perfect pitch and perfect rhythm, was given me at birth.","I am continually embarrassed by people who point me out as an example of what can be done without training.","Every small town has its dramatic group, its barber-shop quartet, every home has music in one form or another.","During the presidential primaries of 1940, I received a request from the Democratic National Committee to sing God Bless America before the speeches.","Because of my voice, speaking words which had been carefully chosen, women had used money they had set aside for other purposes to buy war bonds.","As soon as I began to earn what might be called fairly large sums, I bought a car and began to explore the country around New York.","An entertainer should in his public performance keep himself out of any controversy, political or otherwise."],"Kate Spade":["I was preppy, then suddenly switched around age 14. I asked my mother to go to this vintage store, and she let me buy a leopard swing coat, pink cigarette pants, and lime-green gloves.","I like my stationery to be funnier, like, 'Here's my note, and it's an elephant with a lady smoking a cigarette on top.'","I love lamps. I can't stand overhead lighting. I have to have everything on a dimmer.","No one realizes how hard parenthood is. I am not saying going into the office is easy. It's not. But parenthood, as fun as it is, is not for the fainthearted.","I buy so much fake jewelry, it's funny. It's not real. I don't wear real diamonds or anything.","I remember someone once said there is a practical aspect to my designs, and I remember thinking, 'That doesn't sound so creative,' but that is actually the truth. There is a practicality to it. I don't design just to design. There is a reason and, hopefully, an interesting reason behind it - that is where my creativity comes in.","I like a full house because it's how I grew up. I'm one of six children.","People have this impression that I'm a little kooky, but I'm actually very OCD. I love order and organization. I'm a big list maker. But if I cross off too many tasks, and it's hard to see the remaining ones, I have to start a new list. Now that's OCD.","I collect books - a lot of books.","I'm admittedly not that into the Internet.","Before I came to New York, I only had a few pictures of the city in my mind. And you know 'That Girl?' Marlo Thomas jumping with her hat? I always loved that, and I wondered what that double street she crosses is. And it's Park Avenue! And that's what I can see out my window.","Every time I go to the market, Andy says, 'Don't forget the Triscuits!'","The idea of recklessly spending money - even though it sounds like it's lots of fun, it's fashion - isn't interesting to me. It is a business.","I love Comme des Garcons. I think everything she touches is almost like gold. And she does it so quietly. No branding.","Starting at 11, I was a movie-theater popcorn girl, a babysitter, a sales clerk - in the Midwest, they start them early!"],"Kate Thompson":["I've always felt a bit hard done by in England - you know, I've won the Bisto three times in Ireland, but it has felt like nobody has even heard of me in my home country.","My mum wouldn't have had any time for fantasy stuff; she's more practical.","I always had an awful lot going on in my head, always telling myself stories, very vivid imagination.","I am political. But not politically active. I'm not my dad. I'll never write polemic, as he did.","There's only one set of books I've written that I knew was going to be more than one book at the beginning, and those are the 'Missing Link' books.","I came to writing because I joined the North Clare Writers' Workshop, which met every week at Ennistymon Library.","What I tend to get from America is very enthusiastic letters and e-mail from librarians and schoolteachers, the gatekeepers, though I hesitate to use that word. I've never been a huge seller.","What I do find enormously gratifying is the reviews my books get from the American press. They are so on the ball compared to anywhere else. It's so satisfying to get a review that conveys the reader understood precisely what I was trying to get at.","Irish mythology is gorgeous, and so are the fairies, but they are very misrepresented in the U.K. They are not little creatures with wings.","If there's a common thread to my books, it is that each involves an individual's journey. The individual must stay true to themselves.","Children in their young teens are just moving into the moment when they are most receptive to philosophy and psychology. You can explore these things in stories and, in doing so, give them power and control.","The powerlessness of the child is often forgotten. And after it comes the terrifying phase of moving into adulthood.","My first book was an adult novel, 'Down Among the Gods,' published by Virago, and I've written poems as well, a slim volume of poetry.","I had thought about becoming a civil rights lawyer, but I gave it up.","I wasn't that bothered with school; I was too mad into horses. But I liked reading and was good enough at English and always liked music.","You know yourself, once you've had the excitement of riding thoroughbreds, it's not very interesting riding anything else. But I still love horses; I just don't have one any more.","Writers want publicity all the time, and they are always nagging their agents and publishers to give them more publicity, but, when you get it, it's kind of soul-destroying.","I found it really hard for a couple of years to do any writing because all I wanted to do was play the fiddle. From the minute I took it up, I just couldn't put it down.","I find it very difficult to say no when I'm in Ireland. You do end up going around doing lots of events and things and not getting work done, and it's not just a question of having hours at the desk.","If I have one thing on in a week, I find it very difficult to get back to work that week. I need a lot of dreaming time."],"Kate Upton":["You have to think hard with a tattoo. 'What will I love for the rest of my life?'","I don't ever want to be a person that I'm not. A lot of girls fall into the trap where they are trying to impress other people, and that's the time when they lose themselves.","I can't change my bra size. They're natural! I can work out and I can stay healthy and motivated, but I can't change some things. I really just live my life. I love my body. It's what God gave me! I feel confident with myself, and if that inspires other women to feel confident with their bodies, great.","I think it's very hard to find a good friend. That's why I'm so lucky to have two sisters, because they're my best friends, and they have to be with me forever. They're stuck with me.","I'm not going to starve just to be thin... I want to enjoy life and I can't if I'm not eating and miserable.","I was at a photo shoot, and I was wearing a cross necklace that my mom bought me, and somebody made a joke like, 'Why are you wearing a cross? Like you would be religious.' And then they took it away. I was really affected by that. The whole thing made me realize that I do want a cross with me at all times.","I hate exercising self-control.","I would love to have my own lingerie line.","After my first 'Sports Illustrated' cover, I felt terrible about myself for a solid month. People deal with models like they are children. They think they can pull one over on you. I'm not a toy; I'm a human. I'm not here to be used.","I always had career goals. And I figured out a path I wanted to take to accomplish those goals. If that meant calling the best modeling agency in the world, that's what it meant.","So if I get pegged as a bikini girl, that's fine, and that can still translate into acting or other areas. But, no, I don't wanna be doing bikini shoots my whole life.","I'm actually an equestrian, and I showed in the American Paint Horse Association and competed for top 20 in the nation.","I want to be able to sing well, but I have the worst voice in the world.","I just think that pick-up lines in general are horrible. None of them work.","I'm hoping they slow down a little bit with technology, because I'm just trying to keep up.","My mom is from Texas, but I was raised in Florida.","I can never find the right bras.","I grew up in Florida riding horses, so for the majority of my life I was either in boots and jeans or a bathing suit.","Anywhere in life, for girls there's pressure to keep your weight and to keep yourself feeling and looking good.","If I can help and influence girls who are going through body-image issues then I think that's amazing.","I'm sure every designer has a certain person in mind who they would ideally like to wear their clothes, but the problem is that a lot of the time that person doesn't actually exist, unless she is a 15-year-old model.","My dream was always to be on the cover of 'Sports Illustrated.'","So, I have my own horse and two ponies. I grew up around horses, and that really is my passion.","I've always loved fashion, but it's not what I set out to do.","I think the fame aspect, there was definitely a period when I had to get used to it. My family had to get used to it, too. It's exciting.","I think twerking is overrated.","I have a paralyzing fear of snakes.","Listen: I like my bikinis very small, and I also like, uh, nude-colored bikinis because people double-take - they think I'm naked on the beach.","My mom played every sport possible. My dad is 'extremely' competitive. You can't even play Ping-Pong with him.","People deal with models like they are children. They think they can pull one over on you. It's actually funny. I'm always like, I'm about to pull something on you, and you're so focused on thinking I'm dumb, you're not even going to know."],"Kate Voegele":["Believing in yourself and what you do is so important. It took me a long time to find that confidence. If you're an artist and you're taking risks, then you're doing something right if some people don't get it.","Music is such a healing thing, no matter who you are.","I know who I am as an artist and I know what my sound is, but I wanted to know what I could do in order to take it to that next level. So the experiences I had last year of moving to California and traveling to places like Rome and Nicaragua where I met a lot of people just had a really big impact in my life.","As you get older, challenges arise that you aren't prepared for, but what got me through it was music.","I like to perform live like we're all just hanging out in my living room. I'm totally casual and informal on stage.","My biggest advice for girls - and this is something that I wish I could have known when I was younger - is to have thick skin. It's something that you definitely develop when you get older, but when I first started, I was so obsessed with pleasing everybody. I wanted everybody to like me and to like my songs.","Working as a musician, I have to constantly generate new material, so school keeps me sharp. Reading and writing all the time helps me to be a better songwriter.","The first record I spent five years writing and it was an amalgamation of all the things that happened in my life from the time I was fifteen to the time I was twenty.","My second album was written while I was on the road promoting the first record. I tried to take my personal experiences and elevate them to universal experiences, so that I wasn't writing songs about living on a tour bus or being on a TV set for the first time.","I started playing guitar and writing songs when I was 15. I think what mainly sparked my interest was just the fact that I grew up listening to Cheryl King, Joni Mitchell, and James Taylor, and was just always inspired by that sort of organic art, and organic songs and just very natural songwriting that came out of some of those artists.","I think just being on 'One Tree Hill' has given me a lot of confidence.","I think the most challenging part of being a performer is just making sure that people know that when you get up there every night, it's unique and that you care.","I've always been a really really big Sheryl Crow fan. I just respect what she does in a way that she just remains true to her music and sort of has just been real. She isn't trying too hard ever.","I knew that going on 'One Tree Hill' was going to be an incredible vehicle for the record. What is amazing about it is that my role on the show is, you know, basically playing a musician, and all the songs she plays are off my record.","My main goal as a songwriter is to make something that inspires people. To write things about my life that people can relate to. Whether it's a whole record or just one song for someone, I hope it can do that for them. Knowing that I have the ability to do that is inspiring to me.","I can lick my elbow. I know that's supposed to be impossible, but I can do it!","I never thought then I'd be doing what I'm doing now. At my high school, being on the girls soccer team was the cool thing to do, but that was definitely never going to happen for me, so I played music. Not because everyone thought it was awesome, but for the love of it.","Being on the road is like a campout. I'm the only girl. The guys in my band are like my big brothers. It's definitely an adventure, but it can be a nomadic lifestyle.","Acting and singing on 'One Tree Hill' was definitely one of the most incredible experiences of my life. I didn't even know I could act until I auditioned at the casting call for the part of Mia.","I've always had a bazillion songs in my archive, but I want to play people stuff they know. Now that I have two albums' worth of material, that gives me freedom to compose a set that's more well-balanced and build a show rather than just a recital of some songs.","More than anything I want to get up there and hang out with the audience, make everybody feel like it's fun and they're involved and are just, like, friends hanging out in somebody's living room. I went to see Carole King on her 'Living Room' Tour, and that's the kind of feeling I'm aiming for.","My music is the chicken soup kind. I want people to get a good feeling in their soul from these songs. Roots rock, heartland rock... whatever you want to call it is OK with me.","I used to bring my sketchbook to gym class and doodle, because I am a very uncoordinated athlete.","I always try to be very human in my performances and hang out with my fans. It is cool to be a celebrity, but at the end of the day I want to empower my audience and say, 'Hey, I am just like you.'","I am very busy and don't have a lot of down time, but I write my best songs in those situations. I enjoy my life the most when I have a bunch of things going on at the same time.","I consider myself a songwriter before anything else. The fact that I have been able to write both of my records and establishing myself as a songwriter is super-important to me. Some people have that gift, where they can take on anything and make people believe it. I like to do a song from personal experience.","I am definitely still the same kid that I was picking up the guitar at 15. But, I have definitely learned to be more flexible and roll with the punches. It's such an unpredictable business to be in and it's insane how things change so last minute."],"Kate Walsh":["My very first job was a cashier at Burger King in Tucson, Arizona. And I occasionally worked the drive-thru. I'd go wherever I was needed! My second job was at Dairy Queen. I stayed in the fast food royalty.","I've learned over and over that life happens on its own terms, not mine.","I've got four roommates and they all have fur and tails.","You never want to rest on your laurels. You want to keep doing things that terrify you.","I'm stronger and sassier as a redhead.","I don't need someone with a hot body. He can be fat or overweight and have a belly. It's very much about style and substance and humor, interest, curiosity and really being smart.","People always say you can't do a red lip if you have red hair but I've never shied away from it. I think you can absolutely do that. It's more about hair colour and complexion.","No matter what job you do, we all have a much different life than our parents had. My parents' generation had one job and then they retired. Now, people have many different jobs.","I have always been the girl who keeps on trying. I try! I try!","For me, my 20s were all about reaching for the brass ring of work in theater, television, and film, surviving in between by waiting tables, painting houses, serving coffee, and temping.","I do Pilates, and hike with my dog.","I still like to make crank calls.","My mother is Italian and my dad's Irish. In my family, we're expressive. Nobody holds back.","I loved campaigning for Obama.","Sometimes I hope that through osmosis I might get a workout - just by wearing the clothes.","I've done every diet there is.","I struggle with control.","I'm not a clean freak. My house is a mess.","Age is just a number. Unless, that is, you live in Hollywood, where there's this notion that if you haven't hit it big by your 20s, you may as well hit the road.","Acting was all I ever really wanted to do.","I don't like to take a lot of stuff since I'm really sensitive to medications.","I drink tons of water. When you're puffy, you think you can't drink water since you feel more bloated and gross but that's what you do to get the toxins out of your system. I put a little lemon in the water bottle that I carry around with me or drink a cup of hot water with lemon. It's a natural diuretic.","There are lots of different ways for women to be a mom in this culture.","I like to eat right and in moderation, but give myself treats and kind of have everything.","I would definitely love to be a parent.","I'm lucky. I've got pretty good genes.","I used to skip breakfast, but eating gets my metabolism going, so I burn more calories all day.","I try to cook dinner, but it's difficult when I'm working.","I don't think anyone gets married thinking that they will get divorced.","I second-guess myself all the time. I make a decision and then wonder if I made the wrong choice.","My mom, she's a breast cancer survivor and because of that I had started getting mammograms once a year, starting at age 30.","I think a lot of people just aren't aware how young you can be and be diagnosed with breast cancer."],"Kate Williams":["The modern museum has multiple purposes - to curate and preserve, to research, and to reach out to the public. They challenge us and ask us to question our assumptions about the past or the world around us.","Some archives and record offices are housed in your local museum or library; others have their own stand-alone building. Wherever they are, they are a treasure trove.","I like boxes because of the secrets they hide.","Precise historical reasons are difficult to pinpoint, but red hair, it seems, bestows a sense of otherness. Red is the colour of blood and danger.","Analysis of soil, grave goods and skeletons has been key to our understanding of archaeology and the migration of peoples, as well as their daily lives. But in mainstream history, we tend to stick to documents.","Over the years to come, one thing is for certain: if the monarchy wishes to stay relevant and in power, it will have to change more.","People are not happy with women in actual power, yet we seem to be happy to take women on as figureheads, objects, like queens. It's a powerful yet politically powerless role.","I've written extensively on Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth and seen up close how those women, who were born when the country hoped for a male heir, made their way as leaders.","Colour is really important to me when buying clothes. I wear a lot of fitted jackets, and because I'm small, I avoid long skirts and coats. And I hate wearing hats.","Between 1945 and 1965, the number of colonial people ruled by the British monarch plunged from 700 million to five million. In 1956, just three years after the coronation, the Suez canal crisis and Anthony Eden's humiliation ended all notions that Britain was a world superpower.","My Welsh grandmother Mair didn't meet my grandfather until she was 28, quite old to be unmarried in the early '40s.","I've always considered myself to look like a rather plain-and-exhausted bluestocking, so it's rather odd to read Tweets commenting on my appearance.","One woman came up to me at a lecture and observed that I was much fatter than on television; I think I look better onscreen than in real life. It's the lights.","I think increasingly we want to read the history that wasn't written by the victors.","I really enjoy watching TV; it offers an amazing window, and its an incredible way of presenting history to young people in particular.","When I was a child, one of my first games was a time machine which I made for my brother - a big box covered in silver and bits of cellophane. I'd close him up in it and joggle him and say, 'We're in Victorian times now... and now we're in Egyptian times, and I can see all these pyramids and pharaohs.'","It's the 21st century. It's untenable to suggest that women had no significance and no interest and that just because they didn't vote they had no relevance to the course of our history.","I wonder if there'll ever be a time where you're not judged by your appearance. It seems that wherever you've got to, your appearance is always discussed. It's never said about men. We talk about a man's charisma, not his looks.","I'm fascinated by historical fashion, and I like to live in the past slightly. If I could walk around all day dressed in a crinoline, I would.","I love wearing green, and I like grey and black, but I don't think they really suit me.","Unless I'm asked to dress up in a costume, TV shows prefer a clean, modern look, so I've developed a wardrobe full of plain, bright colours. If it's an outdoors job, I just wear big jumpers.","Women's stories have been neglected for so long - unless they were queens. Exploring the history of women is a way of redressing that imbalance.","I wouldn't mind an original letter from Napoleon to Josephine - in the early days, his letters arrived torn to pieces because he was overwhelmed by his passion for her.","Now I would go to London's Pudding Lane on 2 September 1666 and put out that little fire. I'd love to investigate the histories of a few of the buildings that burned for Restoration Home.","When Elizabeth II was crowned - the sixth female monarch since the Norman conquest - the world lit up in her favour.","One of Britain's big problems throughout history has been that we lust after consumer goods from elsewhere, but our friends overseas have been less enthusiastic about buying things we produce.","British passion for Chinese tea was unstoppable, but the Chinese had no desire for our offerings, however much we tried to sell them woolen clothes or cutlery.","Throughout the 19th century, Britain bought cheaply from the countries of the empire and compelled subject countries to buy our goods at high prices.","Visit any bookshop in Europe, and the shelves are filled with English novels and non-fiction books in translation - while British bookshops stock mainly English and American works.","As an older child, I was a huge 'Anne Of Green Gables' fan.","I am part of a team organising an Emma Hamilton exhibition for the National Maritime Museum for 2016, and the amount of planning is a revelation - borrowing from museums and collections all over the world.","The British Museum was our first real museum, the property of the public rather than the monarch or the church.","The 19th century became the age of the museum. Objects were scrambled for, specimens seized, and friezes and antiques grasped.","The motivations of kings in British history can generally be reduced to two: the quest for territory and the search for a male heir. No king was secure on his throne until he had a son, and no queen consort was ever really safe without a boy.","The centuries-old habit of privileging the male heir arose because monarchs were supposed to lead their country in battle, and only men were thought strong enough to do so.","Queens perhaps perform better in the role of monarch because they never take their position for granted. Many kings have failed because they believed that the public would love them whatever they did. Queens knew better.","Indeed, throughout much of history and in many cultures, redheads have been viewed with suspicion and fear - and even killed - because of their hair.","Redheads were particularly persecuted during the European witch trials of the fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The colour was associated with the devil, and the pale skin which most redheads have was thought unnatural and deathly.","Eighteenth-century matrons would have never have dreamed of appointing a redhaired wet nurse for their precious offspring - redheads passed on their horrible characters through their milk.","Anglo-Saxon kings often used to favour their sister's son to their own - for at least you could guarantee there was your own blood in your sister's son!","Usually, historical revelations come from days of legwork, ploughing through piles of letters and papers in archives or even private homes, looking for the telling phrase or letter that someone else has missed.","As historians, we spend days in archives, gazing at account books. We train would-be historians in the arts of deciphering letters and documents, early Latin, scribal handwriting, medieval French.","I receive many letters from people hoping to research their own houses.","One child is never enough for a monarch.","Throughout history, the only way to secure a throne has been with a phalanx of children - nine for Victoria, 13 for George III.","Are we really so far from the Victorians? Much of what our society holds important was shaped in the 19th century.","Britain's passion for Christmas and huge white weddings dates from Victorian times - both were low-key celebrations before Victoria and her PR machine.","Still often interventionist, convinced of our importance in the world, even those of us born long after 1900 live in a country that is much more Victorian than we think.","I chose my house because I loved the fact that there was a really busy road with lots of things to stare at.","I used to hate reading my old work, but now I'm rather fond of it. I quite like going through it in the hope of making it better."],"Kate Winslet":["The good and bad things are what form us as people... change makes us grow.","The things that make me happiest in the whole world are going on the occasional picnic, either with my children or with my partner; big family gatherings; and being able to go to the grocery store - if I can get those things in, I'm doing good.","Life is short, and it is here to be lived.","It's very easy to be judgmental until you know someone's truth.","I'll eat one cookie, not a whole box of cookies. But I'll still eat the one cookie... sometimes two, or even three. But not the whole box.","One thing I love about being back is English rain. Looking out of the window now, it's raining, and the sky is dark; I love it. To me, those are reassuringly English things. I love it when it rains.","Thank God I'm in touch with my emotions enough to be able to pick up my children, kiss them all over and say 'I love you' over and over.","I often look at women who wear great jeans and high heels and nice little T-shirts wandering around the city, and I think, 'I should make more of an effort. I should look like that.' But then I think, 'They can't be happy in those heels.'","Growing up, I had a very happy childhood, with two parents who are still very much together.","Glamour to me is about remaining graceful and understated.","Ah... romance to me is spontaneity. It's not diamond earrings; it's a bunch of daffodils that's freshly picked from the field.","No one can look bad when you've been lit for six hours.","I need to be looked after. I'm not talking about diamond rings and nice restaurants and fancy stuff - in fact, that makes me uncomfortable. I didn't grow up with it, and it's not me, you know. But I need someone to say to me, 'Shall I run you a bath?' or 'Let's go to the pub, just us.'","I love the routine. I love getting up in the morning and getting breakfast and packing lunches and doing the school run. Those things are really important to me. Because I think that those small but key moments are crucial for a kid.","My life has taken me down several different paths I never expected it to take me down. Not in a million years.","I think heartbreak is something that you learn to live with as opposed to learn to forget.","Plastic surgery and breast implants are fine for people who want that, if it makes them feel better about who they are. But, it makes these people, actors especially, fantasy figures for a fantasy world. Acting is about being real being honest.","It's true that you need much time to get rid of the fat girl you once were, but you know I am sincerely grateful for my buttocks.","I'm often drawn to characters that are more obviously one thing. They're passionate, and there is always an element of strength because I think every person possesses that in some way, even if they've experienced hardship in their lives.","What I am very, very moved and struck by is that so many people in the world are often living a life that they hadn't planned for themselves. And they wake up one day and say, 'Hang on. Who am I? Is this really me? Is this what I really wanted?' And also, 'Can I change it? Have I got the courage to change it?'","I want to end up like Judi Dench. I want to have nice consistent work, doing lovely things, no matter how big or small they might be. I'd like to turn into a wise old thing.","Sure, I could have lots of people who do the cooking, the driving, all that jazz - but I would be unhappy. I wouldn't want my children raised that way.","I was living in my lovely little two-bedroom flat in north London... and suddenly, I couldn't just walk down the street and buy a pint of milk.","I think more and more people these days go for the safe option in film making.","I really believe in, 'Move on, live and let live, forgive and forget.'","You have to forgive me because I have a habit of not winning things.","I feel very strongly that 'curves' are natural, womanly and real.","I am not a hypocrite.","I do like being busy. I'm not the kind of person who just sits around and goes to a spa when I'm not working.","If I'm going to change, my life and experiences should change me for the wiser and more profound.","When I was doing 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' I was asked, 'If there was one part of your life that you could erase, what would it be?' And I was so stunned by that. I thought: 'Nothing.' I would keep all the good bits and the bad bits, because those things made me who I am.","I've decided I am going to start loving my backside because I don't know anyone who does that. And for my daughter, I want to be able to say to her, 'I love this.'","I wouldn't dream of working on something that didn't make my gut rumble and my heart want to explode.","Before I was a mother, if I'd been photographed in a bikini, I'd have been mortified.","By nature, I'm a very positive person, and because I'm happy in myself, and in my life, and I've got a great husband, and beautiful children, and I have a job that I love that calls for a certain amount of emotional expression, I get to realise a lot of my dreams and aspirations.","I'd much rather be known as some curvy Kate than as some skinny stick.","You know why I fear people's judgment? Because I know they're judging. I know they are.","Experiencing those moments of being alone... is a very, very weird flooring and exposing position to be in when you're just not used to it... But I've never been lonely. And with my kids Mia and Joe that remains the case.","Before 'Titanic,' yes, I had done some things and, yes, I had been nominated for an Academy Award, but I had never been sort of world-famous. And I suppose, yes, I am really famous now. But I feel embarrassed to say that because it's just a bit daft for me.","Kitchens are so important. They're the heart of everything.","Acting, and the privilege of being able to do it for a living, is so important to me. I don't turn up and just hope for the best. I really fret about it. I do my homework; I prepare myself for the experience of playing a particular character.","I think any form of self-expression is half confidence, half sheer hard work and, maybe, a bit of talent thrown in.","Loving someone is setting them free, letting them go.","I'm not a gardener. I wish I was.","I burp, I fart. I'm a real woman.","I have always lived an ordinary life, and always will. It's who and what has to do with my job that makes it 'unordinary.' I cook, go to the supermarket, pick my children up at school.","It doesn't make any sense... that's why I trust it!","I am insecure. If you ask me, everybody is.","The experience of making a movie is far removed from watching the end result. It's exciting, but it still makes me squirm.","I love to cook. I could never give that up.","I was suddenly really famous, and I didn't know how to cope. I didn't know myself well enough as a person, number one, and as an actor, number two. I wanted to escape.","I have always wanted my children's dads to be involved in their lives. Not just the day-to-day aspect, but the emotional shifts that they go through, when little things pop up - they need to be included, absolutely, and for the children to feel that they are.","I've decided I am going to start loving my backside because I don't know anyone who does that.","I feel like I'm playing more of a role walking down the red carpet than when I'm playing an ordinary woman covered in sweat.","When you're 21, you think, 'Oh God, when I'm 36, oh God, that's nearly 40 and I'll look really old and wrinkly by then.' And actually, I quite like the way I look.","I like the idea of, not shocking people, but just throwing people off. Doing something that makes people go, 'Whoa, whoa, she did that next? Wow, didn't think she was gonna do something like that next.'","I don't read any reviews, so I'm oblivious to what they have to say. I'm completely unaware. It's fantastic.","I had a terrible bout of acne after I turned 30.","My dad was very much a struggling actor and spent more of his life as a postman, as a member of a tarmac firm, as a van driver.","I want to keep my health and my sanity and be well and feel happy. Plus, I want to have fun.","Single mums do come in for a hard time. Society is incredibly judgmental. I know this.","Lots of male friendships begin as a cheeky snog. Or a little undercurrent of flirtation.","I don't have those great, strong, glowing pregnancies.","Eli Wallach is my very own Sexiest Man Alive!","My husband is not a jealous person in any way.","There are moments to indulge and enjoy, but I always know when it's time to go home and wash my knickers.","Ah, my dad's whistle. On holidays when I was a kid, we would all be off in the rock pools along the beach. When it came time to go, we'd hear the whistle and we'd all come running. Like dogs!","I do have impossibly high standards.","To produce foie gras, ducks and geese are force-fed enormous amounts of grain and fat, which causes their livers to swell to many times the normal size.","Since I was 13 or 14 I've always felt older than I actually am.","Just because society, and government, and whatever was different 100 years ago, doesn't mean that people didn't have sex, pick their nose, or swear.","I finally moved out of my parent's house. It was only fair to let my sister have her own room.","There's more to life than cheek bones.","The whole concept of 'grounding' children is utterly stupid - they just go off and rebel and don't like you. When my kids eventually come along, I don't want them to not like me.","I'd rather do theatre and British films than move to L.A. in hopes of getting small roles in American films.","It's funny when someone says to you 'you're hot' and all that, because I don't think of it in that way.","I like exposing myself. There's not an awful lot that embarrasses me. I'm the kind of actress who absolutely believes in exposing herself.","I was a wayward child, very passionate and very determined. If I made up my mind to do something, there was no stopping me.","My skin still crawls if you call me a movie star. I get embarrassed. I think, don't be ridiculous. Maybe it's because I'm British. To me, Julia Roberts that's a movie star. But when people do call me one, that, I think, is an enormous compliment but, my God, is that a responsibility!","I hope I'm always learning something.","So I won an Oscar. It's amazing. I've got that for the rest of my life for a performance I am proud of. It nearly killed me. I am really proud of the film. That's it, moving on.","There's not an awful lot that embarrasses me. I'm the kind of actress that absolutely believes in exposing myself.","I never had a desire to be famous... I was fat. I didn't know any fat famous actresses... You know, once a fat kid, always a fat kid. Because you always think that you just look a little bit wrong or a little bit different from everyone else. And I still sort of have that.","I'm obsessed with 'Top Chef'.","I danced a lot when I was younger, and I've always had decent, shapely legs and thought it's now or never. I mean, when you're pushing 40, are you really going to wander around in a dress that's midthigh length?","I think of myself as a mum who finds the time to go to work. I have to check myself for baby sick before I walk out of the house in the morning. I am really a mum... I know I am a great mother.","Love to me, God, this is so difficult... To me, love is when you meet that person and you think, 'This is it, this is who I'm supposed to be with.'","I'm not very technically minded. I mean, I don't know how to do e-mail on computers.","I resent that there is an image of perfection that is getting thinner and thinner. I've got a lovely husband and children, and I didn't lose weight to find those things.","I've never left them to go do a film. No, we all go together. I could never leave them. My kids are my whole world.","When I think about somebody like Keira Knightley, whom I don't particularly know, I see somebody who is working hard, really trying to challenge herself and make smart choices in spite of people criticising her size and performances.","I do think it's important for young women to know that magazine covers are retouched. People don't really look like that.","In films I might look glamorous, but I've been in hair and make-up for two hours.","Oh, I had, 'No one will ever fancy me!' I had that well into my teens. Even now I do not consider myself to be some kind of great, sexy beauty. I don't mind the way I'm ageing. No reason to panic just yet. I think I look my age, and that's fine.","I think I can see more clearly now - about how the pattern of past experiences has shaped who I am and the characters I have played - and I'm grateful for that.","Playing Juliet in 'Heavenly Creatures' changed my life, and the role of Clementine in' Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' opened many new doors creatively.","Real luxury is having the time to read endless stories in bed with my children. And I get that all the time. I'm so blessed.","My job as the actress playing Hanna Schmitz, as the actress playing any part, is to understand the character, and to ultimately love the character. And I did love Hanna, absolutely, because I understood her as profoundly as I did at the end of the day.","Honestly, among my acquaintances there is no woman wearing XS.","Every woman has a mother, and every woman will have an issue with that mother and things that mother did or didn't do. It just depends on how you choose to process the lessons that you learned from your own mother.","I never had crushes on anybody when I was younger; I really didn't.","Guy Pearce played Mike in 'Neighbors'. I would fake illness to stay off school and watch the one P.M. show, and I would also watch it again when it was repeated at 5:25 P.M. Obsessed.","As a woman, especially when you have children, one gets so good at soldiering on - almost too good.","Those days of every child having a mummy and daddy who lived at home - Daddy went to work, and Mummy stayed at home and took care of everyone - those days have almost gone, and it's so much more unconventional now."],"Kate del Castillo":["First, I eat healthy; it comes from the inside out. If you eat right, your skin, hair, nails will look good. The same if you have negative thoughts - they can give you a bad look, too; we reflect what we eat and think. We also taste and smell what we eat. Being happy and doing what I love really reflects.","In terms of relationships, I've had two failures, although I don't like to call them failures; they are self learning, and I cannot say I regret any of my relationships. I've always said that I am a much loved woman.","I do not see myself, I never make plans, I never set goals, and I never do that kind of stuff; I don't like to futurize, I barely know what I will do tomorrow, and because there is a working plan here, I've never futurized because life always surprises me with things even better.","I like challenges, I like that fear you feel for something new, and with a new director, I think it's very important to always support new projects.","I'm interested in seeking projects no matter where, no matter if it is in the United States, whether in Chile, whether in Venezuela.","My job is to create myself a career that I can go to sleep satisfied with what I'm doing.","I've always wanted my own fragrance; Avon pairs with the way I think: what they do and represent, what they do for women, and the good causes such as domestic violence, and breast cancer.","When not working, I use a lot of treatments; from ancient casero - honey, avocado, stuff like that - other times, I buy ones you leave on for a few minutes. I don't blow dry my hair ever unless for work; I'd rather go for the natural look.","I like men who are intelligent and sensitive.","I started in movies in Mexico and started doing telenovelas in Mexico. 'American Family' was the first thing I did in English.","I will always be an actress. I couldn't see myself without acting. But I'd love to direct and keep writing. I don't think one has to be in place of the other.","I love drama. Drama is, like, my thing. I want a movie that will move something inside me, that's going to shift something and keep me thinking.","I am a leader in my own world. That's enough for me.","I'm always trying to push for women's rights.","Unfortunately we - and I'm speaking not for Latin America but for Mexico because that's where I come from - we still, I think, are a little bit macho. Not that we only live in a macho world, but we also think as a macho world; even the women, you know? The women in Mexico, because that's the way we were raised.","If you're black, if you're gay, if you're Latin - we're all the same. We're all the same, and we all want the same: We want to be happy.","For me, I never take a job thinking it's going to grab ratings or that it's even going to be a success. I don't. I just take the job because I love the character. Or I love the script. Maybe I love the director. But whatever I do, I never think about how it will do. That is not in my hands.","I give 110% while I am working. I know I do, because I have been doing this since I was nine. This is a way of life for me. So whether it be successful or not is not in my hands. I still do my job, the best I can.","I have been very fortunate in my life. I think I have an angel that is always with me. Good projects always come to me.","I don't care where I have to go for work. I just care that it's a good project. That's what I want."],"Katee Sackhoff":["I wear high heels and dresses. I am a total girly girl.","I think that I am lucky and blessed to have the job that I have, and I am trying to create longevity. If that means that I transition into different things at different points in my life, then that's fine. I also believe that if doors don't open, make new doors, so I've also started producing quite a bit of things.","I grew up in a small town where we played around on motorcycles and things, but it really started when I got old enough. I think I was obsessed with the culture of riding. I got sick of having to date guys who rode motorcycles for me to be on them.","It's crazy: when it's raining, it makes no sense to me that people drive 10 miles an hour faster than they normally would, but then the other thing that makes no sense is when people drive 30 miles an hour slower than normal.","Things that happen in Wyoming are things that wouldn't happen in a big city - we've got bears, we've got a lot of shotguns - in Absaroka County, everybody's got a shotgun in the back of their car!","I love Harley Quinn. I do. I just love it.","As people, right now, we're so over-stimulated in this world that I don't know what I'd do in Wyoming. I really don't know what I'd do. I would probably have a heart attack because I'd be so lonely, and I'd actually have to listen to myself think. That's a terrifying prospect for myself, and I'm sure many other people as well.","I think when you're doing good work, you don't necessarily need to be validated.","The sad thing is, I never wanted to be Princess Leia - I always wanted to be Han Solo!","I have to remind myself constantly to not be antisocial, because I stay to myself a lot. I'm a lot more introspective than my characters.","The work environment on 'Battlestar Galactica' is unbelievable, and it's something that doesn't come along very often.","People don't realize that I started in musical theater. That's where my roots are.","I love playing these characters that are crazy tough, though. Because I am not in real life. Not at all.","I think God's wrath and purgatory are the only things keeping me on the straight and narrow. I like the idea of purgatory. It's like a cosmic do-over.","People love a good story, even if it's a story that has very little truth to it.","I've got my Peabody and my Saturn awards right next to each other on my mantle, and that is about it, and that is all that matters.","I don't think I've ever been haunted by a ghost, but I always joke with my fiance about the house we're living in right now. It seems to have something in it.","'Somnia' is a story about loss and, I guess, what you're willing to do to have closure and try and feel whole again. It's a story of redemption in a sense. I don't want to give too much away, but it's a heartbreaking story that's incredibly terrifying.","There's a joke that, if you can ride through Texas with somebody, which is 700 miles of just straight, flat freeway riding, then you can be friends with them forever.","I always have said from the beginning of my career that I was going for the 'Geek Trifecta' because I'm such a total geek. I want to be in everything that has to do with the things that I enjoyed when I was a kid, which was 'Battlestar Galactica,' and being in 'Big Bang Theory,' and being in video games.","I still sleep with my baby blanket.","I get recognized so much. It happens mostly when I'm in Starbucks.","I was addicted to the original 'Star Trek' when I was growing up, because of my dad. We grew up in St. Helens, Oregon and we weren't allowed to watch a lot of TV.","You know, I like to think that I'm a really strong, tough person, but I'm not. I'm a very, very needy person. I'm very insecure. I'm very impressionable.","I grew up watching science fiction and action movies. I love it. I absolutely love it!","I'm more of a thriller-horror fan - things that could really happen. I don't like scary movies, the 'Saw' movies scare the crap out of me - I think I've seen two of them and I wanted to go crawl in a hole.","Science fiction fans are awesome - they love you so much that they'll watch anything you do, even if it's complete crap. I never dreamed that I would go to conventions and sit down and have coffee with a Klingon. It's so weird, but it's my life.","I grew up in Oregon so I grew up around reservations, so I've always kind of had this knowledge. Not a tremendous amount of knowledge, but an outsider's knowledge of what reservation life was like.","My dad always said that hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard enough.","I am tired of women playing action heroes like men, because they are not men. But sometimes they are written like men.","Some of the craziest people I've met, in my life, are some of the most brilliant people I've met.","I think every character I play has a physicality to them, so I have to stay in some sort of shape. I'll never be a size two. And I don't want to be a size two.","It's interesting, the things you learn when you're 21. I learned never to get tattoos in the middle of shooting a movie. Because if you're not Angelina Jolie or Megan Fox, they will fire you.","My mom always said, 'Marry someone smarter than yourself, Katee, because No. 1, you're not that smart. And No. 2, then you'll have smart babies.'","I famously had a huge television producer say to me one time, 'Can you please stop doing that to your face? It's very distracting and unattractive.' And I was like, 'You mean move it? Okay, sorry, I guess we're not going to work together.'","I'm a bit insane when it comes to doing my own stunts and getting down and dirty. It's fun, you know? It's things I wouldn't normally do in my real life, so when I go to work and get to beat people up and shoot guns and get waterboarded, those are things I find completely interesting.","I'd never put all my chips anywhere, because I don't want to close any doors, but I was raised in a very blue-collar family. I was raised by parents who said, 'If you don't go to work every day, you're not contributing', so that's my mentality. I have to work every day; I have to bring home a paycheck.","I hate horror movies, with a passion.","No one has approached me about Captain Marvel. But I don't know if I'd even want to play Captain Marvel. I would much rather play a villain and be nasty. It's more fun.","I love playing characters who are multilayered and multidimensional and have a darkness to them, which makes them more realistic and more fun to play.","I'd love to play Wonder Woman.","I remember auditioning for the Wonder Woman television show and being told that I wasn't the Wonder Woman type, but if I wanted to play the best friend, I could audition for that.","I absolutely have not spoken to Marvel. It doesn't mean that my team hasn't spoken to Marvel.","I personally have not spoken to Marvel and have no plans to do a movie in the immediate future because, number one, I'm tied up with 'Somnia,' which is a fantastic place to be. It's exactly where I wanted to be.","I would hate for my father to regret all his support that he's given me over the years and be embarrassed by anything I chose to do.","I have never looked at a child and been so angry that I flipped out.","Everyone freaks out because my character is the only one who has shorts on the Galactica. Well, that is because I went and grabbed a pair of pants and scissors and cut them off and gave her shorts.","Michael Hogan is an absolutely brilliant actor, so anytime I get to work with someone of that caliber, I get excited.","'Star Wars' meant everything to me growing up.","'Star Wars' was, I mean, it was the first time I remember seeing three movies that all kind of went together. It was just an amazing final understanding of what a trilogy was.","Playing somebody who's still alive is very interesting.","You can't win some people over.","My goal is to make people feel passionately, if it's negative or positive, I did my job.","As an actor, you put yourself out there. You put yourself in the arena as an easy target.","I'm not very good in crowds, so I usually try to become as small as possible.","I'm always awkward when someone recognizes me.","I don't watch a lot of TV.","The Olympics was a goal, and definitely, swimming in college was a goal.","I was planning that whole athletic slide into Stanford rather than actually getting a 1450 on my SATs.","I looked at my parents when I was 17, and I said, 'I'm moving to L.A.'","It's things I wouldn't normally do in my real life, so when I go to work and get to beat people up and shoot guns and get waterboarded, those are things I find completely interesting.","Basically, as soon as I saw that there was a role available on '24,' I jumped at it, and then when I sat down and talked to them, it seemed to get more interesting and more fun.","If a character is supposed to be hated, my goal is to make her the most hated person on the show.","I read the script for 'Somnia' when I was filming 'Oculus,' and I remember calling my manager going, 'I really need to do this movie,' and he's like, 'How about you finish this one first and then you see it?' I was like, 'I don't need to. I don't need to. You need to read this. I need to do this movie. The script is very good.'","Seth Green, he and I are trying to figure out how this all came about. Because we don't remember what came first, the chicken or the egg, no pun intended. But I don't remember what came first, 'Robot Chicken' or our friendship, because we've known each other for so long.","I've seen 'Absentia,' which was amazing. I loved 'Absentia.' I loved that for no money, he was able to make a movie about something that you never saw. You never saw the bad guys. That was amazing to me. You never saw what you were supposed to be afraid of; you just knew you were supposed to be afraid of it. It was a phenomenal movie.","'Longmire' is an incredibly hard shooting schedule because the locations are usually an hour away every morning, and I come home every weekend. I fly back to L.A. for about 26 hours a weekend, just to touch base back at home. It's a lot of work. It's four really intense months.","I love to run, and I actually run quite a bit.","I'll work out with my trainer twice a week, and I'll do some Power Pilates and might throw in some yoga. I love to row also. The main thing for me is just to move every single day for 30 minutes to an hour.","I think, as a woman in action in the business, you would be stupid not to express interest. Any female action role that presents itself as an opportunity I would throw myself at!","I grew up as a fan of comic books, and I've been reading them for so long that I've never felt an affinity toward just one.","I'm a huge fan of Kate Beckinsale. Sigourney Weaver gets me excited. Angelina Jolie... There's just so many women that do 'tough' really well.","I think that what made people accept Starbuck as a woman was that she was just such an interesting character. I think that once people put their guard down and their preconceived notions of what the show is supposed to be and just allowed it to really be good science fiction.","I think that probably the time that people stopped thinking of Starbuck as 'a woman' was when they stopped thinking of the old show.","As far as I'm concerned... there's a side to an actor that wants to go on and play a thousand different roles.","I loved the challenge of being able to take a character who could be thrown away as 'crazy' and making her identifiable to the audience - also, to give her a vulnerability that people would cheer for.","It's interesting: I've been doing this since I was 17, and it's kind of weird to see yourself grow up on television.","Sarah Corvus in 'Bionic Woman' was one of my favorite characters I've ever played, ever, for reasons that are very similar to Nikki in 'Sexy Evil Genius.' I felt that that show was taken away from me too soon, and I really wanted to dive back into that mind frame again.","I love playing women, and I think that this is a throughline to a lot of the characters I've played - they all have this aspect of being wronged. And I think, a lot of the time, the characters are actually wronged by themselves, and they find someone else to blame it on.","I'm a lot girlier than the roles that I play. I joke with Tricia Helfer all the time that she's my muscle.","There's a darkness to Riddick that I think allows people to want him to do bad things because you know Riddick is going to do bad things: that's just the way it is. But I think that at his core, who he is and what he's fighting for is something that everybody can identify with.","It's a very, very rare moment when another actor hurts you. That's not normal. If anything, it's the actor accidentally punching the stunt double, which happens quite a bit.","I don't subscribe to the thinking that being typecast is a bad thing.","As long as people want to see me do this action and sci-fi stuff, it would be wrong of me to deny the fans what they want to see.","I'm not a big person, so every time they were adding these big guys to the cast, I said to my trainer, 'We're screwed, dude.' I'm only five foot five, and I'm going to look so little.","What can you do? You're never going to be - I'm sure there are people out there who think Cindy Crawford isn't pretty.","It's weird to me to see how different everyone's opinion of beauty is.","We're not curing cancer, people. I wish we were, but we're not. It's entertainment.","There's always going to be someone somewhere who doesn't agree with my parents' opinion of me. It can't bother you.","I think what we've been able to do with 'Longmire' is balance this procedural with a bit of a soap opera, and it's a character study of this character, Walt Longmire, and the people around him.","It's kind of nice to play somebody that isn't psychotic or half-machine or dead or dying or on a spaceship somewhere.","We all wake up, and I'm sure at some point during the day we all have very similar thoughts regardless of our circumstances and where we are in the world.","Of course I love the action. I absolutely love doing action movies; it's what makes me tick, but I think my dream role is a movie that Will Smith's company has called 'Paper Wings.'","As far as acting goes, you get to a certain point where, I think, everyone can do the job, and it comes down to a level of commitment. I think sometimes all you have to do is show up.","The fight scenes are pretty easy and come pretty naturally for me, to be honest.","I know that you can only keep a secret a secret for so long.","There's a side to you as an actor, a selfish side, that wants to go on and play different roles.","Somebody can't complain when they enjoy going to work and enjoy the people they work with.","With a first season, you never really know how viewers or the network are going to react to a show.","I knew from the first episode that 'Longmire' was something special - I met the writers/exec producers, read the script, and knew it was special, so to have the network and the studio and the fans get behind it in the way that they have has been really amazing.","'Battlestar' was 22 episodes - 9 to 10 months a year - and we were exhausted. You finish shooting, and the last thing you want to do is go back to work. You want those 3 months off because you're tired - it's a grueling shooting schedule.","I've always said that I'll know when I've gone too far because I won't be able to sit down and watch it with my father.","I am a daddy's girl at heart, even though I'm in my 30s.","A lot of shows fly under the radar for the first couple seasons and then become successful. It doesn't necessarily have any bearing on the success of the show or how much the network is behind it.","I love that when you take that PG-13 off the table and say, 'This is what we're going to do,' everything becomes fair game, and you really go for it.","In some weird, warped way, I'm actually convinced that if I got mugged, I could probably take out the guy.","I had a stalker break into my house a couple times. They didn't leave any fingerprints or take anything - I was being followed.","People associate girls with long blonde hair with the girls in 'Clueless' or 'Legally Blonde.' You can't be smart and educated and have an opinion because you are supposed to be stupid.","I fought for a long time on 'Battlestar' to let my hair grow out. It was very frustrating because every single person on the show was changing their hair. It was not fair.","My manager has been my manager since I was 17, and he says that he's supposed to be smart for me when I can't do it for myself.","Something about 'Battlestar' that I didn't realize when I took the job was this whole bubble aspect of closing people in and seeing what they do.","We leave TVs on in our house. I listen to my record player constantly to just hear music. I'm really intrigued by this idea of solitude.","When I was younger, it was like, 'Yay, lesbians love me!' I didn't know there was a responsibility that came with it.","Playing tough characters just comes easy for me. It's not who I am in real life, so I love going to work and pretending to be something I'm not. I love all the action and confidence. But when I finally go do a rom-com, I hope my fans will support me.","I read YA novels constantly, so I really want to be in a young adult rom-com, but I worry that I'm aging into the parent role, which is a little scary.","I'm kind of used to being around guys on set, and I grew up with a brother who treated me like I was a boy.","I've never really had the opportunity to play something that's a complete departure from me yet.","The first movie my dad ever showed me was 'Predator' - I was five. And I think the second one was 'Jaws.'"],"Katey Sagal":["There isn't a lot written about the motorcycle culture.","I've certainly experienced physical pain in my life.","I had to accept the fact that sometimes things happen that are out of our hands.","I do a lot of writing about my family.","I would literally have to go meet people so they could see I didn't have big red hair and wear high heels constantly. It was just really ingrained in people.","I grew up listening to a lot of soul music, and a lot of folk music.","You know, we travelled a lot when I was a kid because my father was wherever the work was.","When you grow up around it, I just watched my father work really hard. He wasn't around as much as I would have liked. And when I grew up, I understood why.","Um, I have an enormous faith in God. I have an enormous support system that also has that same belief.","To be shapely when you're in the seventh grade is not exactly what everyone's looking for, or they weren't then, as someone was telling me the other day. now, that's like a really great thing to do, to be, but then it wasn't.","So you know, my plan was that I was going to make records, and be a rock star. And that's really what I wanted to do. And I sang from the time I was very young.","So they've actually - it's not that her character is a singer, but she had ambition to do that at an earlier time in her life. So I've actually sung two or three times now on the show.","Music is extremely intuitive, which acting too in a different way.","It was really fun. It was fun for a lot of reasons. It was fun because nobody thought that we would be successful. It was on a network that wasn't even there at the time.","I'm very comfortable as a singer. In fact, I think it's more - I identified my self-esteem, my self more in those ways when I was growing up. I really - it was kind of my calling card as a kid.","I'm a pretty emotional person.","I think we respond well when we do something well.","I think I'm a soulful singer.","I loved Peg Bundy. I am so happy that I got to do that. It was really fun.","I love to perform live.","I don't know, Y'know, I always wanted to be one of those cheerleader girls and I never was that, and I was never sort of cute and perky, and I always thought it was fun to be cute and perky, and those, I don't know what those girls are doing now.","I didn't actually begin professionally acting until I was 30.","For me it's also - the music is equally as important. I mean I think as somebody who writes music, there just has to sort of be the marriage between both.","Each time I seem to go through one of life's huge things, I want to play music.","But I started it when I was going through a transitional time in my life. At the end of it, it really sort of symbolized it. I had made room to change, and room to grow. I recorded it in a little room.","And this one I wanted to do some covers. So I just really sang some of my favorite songs.","And then I think now we are - you know his - like I've always said. His spirit is so large that we feel his presence around the show, and we always will. He will always have a voice.","And I think that's why I was going to be a musician. I was very rebellious. And I didn't want to be an actor. My father used to say to me you should be an actor if you want to be in the arts.","And I like to interpret music. So I think it's all interpretive.","I was kind of lost for several years.","You know, it's hard sometimes to just detach yourself from what you're doing.","I'm not a Facebook/Twitter gal, but my husband is.","I don't take story input from fans.","I have a little kitchen office at home, where I do all my kids' stuff.","It's so weird that I play this woman who pretty much deals with violence on a daily basis, and I'm such a wimp in who I am.","I don't like violence.","Being a mother has been my greatest teacher and also the most self-sacrificing thing I've ever done.","I've never loved anybody the way I love my children.","I wanted to be a rock star when I grew up, or at least a singer/songwriter.","I'm a better mother if I'm also doing my work. Some women find a lot more satisfaction from doing the hardest job, which is being a mom. But I like my day job, so I juggle a lot.","I love TV.","I'm a big 'American Idol' watcher, and sometimes I like to watch 'America's Got Talent.' Those are big, corny admissions, but sometimes it's so fun to see those kids really sing their hearts out.","Generally, I find a lot to be grateful for.","I like when everything's naturally moving along - I find that pretty exciting.","I made a living being a background singer for years.","I've never played a character that would sing.","It's great to be mean, it is, it's fun.","I've done comedy most of my career, which I love, but I wanted to expand.","I've never worked on a lawyer show for a long time, but I imagine the actors all start acting like lawyers.","When you tour with a band, you're just out there, and it's just you guys. That's your little universe. If you do a play, it's the same deal. That becomes your world, for the cast and crew.","It's sort of the mixed blessing of being on television for so long in one thing; sometimes that backfires, in that you're not able to continue on.","I think the biggest change has been realizing I now have three children.","My thing about having another child was, time's-a-wasting!","I do tend to play characters that have a lot of costume and hair change. I sort of like the change of physicality thing.","I love interpreting other people's music.","There's so many great songs already written, it's kind of really wonderful you don't have to write your own.","I love to play gigs.","I have teenagers, so I listen to a lot of music. They turn me on to great music.","You realize mortality is everywhere.","We all have that desire to be kind of wild and bad.","I have this whole new audience now.","I work with all these amazing voice actors that do a kajillion voices.","I always had a struggle, which I still do, when you're playing a character and it's not necessarily your morals or your values. You're playing a character, but the way the media will sometimes ask you if these are your opinions, you know - they make you responsible for that, and I take issue with it because I don't believe in censorship.","'Married with Children' was racy. It was sexist. It was a lot of things, but mostly it was funny.","You know, episodic TV directing is a very long and arduous job. You have very short schedules, short short shooting days, and you have to get lot of pages done.","My parents were very artistic, but busy.","I really like sort of disappearing.","I was very rebellious."],"Katha Pollitt":["Abortion is part of being a mother and of caring for children, because part of caring for children is knowing when it's not a good idea to bring them into the world.","In the end, abortion is an issue of fundamental human rights. To force women to undergo pregnancy and childbirth against their will is to deprive them of the right to make basic decisions about their lives and well-being, and to give that power to the state.","Abortion opponents say women seek abortions in haste and confusion. Pro-choicers reply: Abortion is the most difficult, agonizing decision a woman ever makes.","Ariel may look a lot like Barbie, and her adventure may be limited to romance and over with the wedding bells, but unlike, say, Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty, she's active, brave and determined, the heroine of her own life. She even rescues the prince. And that makes her a rare fish, indeed, in the world of preschool culture.","If you have been vaccinated for polio, mumps, measles, chicken pox, hepatitis, or rabies, it may be too late for you to stand your ethical ground: You have already benefited from fetal-tissue research. This is, after all, a practice that's been legal since the 1930s.","I think the meaning of abortion is what the woman says it is: For a woman who wants a child but can't have this one, it can be sad; for a woman who doesn't want a baby, it can feel like a huge relief, like having your whole life given back to you.","Planned Parenthood is a pretty popular organization. Way more popular than Congress! It claims that one in five women have received care from one of its clinics. And this care, despite what abortion opponents say, is excellent and not easily replaceable by 'community health centers.' Texas tried it, and thousands of women went without care.","We do not have the idea that all children are valuable parts of society. We only have the idea that our own children are.","Women who give up their children for adoption are years and years later talking about how painful it was, much more than women who have abortions.","Most Americans probably have no idea how hostile anti-abortion sidewalk counseling outside clinics can be. There's a reason pro-choicers volunteer to escort patients as they make their way past angry crowds to the clinic door.","I think women have the right to consult their own wishes, needs, and capacities and produce only loved, wanted children they can care for - or even no children at all. I think we would all be better off as a society if we respected women's ability to make these decisions for themselves and concentrated on caring well for the born.","My mother had an illegal abortion in 1960, which was the year the birth control pill came out, but I guess a little late for her, but - and I never knew. I found out when my father, after her death, got her FBI file.","We want to make sure that women have a way to use all their gifts in society, to get educated, to be all they can be in the workforce, to really develop as people in all the ways that they can. We want this for men too! And we want this for children. Well this can't happen if this can be sandbagged by an ill-timed and unwanted pregnancy.","Abortion opponents know full well that the public would not abide putting women in prison en masse. Politically, it's more palatable to portray them as irrational, ignorant, and childlike, perhaps even temporarily insane.","We need to say that women have sex, have abortions, are at peace with the decision, and move on with their lives. We need to say that is their right, and, moreover, it's good for everyone that they have this right: The whole society benefits when motherhood is voluntary.","Here is the dirty little secret about anti-abortion violence: It works.","A potential person is not a person, any more than an acorn is an oak tree. I don't think women should have to give birth just because a sperm met an egg.","In our culture, the shame about accidental pregnancy is inextricable from the shame about having had sex. That disapproval of sex is one reason our record with contraception is so poor. If you're not supposed to be sexual, you don't plan for sex. You cross your fingers and hope for the best.","Sure, men like a challenge - but so do women. And nobody likes to be challenged all the time. I know plenty of long-standing happy couples who slept together right away, spent hours yakking on the phone, split checks down the middle, and lived together for years before the wedding.","The notion that female initiative is useless because men know what they want is particularly odd - most people don't even know what they want for dinner.","Opposition to abortion was one of the ways the Christian right was brought into the Republican Party by conservatives hoping to move the party further right. Now, of course, the tail is wagging the dog.","Everyone will be happier if fewer women are tied to abusive men, drop out of school, and live impoverished lives because of a random pregnancy.","There is a huge reservoir of support for abortion rights from ordinary women. I hear all the time from women who had abortions and say it made possible the good life they went on to have. Social shaming silences too many.","I think there are a very few pro-lifers who would say that a zygote in a petri dish is the equivalent of you or me; it's just younger. If you can say that without laughing, maybe you are a true pro-lifer. But I think most people are able or willing to make distinctions that show they maybe don't quite believe that.","We have an idea that the man should help pay for the child. But we don't have a law that says a man has to support any woman he gets pregnant. Why is that? Because she doesn't have the baby yet. But if we're going to say it's a human being, then he should be supporting her during pregnancy.","It's a rare pro-lifer who is against the death penalty, who's against all war, who favors, you know, all the things people need to flourish and stay healthy in life. They've tied themselves to the Republican Party, which doesn't support any of that.","Women have to control their fertility for 30 years. Thirty years is a long time not to make mistakes.","Women who have abortions are people you know. Because that is the truth! One in three American women will have an abortion by menopause.","Do men drop out of college because they get someone pregnant? Do they quit their job if they get someone pregnant? No. And we do not require men to support women they have made pregnant. Once the baby is born, there can be child support. Before that, though, no.","I put out a call on Twitter and Facebook and email for women to tell me their stories about their abortions. And many women said, 'I told my boyfriend I was pregnant, and that was the last I ever heard of them.'","Since 'Pro: Reclaiming Abortion Rights' came out, I've done a fair amount of public speaking, and the two statistics that always make the audience sit up are that nearly one in three women will have had at least one abortion by menopause and 61 percent of women who have abortions are already mothers.","Coming out was crucial to changing attitudes about gays and lesbians: will people feel differently about abortion if they know their mother, their aunt, or their friend had one?"],"Katharine Anthony":["People seem to think that life began with the achievement of personal independence.","Persons who are born too soon or born too late seldom achieve the eminence of those who are born at the right time.","Principles are a dangerous form of social dynamite.","The lovers of romance can go elsewhere for satisfaction but where can the lovers of truth turn if not to history?","To the biographer all lives bar none are dramatic constructions.","For mothers who must earn, there is indeed no leisure time problem. The long hours of earning are increased by the hours of domestic labor, until no slightest margin for relaxation or change of thought remains."],"Katharine Butler Hathaway":["There is nothing better than the encouragement of a good friend.","A person needs at intervals to separate himself from family and companions and go to new places. He must go without his familiars in order to be open to influences, to change.","If you let your fear of consequence prevent you from following your deepest instinct, your life will be safe, expedient and thin.","If you realize too acutely how valuable time is, you are too paralyzed to do anything.","I would sort out all the arguments and see which belonged to fear and which to creativeness. Other things being equal, I would make the decision which had the larger number of creative reasons on its side."],"Katharine Cornell":["I drifted into acting. My grandfather had a house in Buffalo in which there was a stage, and his friends met every two weeks or so to put on plays. So it was natural for me to put on plays, too, when I went to boarding school. I put on everything in the drama - I was indiscriminate. I put on Yeats and Shaw and Lady Gregory.","The audience may not have felt it was right, and the author may have felt a little upset, but every part I've played I've twisted around in my mind until I've made it into something of my own. Looking back over it, I didn't deliberately sit down and plan like that, but it does read like it.","I was nervous from the very beginning, and it got worse as the years went on. I was conscientious and wanted to do more, always, than I was able. I don't think, when I was playing, that I was ever happy - beginning at 4 o'clock any afternoon.","When an actress is younger, she likes to lower her age, but when she is older, she likes to add to her years.","I was with the Jessie Bonstelle Stock Company in Detroit and Buffalo for three seasons - 10 performances and a new play every week. She was an amazing woman who did a great deal for me."],"Katharine Elizabeth Fullerton Gerould":["The real drawback to the simple life is that it is not simple. If you are living it, you positively can do nothing else. There is not time.","No fashion has ever been created expressly for the lean purse or for the fat woman: the dressmaker's ideal is the thin millionaires.","It is a poor cause which has to be lied for regularly.","The insidiousness of science lies in its claim to be not a subject, but a method.","Most men have always wanted as much as they could get; and possession has always blunted the fine edge of their altruism.","There is no morality by instinct. There is no social salvation in the end without taking thought; without mastery of logic and application of logic to human experience.","Simplicity is an acquired taste. Mankind, left free, instinctively complicates life.","Conventional manners are a kind of literacy test for the alien who comes among us.","Originality usually amounts only to plagiarizing something unfamiliar.","All violations of essential privacy are brutalizing.","One of the reasons, surely, why women have been credited with less perfect veracity than men is that the burden of conventional falsehood falls chiefly on them.","Civilization is merely an advance in taste: accepting, all the time, nicer things, and rejecting nasty ones.","Ignorance of what real learning is, and a consequent suspicion of it; materialism, and a consequent intellectual laxity, both of these have done destructive work in the colleges.","Social distinctions concern themselves ultimately with whom you may and may not marry.","Educational legislation nowadays is largely in the hands of illiterate people, and the illiterate will take good care that their illiteracy is not made a reproach on them."],"Katharine Graham":["To love what you do and feel that it matters how could anything be more fun?","A mistake is simply another way of doing things.","If we had failed to pursue the facts as far as they led, we would have denied the public any knowledge of an unprecedented scheme of political surveillance and sabotage.","The thing women must do to rise to power is to redefine their femininity. Once, power was considered a masculine attribute. In fact, power has no sex.","Once, power was considered a masculine attribute. In fact, power has no sex.","No one can avoid aging, but aging productively is something else.","It took me a while to learn that certain people may have important skills that are not always blazingly apparent. Gradually I came to realize - slow as I may have been - that what mattered was performance, that sometimes people might have to be helped to develop, and that it takes all kinds to make an organization run properly.","Being a woman in control of a company - even a small private company, as ours was then - was so singular and surprising in those days that I necessarily stood out. In 1963, and for the first several years of my working life, my situation was certainly unique.","Mother set impossibly high standards for us, creating tremendous pressures and undermining our ability to accomplish whatever modest aims we may have set for ourselves.","I believed - and believe - that capitalism works best for a freedom-loving society, that it brings more prosperity to more people than any other social-economic system, but that somehow we have to take care of people.","To me, involvement with news is absolutely inebriating. It's what makes my life exciting.","Family ownership provides the independence that is sometimes required to withstand governmental pressure and preserve freedom of the press.","There are some things the general public does not need to know and shouldn't. I believe democracy flourishes when the government can take legitimate steps to keep its secrets, and when the press can decide whether to print what it knows.","Although at the time I didn't realize what was happening, I was unable to make a decision that might displease those around me. For years, whatever directive I may have issued ended with the phrase, 'If it's all right with you.' If I thought I'd done anything to make someone unhappy, I'd agonize.","If one is rich and one's a woman, one can be quite misunderstood.","I adopted the assumption of many of my generation that women were intellectually inferior to men, that we were not capable of governing, leading, managing anything but our homes and our children.","The image of me as someone who likes or can deal with a fight is wrong. Some people enjoy competition and dustups, and I wish I did, but I don't. But once you have started down a path, then I think you have to move forward. You can't give up.","So few grown women like their lives.","The press these days should be rather careful about its role. We may have acquired some tendencies about over-involvement that we had better overcome.","In large families, it seems it is hardest to be either the first or the last child. That was certainly true in ours.","My position in the family turned out to be a lucky one; I bore neither the brunt of my mother's newness to parenthood nor the force of her middle-aged traumas, as my younger sister, Ruth, did.","One of my principal childhood memories is hearing one of the Liszt Hungarian Rhapsodies waft throughout the house.","Mountain climbing was one of Mother's favorite occupations, but she never succeeded in inculcating this passion in any of us.","Potomac School proved to be my first big adjustment - one that helped me with a basic lesson of growing up: learning to get along in whatever world one is deposited.","There have been two periods in my lifetime when the excitement of government and of public issues drew to Washington many of the bright young people graduating from colleges and law schools. These were essentially the Roosevelt and the Kennedy years.","In my first year or so at the 'Post,' I began to write with some frequency on the least important issues - so-called light editorials. The titles themselves are revealing of just how light: 'On Being a Horse,' 'Brains and Beauty,' 'Mixed Drinks,' 'Lou Gehrig,' and 'Spotted Fever.'","Those first few years of marriage, before the war interrupted all our lives, Phil and I had a very happy time. I grew up considerably, mostly thanks to him.","I didn't really want deadlines and editorial work. I wanted something mechanical and eight hours a day. So I went to work, thinking it was easy - ha, ha - on the complaint desk at the circulation department.","For more than eight decades, Washington has been my hometown. My whole orientation is toward this place.","I love Martha's Vineyard, where I have had a house for thirty years. I have loved visiting countries around the world. But I always come home to Washington.","There seems to me nothing very bad about a nation's capital having good intentions - and when the intentions are magnificent, so much the better.","When it comes to Washington, most people tend to think first of politics. But Washington is also a geographic and physical place. It is, for instance, one of the few cities of the world where you can talk endlessly about trees.","One doesn't soon forget the natural beauty of Washington, although those of us who live here do sometimes take it for granted.","Dean Acheson was one of the very best and brightest of the men who ever came to Washington.","I always liked Barbara Howar and admired her spunk. I know that she considered me - and Alice Roosevelt Longworth - an exception to her negative feelings about Washington widows and single women, whom she basically found dispensable.","Alice Roosevelt Longworth was only a few years older than my mother but outlived her by a decade, dying in 1980. From the time they met, in 1917, they were lifelong friends of sorts, though each was a bit wary of the other.","I remember the Washington in which I grew up as a genuine small town. Maybe this is true for everyone, that we all feel that the times in which we grew up were simpler, less complex.","When in 1969 I became publisher of the 'Washington Post' as well as president of the company, my plate was fuller than ever. I had partly worked myself into the job but not, except for rare occasions, taken hold. I had acquired some sense of business but still relied on others more than most company presidents did.","The organization that I joined when I went to work, the trade association called the Bureau of Advertising, became the first of many over the years in which I was the only woman.","At least through most of the 1960s, I basically lived in a man's world, hardly speaking to a woman all day except to the secretaries. But I was almost totally unaware of myself as an oddity and had no comprehension of the difficulties faced by working women in our organization and elsewhere.","My mother seemed to undermine so much of what I did, subtly belittling my choices and my activities in light of her greater, more important ones.","I truly believed that other people in my position didn't make mistakes; I couldn't see that everybody makes them, even people with great experience."],"Katharine Hepburn":["Life is hard. After all, it kills you.","If you obey all the rules you miss all the fun.","We are taught you must blame your father, your sisters, your brothers, the school, the teachers - but never blame yourself. It's never your fault. But it's always your fault, because if you wanted to change you're the one who has got to change.","If you want to sacrifice the admiration of many men for the criticism of one, go ahead, get married.","Plain women know more about men than beautiful women do.","I think most of the people involved in any art always secretly wonder whether they are really there because they're good or there because they're lucky.","Sometimes I wonder if men and women really suit each other. Perhaps they should live next door and just visit now and then.","I have many regrets, and I'm sure everyone does. The stupid things you do, you regret... if you have any sense, and if you don't regret them, maybe you're stupid.","Being a housewife and a mother is the biggest job in the world, but if it doesn't interest you, don't do it - I would have made a terrible mother.","As for me, prizes are nothing. My prize is my work.","Without discipline, there's no life at all.","Dressing up is a bore. At a certain age, you decorate yourself to attract the opposite sex, and at a certain age, I did that. But I'm past that age.","My greatest strength is common sense. I'm really a standard brand - like Campbell's tomato soup or Baker's chocolate.","Enemies are so stimulating.","Love has nothing to do with what you are expecting to get - only with what you are expecting to give - which is everything.","If you always do what interests you, at least one person is pleased.","It's a rather rude gesture, but at least it's clear what you mean.","Acting is a nice childish profession - pretending you're someone else and, at the same time, selling yourself.","Life is to be lived. If you have to support yourself, you had bloody well better find some way that is going to be interesting. And you don't do that by sitting around.","I never lose sight of the fact that just being is fun.","Never complain. Never explain.","I never realized until lately that women were supposed to be the inferior sex.","Why slap them on the wrist with feather when you can belt them over the head with a sledgehammer.","It would be a terrific innovation if you could get your mind to stretch a little further than the next wisecrack.","Only the really plain people know about love - the very fascinating ones try so hard to create an impression that they soon exhaust their talents.","Death will be a great relief. No more interviews.","When I started out, I didn't have any desire to be an actress or to learn how to act. I just wanted to be famous.","Acting is the perfect idiot's profession.","To be loved is very demoralizing.","The average Hollywood film star's ambition is to be admired by an American, courted by an Italian, married to an Englishman and have a French boyfriend.","It's life isn't it? You plow ahead and make a hit. And you plow on and someone passes you. Then someone passes them. Time levels.","If you want to give up the admiration of thousands of men for the distain of one, go ahead, get married.","Acting is the most minor of gifts. After all, Shirley Temple could do it when she was four.","Marriage is a series of desperate arguments people feel passionately about.","It's a business you go into because you're an egocentric. It's a very embarrassing profession.","To keep your character intact you cannot stoop to filthy acts. It makes it easier to stoop the next time.","Trying to be fascinating is an asinine position to be in."],"Katharine Isabelle":["Going through puberty as a young girl is so confusing. This monster invades your body, changes things and makes things grow, and no one tells you what's going on.","My favourite actors are all dead or dying. I just love Jimmy Stewart, Bette Davis, Katharine Hepburn - I was named after her - and Cary Grant. I just love old black and white movies and the stars in them. It must have been a great time to be in Hollywood.","Horror movies scare me. I don't really watch them. I'm not a big horror genre fan. I like certain classic horror - like 'Alien', 'Jaws', 'The Exorcist', stuff like that.","I understand, as the young, attractive woman in film, that there's always going to be people seeking out extra salacious things for you to do.","I'm a working actor, so I do pretty much whatever comes along because it's my job.","I think you have to have a sense of humor about every movie that you're doing. Your character needs to be relatable in a way that, even when you're doing the most bizarre things, sometimes a bit of tongue in cheek is necessary to keep up the believability of it.","I'm a bit of a chicken when it comes to seeing potentially horrifying things on the Internet.","My roots are Scottish. My dad's parents are from Scotland, and my mum's dad is Scots.","I grew up on my dad's sets, but I was never star-struck or desperate to be famous. I grew up being a worker. It took me a long time to realise that my work ended up being seen by people. As far as I was concerned, I was just in the family business.","I don't have any friends from my childhood because I didn't stay at one school for very long.","I have a few girlfriends, but nearly all my friends are guys. I don't think I ever wore girl clothes. I wore baggy jeans, baggy T-shirts, sweaters, just to avoid the looks that everyone gives you when you're a young female in the world."],"Katharine Kerr":["Over the years, a number of people have asked me why I tend to write at this great length. I've put some thought into the answer, and it can be boiled down one word: consequences. Well, maybe two words: consequences and characters. Or perhaps, consequences, characters, and the subconscious mind - above all the subconscious mind.","Not all series books are sagas. Some are shaped more like beads on a string, separate episodes held together by a set of characters, who may or may not grow and change as the series continues.","An actual saga demands change, both in its characters and its world.","I personally am a 'discovery writer,' as we're termed, someone who plans the book by writing it and then revising the entire thing. When it comes to saga, this means writing large chunks of prose before any of it coalesces into a book."],"Katharine Lee Bates":["Love planted a rose, and the world turned sweet.","It is the hour to rend thy chains, the blossom time of souls.","Surely martyrs, irrespective of the special phase of the divine idea for which they gladly give up their bodies to torture and to death, are the truest heroes of history.","Warwick Castle, built of the very centuries, cannot be expected to alter with time's 'brief hours and weeks' - at least, with so few of them as fall to one poor mortal's lot. From visit to visit, I find it as unchanged as the multiplication table.","Spanish children are too often ill-cared for, but despite the abuses of ignorant motherhood and fatherhood, such vivid, vivacious, bewitching little people as they are!","A taste for the best reading is not cultivated in Spanish girls, even where the treasures of that great Castilian literature are accessible to them.","The life of Liverpool is commerce; it is a city of warehouses and shops.","The habit of begging, that plague of tourist resorts, is an incessant nuisance on the Alhambra hill.","Shakespeare's frequent horseback journeys from London to Stratford, and from Stratford to London, must have made him familiar with the county of Oxfordshire."],"Katharine McPhee":["It feels good to be strong.","Everyone has that inner voice, the one that's a Negative Nancy. I'd say to ignore that voice and to be confident and follow your heart.","To be honest, I'm really more of a jeans and T-shirt kind of a girl.","I wish I could wear clothes straight off the runway.","If you deprive yourself of something, you're going to want it more.","Your traditions change from when you are child to when you become an adult.","I am just the person who didn't want to settle for not having everything I dreamed of.","America is a country with so much opportunity. I'm living the blessings of what this country offers.","I have always loved the Summer Olympics.","I was a competitive swimmer in middle school and high school.","Even if I weren't in Hollywood, I would feel pressure to look a certain way.","I don't have to be a 'gazillionaire;' what's important to me is to just being able to work.","I'm not a perfect human being.","I grew up in dance class, so I was looking in mirrors all day.","The thing is, work is the thing I love the most.","I have an amazing relationship with food.","I love my body when I'm in the best shape I can be in.","I can understand why guys wouldn't be into 'Glee.' You know, that's a pretty heavy musical show. That show does, like, six songs in an episode.","No, I'm not a scientologist.","I'm a horrible drawer. I have no artistic ability in my hands.","I still have to count on my hands! I'll be in a restaurant doing a tip and I'll be like, 'What's 20% of this?'","I'm so unprofessional on set it's not even funny.","I enjoy going to church.","I love entertaining.","The reason I haven't had kids yet is because I was so focused on my acting career, hoping I could get something to break.","My fondest memories are generally the day after Thanksgiving. I get the total decorating Christmas itch.","Christmas is a time of year that's so romantic.","One thing I learned about people is that they love to give their opinions about things.","I'm a spiritual person.","I truly believe that God provides.","I think we all depend on a significant other, and we think if they leave me, I'll die. But that's not true. We're all much stronger than we think we are.","Marriage gives you a new respect for a person.","I don't really dress up for Halloween.","I love the spirit of Halloween and the energy that comes with it.","I get the celebrity game now - you can go from being hot to fighting to be seen.","Broadway is a definite symbol of New York. It's classic New York.","I've long wanted to find a charitable cause to really get involved with and be passionate about. I get invited to a lot of charity events to sing, and I am happy to help and bring a source of entertainment, but I'm sort of disconnected from them.","I have family members who live in Africa. Because of the family that lives there, I know what is happening in these countries, and it seems so silly to me that diseases like malaria are so prevalent when they are entirely preventable. Yet children are still dying every 35 seconds.","I have intentionally not pursued musical theater.","I'm a huge Top 40 lover.","Entertainment is such a non-reality.","I actually studied in college, for the three semesters that I stayed in school, I don't recommend that, but I studied theater, and in high school I was involved in the drama department.","I love listening to classical music.","I feel like I'll always be a brunette, that's just who I am, but I love that I can switch it up and be whatever I want to be."],"Katharine Ross":["Funny thing, as you become famous, people write less nice things about you.","I have been fascinated with survival and having to go on no matter what. That always appealed to me.","Maybe I don't have an accurate view of myself. For instance, I keep getting cast as 'The Beautiful Girl,' but I don't happen to think I'm beautiful.","The hell with the aging process. It happens to everyone - you just keep your mind active, you keep physically active.","I made four pictures before 'The Graduate,' and nothing ever happened. And after that - wow!","The hardest thing about becoming famous is trying not to lose yourself. The thing I like best about it is the recognition of my work.","In 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,' I play a schoolteacher who is older than I am in life - and I like that.","When I first came to Hollywood, I couldn't afford a telephone.","I study things like the life cycle of the worm.","I like to sit and talk to someone, and if they want to write about it, OK. But when it's a chore, I have a choice. There's a choice for all of us, including me.","I'm stubborn, which is not necessarily admirable.","Marriage is not different from a relationship.","Marriage has nothing to do with feelings; it just gives children a name.","I don't want to be a big movie star.","I do want to be good at what I do, sometimes for a lot of money and sometimes for none.","I don't have a favorite part. My current part is my favorite part. And when I do the next thing, that will be my favorite part.","I always play what I call The Girl. The nice straight character. Sincere. Usually the victim. I'm put upon. I suffer.","I'm bored. I'm bored with the kind of parts I get offered. I can do more.","I find it embarrassing and disgusting to ask to do a part and be told I'm too pretty. How can I answer that?","I'd like to be able to be like a director, like Richard Brooks, say. And be able to say, 'I did my best, and this is it, and there's nobody to blame but me.'","Acting is important to me, but so is the rest of my life, and what I still keep in mind is that the pressure of being successful lasts so short a time.","You have to know what you want out of your work or out of your life.","Age is so immaterial. Isn't this all just the blink of an eyelash?","There's a period in one's life when beauty is very important. For me, it was high school. But I had a grandmother who kept saying, 'Handsome is as handsome does.' That's always stuck with me.","When you hit 40, you suddenly find that they are looking at younger actresses.","Part of being an actor is never knowing where your next part is coming from."],"Katharine Towne":["If you don't flirt, you're probably dead inside.","Yoga changed my life. I go between 4 and 6 times a week. It's incredibly grounding and an intense level of focus."],"Katharine Weymouth":["My mother doesn't cook; my grandmother didn't cook. Her kids were raised by servants. They would joke about Sunday night dinner. It was the only night she would cook, and apparently it was just horrendous, like scrambled eggs and Campbell's soup.","I don't feel like my job is to be beloved.","I certainly hope to be a great publisher, and if people want to love me, too, that's even better.","Women are often meeker in meetings and afraid to ask for raises and promotions. I've told countless female colleagues to stop apologizing when they ask for more. It's not personal, it's business.","Hillary Clinton famously talked about how raising a child takes a village. Except our society isn't set up that way. We're organized in nuclear units, and a single mom can ask her friends only so many times for help picking up the kids.","Part of my job is to make the tough calls.","I care deeply about journalism, but we need to be a business.","We're no longer a newspaper in the morning, we're a 24/7 newspaper organization.","Moderate to conservative Democrat. But I'm not going to impose my views on the editorial page.","I think I felt like a regular kid. Growing up in New York, I never felt I was a big deal.","My grandmother knew J.F.K. and L.B.J. That was her world. I enjoy meeting interesting people. But that's not my world.","I don't personally feel that I have to save democracy and journalism.","The way I live is really me.","It's not like I pretend the past doesn't exist or that I'm not proud to be a part of it.","People assume that I came back to Washington because of the 'Post', but the truth is less romantic. I came back for a job."],"Katharine Whitehorn":["Outside every thin woman is a fat man trying to get in.","The disease is painless; it's the cure that hurts.","Why do born-again people so often make you wish they'd never been born the first time?","Find out what you like doing best and get someone to pay you for it.","Hats divide generally into three classes: offensive hats, defensive hats, and shrapnel.","The best career advice to give to the young is, 'Find out what you like doing best and get someone to pay you for doing it.'","I am firm. You are obstinate. He is a pig-headed fool.","I am all for people having their heart in the right place; but the right place for a heart is not inside the head.","When it comes to housework the one thing no book of household management can ever tell you is how to begin. Or maybe I mean why.","The easiest way for your children to learn about money is for you not to have any.","From a commercial point of view, if Christmas did not exist it would be necessary to invent it.","No nice men are good at getting taxis.","A food is not necessarily essential just because your child hates it.","A good listener is not someone with nothing to say. A good listener is a good talker with a sore throat.","Have you ever taken something out of the clothes hamper because it had become, relatively, the cleanest thing?","The rule is not to talk about money with people who have much more or much less than you.","Americans, indeed, often seem to be so overwhelmed by their children that they'll do anything for them except stay married to the co-producer.","There are some circles in America where it seems to be more socially acceptable to carry a hand-gun than a packet of cigarettes.","I wouldn't say when you've seen one Western you've seen the lot; but when you've seen the lot you get the feeling you've seen one.","Any committee that is the slightest use is composed of people who are too busy to want to sit on it for a second longer than they have to.","I yield to no one in my admiration for the office as a social center, but it's no place actually to get any work done.","The great rule is not to talk about money with people who have much more or much less than you."],"Kathe Koja":["Darkness might seem to obscure what's happening, but I find it's always pretty revelatory: it brings out the awe in us, the fear in us, the excitement of exploring the hidden or unknown. It seems to conceal, but it really shines a light on what we want, what we need, and what we'll do to get it. Especially when we think no one can see us.","People react differently to puppets than they do to human performers: they become more playful, more open.","My writing process hasn't changed - it's is the same whether I'm working on a Y.A. novel or, as now, a new novel for adults. A lot of reading, a lot of research if the subject warrants it, a lot of sticky notes and scraps of paper - and get to work.","'Under the Poppy' is the love story of Istvan and Rupert, lovers and friends from childhood, who've been parted by jealousy - and a secret betrayal by Istvan's sister, Decca, who also loves Rupert, with whom she runs the brothel called Under the Poppy, where the floozies cater to every taste from saucy to peculiar.","I never consciously choose what I'm going to work on next; I don't have an agenda beyond that attraction. Fortunately, my wonderful agent, Christopher Schelling, knows how I think and points me toward things I might like, which is how I started writing Y.A.","I don't think kids have a problem reading books meant for adults; the problem is on the other side of the fence, a misconception of what one kind of literature is 'supposed' to be, perceived to be, as opposed to another: if it's for kids, it can't be any good; it's got to have been dumbed down and/or sweetened up.","Y.A. wasn't really a specific genre when I was fifteen, but if it was, I would probably have shunned it; I was a huge snob.","I have one rule when adapting any text: nothing gets added; all the words are the original author's own. But in the ordering and recreation of the story, I can do as I please, and to me, the heart and the point of 'Dracula' is appetite.","'Alice in Wonderland' has been done a million times; why do it again? Nerve's answer is that Alice is Everyman and Everywoman, going through the stages of life."],"Kathe Kollwitz":["I do not want to die... until I have faithfully made the most of my talent and cultivated the seed that was placed in me until the last small twig has grown.","Look at life with the eyes of a child.","No longer diverted by other emotions, I work the way a cow grazes.","I want to cultivate the seed that was placed in me until the last small twig has grown.","Genius can probably run on ahead and seek out new ways. But the good artists who follow after genius - and I count myself among these - have to restore the lost connection once more.","While I drew, and wept along with the terrified children I was drawing, I really felt the burden I am bearing. I felt that I have no right to withdraw from the responsibility of being an advocate.","To this day I do not know whether the power which has inspired my works is something related to religion, or is indeed religion itself.","It is my duty to voice the suffering of men, the never-ending sufferings heaped mountain-high."],"Katherine Anne Porter":["It is such a relief to be told the truth.","Human life itself may be almost pure chaos, but the work of the artist is to take these handfuls of confusion and disparate things, things that seem to be irreconcilable, and put them together in a frame to give them some kind of shape and meaning.","It's a man's world, and you men can have it.","I was right not to be afraid of any thief but myself, who will end by leaving me nothing.","I have not much interest in anyone's personal history after the tenth year, not even my own. Whatever one was going to be was all prepared before that.","Experience is what really happens to you in the long run; the truth that finally overtakes you.","Love must be learned, and learned again; there is no end to it.","One of the marks of a gift is to have the courage of it.","The real sin against life is to abuse and destroy beauty, even one's own even more, one's own, for that has been put in our care and we are responsible for its well-being.","Physical infidelity is the signal, the notice given, that all fidelities are undermined.","They had both noticed that a life of dissipation sometimes gave to a face the look of gaunt suffering spirituality that a life of asceticism was supposed to give and quite often did not.","Our being is subject to all the chances of life. There are so many things we are capable of, that we could be or do. The potentialities are so great that we never, any of us, are more than one-fourth fulfilled.","I shall try to tell the truth, but the result will be fiction.","Most people won't realize that writing is a craft. You have to take your apprenticeship in it like anything else."],"Katherine Boo":["We often have an exaggerated sense of what nonprofits and governments are doing to help the poor, but the really inspiring thing is how much the poor are doing to help themselves.","People talk about places like Mumbai as a tale of two cities, as if the rich and poor don't have anything to do with each other.","We talk a lot about infrastructure in cities, and it's talking about highways and it's talking about trains, but I think more important to people who are low income is, how do I get from here to there? How do I become part of the affluence that's surrounding me?","There's some way in which we would prefer not to see very clearly the immense gifts and intelligence of some of the people who live in our most abject conditions. Maybe there are some things at work in deciding who gets to be society's winners and who gets to be society's losers that don't have to do with merit.","I was spending a lot of time in Mumbai after I met my husband, who is Indian, and while parts of the city were prospering like crazy, I couldn't quite make out how the new wealth had changed the prospects of the majority of city residents who lived in slums. So after a few years I stopped wondering and started reporting.","In any country, corruption tends to increase when more respectable means of social advancement break down.","People naturally long for a bit of the wealth that is whorling all around them, and if the work and education available to them won't get them closer to the comforts that they see others enjoying, the temptation to take shortcuts can be fierce.","A great deal of what is presumed to be intractable or inevitable in this world doesn't strike me that way at all.","For myself, suffering doesnt make me a good person; it makes me selfish. Why do we think that people who have less should find it edifying?","I'm not squeamish.","I think it's this congenital problem with journalism that we oversell the difference we make. We make small differences.","I have been dealing with illness and its manifestations since I was a teenager, and I think that gives me a very healthy respect for the things in life we can't control.","When I'm engaged in a story my health is not a big deal, but when I'm not doing anything, if you sit me down, I can get tied up in my own medical dramas. So I much prefer to work.","One thing that was very clear to me is that the young people in a place like Annawadi aren't tripping on caste the way their parents are. They know their parents have these old views.","When your work is nonfiction about low-income communities, pretty much anything that's not nonfiction about low-income communities feels like a guilty pleasure.","I'm useless when I meet writers I love - I go slack-jawed and stupid with awe."],"Katherine Center":["I felt like I had never really heard of a story that reflected the stuff I was going through as a mom. I came up with an idea for a story about motherhood that I would want to read.","We are big composters. We compost everything - bread, tea bags, coffee grounds. I even dump out my old coffee in the garden. We keep a mixing bowl on the counter and just fill it up as the day goes along, then dump it in the mulch pile before dinner and wash it with the dinner dishes.","It's fun to think about plants not just as decorations but as functioning parts of our yard's ecosystem that attract wildlife to the garden. We have hummingbirds, tons of bees, and many monarch butterflies. The kids love it! Though we're very laissez-faire with the garden and never put chemicals on it or even water it much!","I'd love to paint our roof white - it's so hot down here in Texas! - and I'd love to have a rainwater collection system to save rain runoff for later. I also love to fantasize about keeping chickens in the backyard.","I have an affection for tangible objects, like books and pages, but people sure do seem to love their Kindles! We're definitely in the middle of a revolution that will determine how people find, read, and experience stories."],"Katherine Dunham":["I had certain physical limitations that made me change the choreography for myself or made me more interested in choreography only rather than dancing. I have never been a person who wanted to just dance. I have always been interested in developing for other people.","I used to want the words 'She tried' on my tombstone. Now I want 'She did it.'","Black people should have recognition for themselves and their backgrounds and their relationships with other people in the world and thus lose some of their alienation. This museum has certainly stood for that in this town.","The older I grow the more I see the influence of my family on my life. I didn't always see it. It was up to our parents to see that we had our education in a town that hadn't yet realized what racial prejudice was but actually knew and practiced it on occasion.","We don't intend to always keep this necessarily African oriented. Originally I had hoped to have African American Indian of this area, and the Appalachian of this area, but at the same time, just as we have the Haitian room, we will always have room for another exhibit.","A creative person has to create. It doesn't really matter what you create. If such a dancer wanted to go out and build the cactus gardens where he could, in Mexico, let him do that, but something that is creative has to go on.","So many dancers paint. I used to paint. I started again recently. While I was dancing, I was very busy with my career. Start something else that makes use of your creative ability because if you don't you will die inside as a person.","I certainly feel my career was a great career because it inspired so many many people, literally hundreds of people to follow a new kind of life and to realize that they could make out and advance their own professional and private and social lives.","We have a group of friends of the museum who try to raise, if they can, periodically something to help us. Of course, the main thing about a building like this is its upkeep. It needs central heating and it needs central air conditioning.","Haiti itself was also photographed, some of the streets, some of the mountains, rivers, streams, etc. were photographed before talking with me about how I felt about Haiti. Then the camera went to our voodoo temple and saw a serious ceremony, a real ceremony.","I really think that aside from admiring my talent you really admire me as a person and as a woman.","Aside from a few master teachers that we have had over the years, this has been a completely local talent development. But people have started to come now from Chicago, we have a number of students from Chicago and different places of the country and even in the world.","I could never live a nonproductive life and I feel that I have lived a productive life as far as I want to in terms of this company that I have for so many years.","I have actually five honorary degrees.","Don't think you are going to go on forever because you are not and begin to plan something that will compensate as you reduce your capacities to leap or turn on this or that or the other, begin thinking of something else.","You know, this isn't theatre like it used to be.","Without my husband's costumes I wouldn't have known how to accomplish what I saw in my own mind's eyes for choreography. And then seeing our choreography and knowing the background of it I am sure helped my husband a great deal with what he designed for us.","For the kind of thing that we were showing, the budget was sufficient. As we were speaking of in Haiti, we had not done that before in exactly this form and we had to have costumes for it.","I don't think Ed Sullivan had anything to do with Carib Song.","Frequently producers have partners that they never let the public know about.","We had maybe the greatest success of any company that I know of in Paris, and after two or three years I wanted to do this same number that we did for PBS, so we did it and Paris had always considered us their darlings.","Sometimes I have given my husband a manuscript to read that has turned out to have fantastic rave reviews and he'll tell me it is no good. Well, if I didn't know him as well as I know him I would be terribly depressed.","I am happy to know that my husband regards me as a woman and a person.","My work has been much more Caribbean and eclectic. I am interested in people, and where they come from happens to have fallen within an area of Africa."],"Katherine Dunn":["We live with a distinct double standard about male and female aggression. Women's aggression isn't considered real. It isn't dangerous; it's only cute. Or it's always self-defense or otherwise inspired by a man. In the rare case where a woman is seen as genuinely responsible, she is branded a monster - an 'unnatural' woman.","American culture is torn between our long romance with violence and our terror of the devastation wrought by war and crime and environmental havoc.","In boxing, they say it's the punch you don't see coming that knocks you out. In the wider world, the reality we ignore or deny is the one that weakens our most impassioned efforts toward improvement.","Every doorway, every intersection has a story.","Prior to penicillin and medical research, death was an everyday occurrence. It was intimate.","Non-fiction is a big responsibility. Rationality. Facts. The urgent need to reflect some small aspect of reality. But fiction is a private autism, a self-referential world in which the writer is omnipotent. Gravity, taxes, and death are mere options, subject to the writer's fancy.","The intense campaigns against domestic violence, rape, sexual harassment, and inequity in the schools all too often depend on an image of women as weak and victimized.","My handwriting was nothing to write home about, and I had this idea that calligraphy was like taking Latin in high school: that it was one of the bricks, the building bricks, that you had to understand about the forms of writing.","Behind every locked door on Skid Road are a thousand stories.","Perhaps the strongest evidence that women have as broad and deep a capacity for physical aggression as men is anecdotal. And as with men, this capacity has expressed itself in acts from the brave to the brutal, the selfless to the senseless.","I'm like every waitress in every diner; I'm like every mom driving her kids to school. I'm nothing special at all.","Each reader projects their own version of the experience inside their skull as they go along. It's probably true that no two people read exactly the same book.","The more potent, unasked question is how society at large reacts to eager, voluntary violence by females, and to the growing evidence that women can be just as aggressive as men.","In our struggle to restrain the violence and contain the damage, we tend to forget that the human capacity for aggression is more than a monstrous defect, that it is also a crucial survival tool.","Writing nonfiction of various kinds has been instructive and entertaining as well as paying the rent.","The metaphor of the subterranean is at work in a lot of Northwest writers and artists. Zooming in closer and closer and closer, then below, to the worms and the centipede.","Sometimes we followed the crops, doing migrant labor. We did several years of tenant farming in Western Oregon starting in the early '50s. Later, my stepdad managed gas stations in a small town near Portland.","My background is standard American blue collar of the itchy-footed variety. We're new-world mongrels. The women in the family read horoscopes, tea leaves, coffee bubbles, Tarot cards and palms.","There are those whose own vulgar normality is so apparent and stultifying that they strive to escape it. They affect flamboyant behaviour and claim originality according to the fashionable eccentricities of their time. They claim brains or talent or indifference to mores in desperate attempts to deny their own mediocrity.","My lip curls in a snide reflex whenever I hear that a new novel is written from the point of view of a child or a monster, a lunatic or an animal. I immediately expect a nasty coyness of tone, cheesy artifice, the world through cardboard 3-D lenses.","My own theory about the phlegmatic qualities and properties of the English is the mountain of pure white sugar hydrocarbons they consume every day bloody day of the year - the stiff upper lip is petrified sugar; that's Bermuda's revenge, the with death, the rotting future square in the teeth of it.","An intimate core of my being recognizes that there is nothing in me that can go on: there is no spark; there is no infestation of vaporous miasma that has the capacity to continue, and there is nothing in me that wishes to continue. This moment is, for me, all that there is, and I'm willing to accept it. I'm a worm; I have no soul.","At its heart, 'Fat City' is not about boxing. It is a universal story of grim realities and toxic delusions. It is awash with awareness of chances blown, dreams stymied, precious time wasted, and all future prospects scorched to ashes by the process.","Well, it arose out of two long-term concerns - the first being the possibility of genetic manipulation, nature versus nurture, what constitutes how people get to be how they are.","I have been a believer in the magic of language since, at a very early age, I discovered that some words got me into trouble and others got me out.","I think genetic research is a fascinating and fertile area.","The second is the structure and source of cults. They have always haunted me, and I wanted to explore the fundamental notion of giving up responsibility to an outside power.","I come from a family of great readers and storytellers.","Let's just say, the American school of suburban angst is not my cup of tea.","But I think everybody should write. I think those people with stories who don't write should be stomped on.","But I went to high school in a Portland suburb and went to college here.","I think that it's really important to go away and come back.","We're also far enough from the publishing power that we have no access to the politics of publishing, although there are interpersonal politics, of course.","But the animation has become very good, and I think that a movie is not a book, and a book is not a movie.","What I think happens, and that you have to acknowledge though, is that a director uses a book as a launching pad for his own work and that's always very flattering.","I know if I were in your generation I would be really tired of seeing Sophia Loren as a sex object.","Asked why they wanted to fight, the young women said they enjoyed it, just as some men and boys do.","But the idea that women can't take care of themselves still permeates our culture.","This idea that males are physically aggressive and females are not has distinct drawbacks for both sexes.","Training of female athletes is so new that the limits of female possibility are still unknown.","And while national military forces have historically resisted the full participation of women soldiers, female talent has found plenty of scope in revolutionary and terrorist groups around the planet.","There should be unemployment insurance for fictional people.","Most professional fighters, male and female, hold day jobs, but the women's game attracts a wide social spectrum: hash slingers, teachers, police officers, landscapers, stuntwomen. Many are wives and mothers. Their husbands or boyfriends work their corners, or hide in arena restrooms, scared to watch their bouts.","In the United States, female fisticuffs were marginalized, first as erotic vaudeville in the 19th century and later as serious competition developed in the first half of the 20th. Legal wars waged by boxers in the 1960s and '70s won women the right to compete professionally nationwide.","Anthropologists believe women were among the skilled boxers of the ancient, sport-loving Minoan culture that flourished on Crete until 1100 B.C. The boxing booths at English fairs featured women in the 19th and early 20th centuries.","Only one sport can subsume my life at a time.","I was reading a lot of European history, and I thought Attila the Hun had gotten a bad rap.","I'm slow by everybody's standards. But not by mine.","The denial of female aggression is a destructive myth. It robs an entire gender of a significant spectrum of power, leaving women less than equal with men and effectively keeping them 'in their place' and under control.","Boxing gyms are more than training facilities. They are sanctuaries in bad neighborhoods for troubled kids and shrines to the traditions of the sport. The gym is home. For many, it's the safest place they know.","A boxing gym is a place where men are allowed to be kind to one another.","I see my writing as the process of looking at the usual, but from two steps to the side.","We came to Portland because there was a good alternative public school. Friends who lived there told me about it, and my son loved it. I left his dad and went to work slinging hash in a breakfast diner and working nights tending bar in a biker tavern.","People have been trying for centuries to manipulate genes, enhance certain traits, and achieve racial purity, even in humans. And of course I thought of the Nazis and their efforts toward Aryan magnificence.","I hate to tell you this, but I did not know what the National Book Award was when I got the call.","I don't like to see anyone suffer, and there's a very, very fine line between being healthy and working and totally down and out.","My mother is an escaped farm girl from North Dakota and a self-taught artist and painter.","My dad was a third-generation printer and linotype operator, by all accounts a fabulous ballroom dancer. He was jettisoned from the family before I was 2, and I have never met him and have no memory of him.","A true freak cannot be made. A true freak must be born.","We're living in a high-tech world. So much of our stimulus and entertainment comes from things that are quite abstract and disembodied.","Boxing is a formal, ritualized creation of crisis.","The things we do to our children - most of the evil in the world is not done with bad intentions but with the best intentions ever.","I thought if I just told the truth, the human truth, it'd be the truth for everyone.","It took seventeen years to get from my second novel, 'Truck,' to my third, 'Geek Love.'","Fiction, even when it's grim and hard, is fun.","No, I've never competed. I did, however, train in a boxing gym with a good coach beginning in 1993. I'd been writing about the sport for a dozen years by then and wanted to know what boxers endured, what it felt like. I was too old to compete when I started, but I sparred enough to get a taste.","Women are real. Our reality covers the whole human megillah, from feeble to fierce, from bad to good, from endangered to dangerous. We don't just deserve power, we have it. And power in this and every other society is not just the capacity to benefit those around us.","It is time to recognize the variability of females, just as we do males.","I'm just a regular Joe.","In a really good, closely matched situation, the style of the boxer is every bit as explicit and specific to him as a painter's hand.","Some writers get snooty about what happens when their books are adapted to film, but I don't feel that way.","Film is a different art form with its own demands and its own riches.","A film adaptation is, I hope, the director's version. A new creation.","Donald Westlake's lean prose and deadpan delivery are engaging, as always.","I don't think there is such a thing as an idea without words, because your language is your thought.","I think it is the natural and innate function of certain organisms to secrete beauty in permanent forms we call artworks, to respond to beauty by answering its discovery with a new beauty.","I thought that was actually kind of boring, that search for perfection.","In boxing, it just seemed to me from the time I was a very small child, we have a peculiarly civilized form in that boxers don't screech and holler. They don't use weapons. When the bell rings, they fight; when the bell rings again, they stop."],"Katherine Harris":["We're not going to pay attention to the silliness and the petty comments. And quite frankly, women have joined me in this effort, and so it's not about appearances. It's about effectiveness.","Everyone has said very supportive things coming out of D.C. today. We can't wait when the race has begun.","This is about Floridians saying what's most important to them and making sure that we create an agenda that we can drive and deliver back in Washington, D.C. So it's very exciting.","Well, you know, what's so exciting, is that it was a really telling campaign as well. Whenever we start looking at the differences, they could never be more clear.","You know, this is not about endorsements in the primary. We have to get through a primary first.","So when we start talking about the state and all those that are so important and engaged and supportive around Florida, we've gotten overwhelming support, and it's so exciting.","If you're not electing Christians, then in essence you are going to legislate sin.","We have to have the faithful in government.","I followed the law. Before God, before the law, before the people of the state of Florida who elected me, I know that I followed the law.","As long as I do a good job, I believe the future is going to take care of itself, but actually I like very much being in elected office and there is no consideration about doing anything different until I can be assured that we are going to have the best voting systems in the country.","I believe that George Bush won the election through the vote of the people and the way our republic is set up. All we did was follow the law in the Department of State.","Certainly I had my preference, and I very much hoped that George W. Bush would be our next president.","The appearance doesn't matter as much as the content.","If Al Gore had allowed us and if the Florida Supreme Court had not intervened and rewritten the law, which they're not supposed to do, we could have certified, which is a mere procedural action, and then after that, they could have petitioned any justice for a recount statewide with uniform standards.","I am a bit biased. I co-chair the campaign effort of George W. Bush.","No partisan political activity transpired in my office during the recount period."],"Katherine Heigl":["Smoking sucks! The one thing I would say to my kid is, 'It's not just that it's bad for you. Do you want to spend the rest of your life fighting a stupid addiction to a stupid thing that doesn't even really give you a good buzz?'","My worst habit used to be smoking but I quit.","As women, we have more of a tendency to be people-pleasers, and I know a lot of women who are not vocal about what makes them happy.","My good friends are Mormon, some of the best people I know.","I'm too lazy and I like food and I like my free time too much to spend it working out!","I definitely want to go out and explore different personalities and different people.","I want to stay in the moment and enjoy the great things that are happening.","Of course, of course I'm grateful. How can I not be grateful? I have been afforded such a wonderful life.","A girl told me my lips looked like somebody had pressed strawberry yogurt against my face.","I'm a talker. I love a good debate.","I spent so many years just saying what I felt without thinking about the ramifications, without understanding that I have this opinion but not everyone might share that opinion and now they don't like me because of it.","Hollywood likes to label everyone so you're easier to identify.","I've never really been America's sweetheart, but for a minute I think that's what they wanted me to be.","I was the youngest child and really spoiled. I loved to play make-believe. I loved pretending to be all kinds of different people and it just seemed natural that I would go into acting.","I'm not out burning bras, but I'm very opinionated about women owning their power.","I've had paranoid panic attacks.","Guys are kind of retarded until they're about 30.","It's more fun to think that there are other worlds.","I prefer a kiss that is so much more than just a tongue in your mouth.","Adoption has been a part of my life and a part of my family, so it was how I wanted to start. It felt natural and right to me.","Isn't it so weird the day you wake up and you're just going with the flow? And you just suddenly are a mom.","If I spread myself too thin, I'm not a good actor, I'm not a good mother, and I'm just really high-strung - and everybody hates me.","My mother is a realist, and she's had biological and adoptive children, and she said it's no different: No matter what, they're putting a stranger into your arms. You don't know them yet.","I'm not really a first-move kind of gal.","My career is really important to me, but there have to be other great, important things in your life besides work.","It's easy to be taken advantage of if you're not honest.","I'm really proud of myself because I've pared my beauty regimen down to a cream blush and berry-tinted lip balm, which has saved me so much time.","When something disappointing happened, my mother would remind me not to let that become my focus. There's still so much to be grateful for.","Kids are a huge sacrifice; they change everything - but I'm ready to work for things of greater importance than going out to meet someone for dinner at 10 o'clock at night.","I decided I was sick of trying to figure out what everybody else wanted, and I should just decide what I want, and be honest, and not spend all my time guessing.","I'm terrible with patience.","My mother is a great source of advice and wisdom and consolation for me.","There were so many lean years. A lot of lean years.","If I start going back to church, I'd have to stop the smoking and drinking, and I wouldn't be able to curse any more.","Marriage is actually really terrifying. It doesn't work for many people.","I haven't been to rehab, I don't do anything eccentric - I'm really boring.","Some people think, if you're in the public eye, that you have to have an answer for everything and it has to be boring.","I still love the theology of the Mormon religion and think it is a wonderful way to grow up.","I'm realising now that I can't just blurt things out.","If I have to be focused and watch what I say, then I have to be comfortable.","There are some things that, if you say them out loud, will hurt the other person's feelings. I tend to say them anyway. It's better to be honest.","I'm the most uncoordinated clumsy, klutzy person. I always had a bruise, I always tripped and fell.","So much about living life, to me, is about humility and gratitude. And I've tried very hard to have those qualities and be that person and I'm just so disappointed in myself that I allowed it to slip.","I never would rule out a great character or a great story. I don't care what the forum is. If I get to tell a story that I'm excited about, I'm in.","We are all human beings, part of the human race, and we need to be compassionate and giving and kind with one another.","The world is still very bigoted.","A lot of children don't find forever homes because they're on that special-needs list, even if it's because of something as simple as her mother smoked cigarettes for a month, not knowing she was pregnant.","It's lame to say that I'm a normal girl, but I think I am.","I don't have a lot of discipline.","If I wasn't in this industry, I wouldn't work out.","I pride myself on being kind.","I'm not terribly sentimental.","I don't make big grand gestures, generally.","I have my moments, but generally speaking I shy away from being too lovey dovey.","My sister is Korean and my parents adopted her about three years before I was born and that is how I grew up.","I want my family to resemble the family I came from.","I am a better mother for having something in my life and not just my children.","I just ultimately wanted to be a mother. I love children.","The mouthier I got, the more I'd be celebrated.","I totally wouldn't mind being able to wave my hand head to toe and have, like, a whole new outfit.","I'm not always so nice.","I'm done with the whole idea of having my own children. It doesn't seem like any fun.","I just like to shake things up, and your hair is one way to do it.","Guys are much more obvious than they think they are.","I'm terrible with my workout regime and following it strictly. I'm terrible with a healthy diet and following it strictly. I'm terrible on the weekends about getting up at reasonable hours and all of those things. But, when it comes to my work and the discipline it takes to get to work on time - I hate unprofessionalism.","I like predictability because I know what I'm getting into.","I'd be a terrible secret agent. I can't keep a secret and I'm not sneaky.","I have bad feet and I have weak ankles.","I keep kind of making certain mistakes in public appearances over and over again.","I can hide, and my husband's just terrible at finding me. I do like to jump out from behind doors and scare him.","I've created a chaotic life, and then I get on edge because of it.","I overdramatize.","Even if you plan a marriage and a family, you are never quite prepared for the reality versus how you imagined it. In a lot of ways it's better, and in a lot of ways it's worse. That's life, right?","Obviously my career's important to me and I'm really, really passionate about trying to keep it.","I don't want to be the person digging my own grave.","I think that everybody has a right to their own thoughts, their own feelings and their own private moments, if they want them.","In my career, I'm very grateful for the opportunities.","I do like change. That's the one thing exciting about me.","I like going on location for films.","I'm a sappy mom now. I didn't think I would be. I thought I'd be a cool mom who keeps everything in perspective.","I can't cultivate a relationship with my child if it's between takes. I tried that on a movie and realized, 'This is not going to work.' It will work some of the year, but not 12 months a year.","I'm not very good at being a wife because I break all the rules.","I look back at my twenties and see that I was much less confident.","I think a lot of women innately know how to play their hand. I'm not a big one for the rules.","I always assume I look better than I actually do. I'll feel pretty good about myself when I leave the house, then I'll see a picture and think, 'Crap, I had no idea that's what I was looking like.'","I'm never satisfied with the way I look.","I think that I always loved being the centre of attention!","I used to weigh myself every day at a certain time of day. Then I would write down the number and measure my body fat. It wasn't a healthy way to live.","When I see some of the people who are glorified in magazines these days - who are so thin it's bordering on sickness - I just feel exhausted.","People make mistakes - they say things they shouldn't have or didn't necessarily mean. But I strongly believe in consequences. If there are none, someone might feel like they've gotten away with something, or that what they said couldn't have been that bad.","When I do get pregnant, I highly doubt I'll be one of those women who don't look pregnant from behind - I'll be that chick who looks pregnant from her ankles up!"],"Katherine Helmond":["I was never ambitious to be a good actor. I just love doing it and I seem to be quite suited for it.","I was very lucky with 'Soap' and 'Who's the Boss,' which was great fun, and then went on 'Coach' and 'Everybody Loves Raymond.' I've been truly blessed, and the work has all been fun and a joy.","I grew up hearing about the walking undead. I had a fascination with it as a child.","A director recommended me for the role on 'Soap.' They said, 'She plays heavy roles, murderesses and the like.' He said, 'On stage, she could be very very funny.'","I went to Catholic school. Do as you're told; don't ask questions and you will be illuminated.","I had TB as a child. So I was put to doing things like drawing and reading. And I was raised in a family where manners were important. Maybe that's why I seem so refined.","I'd really like to show women my age - who've had children grow up or lost husbands or retired after working all their lives - that there are options. There are choices. We don't have to just sit around and be invisible.","Women have been brought up to be passive, accepting, not come forward and play a major role in life. And with age, there's a tendency to revert to that - to pull back, recede. I don't think it's advisable or admirable.","The choice of roles as I grow older gets more and more limited, so if I pin myself to one kind of part I would get in trouble. So, these oddball ladies came along for me to do - I guess Terry Gilliam helped in this respect. I have found them more interesting, flashier and I get more mileage out of them.","Many times, when a director reads a script and wants somebody who says 'Far out', then they let me do what I want with it and that's usually more interesting for an actor."],"Katherine Jenkins":["When I dance, I forget everything else and just feel completely happy.","Children should be able to live a life free from bullying and harassment and it is time that we all took a stand against this.","Confidence is one of the sexiest things.","I have such happy memories of performing in a choir and I don't think I'd have got where I am today without all that experience. So my advice to young singers is to either join your school or church's choir or find one in your local area. Choral music at any level teaches you so much about musicianship and blending your voice.","I'm a Cancerian, the typical crab with the tough outer shell and the soft bit in the middle. I don't think I'll ever come to terms with people being unnecessarily nasty, but I can take it if someone doesn't like my music - I'm not everyone's cup of tea.","Everything in my career is my decision - every picture, every outfit. You get one chance at this, and I never saw myself as being a puppet.","I would absolutely, definitely never sell my wedding pictures to a magazine. I'd like it to be a special day, not a photo shoot. And once you've done that, your marriage becomes everybody else's business.","I am fussy, about my diet and straining my voice. I know, sounds a bit over the top. But I'm not as bad as I used to be. These days I don't drink alcohol for five days before a show - very dehydrating for the vocal cords, and all that acid reflux. I used to ban it for a fortnight. Nightmare.","2012 was the year I saw Twitter as a negative. More people need to realise that not everything they read is true and that Internet trolls are a real problem.","Oh, stuff the critics. I don't care. Too many people are snooty about classical. Look, I wasn't brought up in a home where we listened to classical music. It was a singing teacher that thought it would be best for my voice. Then I moved into crossover. And if that makes the music accessible to more people, then great.","Beatbullying's 'The Big March 2012' is such a brilliant campaign and I am very proud to be a part of it. I have been a victim of cyber bullying myself and I know firsthand just how hurtful it can be. People think that they can hide behind computers and send nasty and hurtful comments to people, and this is wrong.","When I did 'Dancing with the Stars' I did lose an awful lot of weight and I think at the time everybody was sort of alarmed by it. You can eat anything and it is still dropping off you when you are doing that amount of exercise.","I want to have kids. I want to get married. That is still very important to me.","If you love somebody, you love them. My parents had a 25-year age gap between them and my mum was the breadwinner, my dad the house husband. I'm a strong believer that a good relationship can work, whatever the situation.","People see you sing in a certain way, in a long dress, and you are put on a pedestal like you have never made a mistake in your life.","My music appeals in America. There is less of the purist criticism I get here. And to be a hit in the U.S... what singer doesn't have that dream?","I can't leave the studio until everything is as it should be. And I can't put a record out unless I am completely happy with it. I never want to be at a signing and hear my album playing and think, 'Oh no, I could have done that top note better.'","My idol was Marilyn Monroe, who was a size 16, I think, and curvy in all the right places. I will never be stick thin. I remember a shoot where I had to get into these tiny hot pants, and I thought, 'God, I wish I hadn't eaten.'","Yes. I do about 70 shows a year, in the past year I've been to Italy, Australia, Japan, China, just about everywhere. I do it because I love singing. The money is a bonus.","I wasn't the best in my class at the Royal Academy. There was a really good soprano and baritone who were technically better and are doing really well in opera now. But I was definitely the best mezzo-soprano in my class, because I was the only one of those!","People perceive opera and classical as elitist - I disagree. I've always tried to mix the two, make it more accessible.","I have a long fuse.","I'm launching my own festival in South Wales. It's something I've wanted to do for a long time. It's going to be held at Margam Park, because I wanted the venue to be as close to my home as possible.","For me, with the Blue Man Group, I got asked. It was for the Royal Variety Show, which was something I always wanted to be a part of. I'm really interested in things people don't necessarily expect. I did a pop song, but I did it in my own style.","I love to listen to pop music and I admire people who do that, but I don't think I would ever be a very good pop star. I always leave that singing voice for the shower! I wouldn't put it out in the world!","The diva tag just won't go away. I think that's because people want me to be like that. It makes it more interesting if I have thrown a phone at somebody or a water bottle. Sadly that's just not me.","I really see myself as a homegirl. Wales is my first home. London is my second home - I've been there 14 years now.","After doing 'Doctor Who,' I'm open-minded to doing more acting. Part of the reason you do a show like this is because it creates other opportunities you haven't had before.","I think maybe because of the kind of music I sing, people want to believe you're a diva. They can't believe after eight years, and eight albums, you're still relatively sane. I feel like they almost want me to throw something at somebody.","In Heaven, I believe my dad is somewhere doing something nice. I feel I've been too lucky to travel this far without somebody guiding me.","Growing up with my family gave me some of my best memories. I'd like to have a family of my own - slip away for a bit and do nothing but spend those early years with my children.","I am a perfectionist.","You learn your lessons from the mistakes you make, not the things you achieve.","I love coming back to Neath - this is home and always will be.","I was such a geek in school.","I sing a mixture of everything from opera, folk music, Broadway. It's a mix of things.","With 'Believe' bringing really big success for me outside of the U.K. for the first time, it meant I have been touring around the world and that led to a gap from the studio. I really feel like the gap has done me the world of good. Throughout that time I was able to collect songs that I really loved.","I always want to give my best and do the best I can. I know when I have sung my best and when I haven't. There can be stresses and hassles with time travel and press attention. I just have to adapt and find a way of dealing with it.","I wish I got a little bit more time at home. I am away a lot and being around my loved ones and friends is good for me. It grounds me. It's something I need to make more time for. I think I need a little more balance.","I go home and don't get treated any differently. People have known me all my life and are interested and very supportive but because they have known me forever I don't get any diva treatment. My mum still tells me off if I haven't loaded the dishwasher for her.","I'm not naturally a person that wants to exercise, but I find running is something I can do wherever I am in the world.","I do follow a version of the Dukan diet, but I don't follow it to the extreme so a lot of fish and vegetables. If I want chocolate I'll let myself have a bit of chocolate in moderation.","At the weekend, one of the paparazzi left their lunch box filled with half-eaten pasta salad on my doorstep: it was like a little warning, you know? 'We have been here.'","I've only ever wanted to be a singer; I never wanted to be famous.","With all the hundreds of dresses and shoes I have, it would be an absolute crime if I don't have a little girl. I have a whole room at home filled with my stage wear.","I do not understand where the idea came from that opera is only for privileged people, I am as happy singing before 70,000 people at the Millennium Stadium, as I am in front of a few hundred in a small concert hall.","Marilyn Monroe was supposedly a size 16, which is probably why I love her style; it suits me better.","I'd love to play Carmen - it's the perfect mezzo role.","My mother and father were perfect role models. They were together for 25 years and very much in love. But I've got too much to do now. I'm only 27.","I did once shatter a chandelier. I was singing with my college choir in Wales. I was the soloist and I hit the high note and there was this massive bang and all this glass came down from the ceiling. I'd like that to be my party trick if I can perfect it.","From as young as I can remember, I always wanted to be a singer... My mum taught me 'Going Down the Garden to Eat Worms' for a competition when I was about 4.","If my mum thinks I'm acting like a diva she'll soon tell me off... She'll cut me down to size!","I always choose songs that I have an emotional connection to, and I often feel myself getting very emotional when I sing.","I have to believe that I know what's best for me. For instance, I choose all my songs. I never record anything I don't want to record. No one tells me what concerts to do.","I have never called myself an opera singer. Other people do, but I always call myself a classical singer. I'd love to do opera, but I'm still too young and I don't want to do it until I'm ready. I realise that when I do that it's going to be... up for discussion, shall we say, so I want to get it right.","I'm a huge supporter of the military. I think they do an incredible job. So when I get invited to go out and sing for them, some of the best moments of my life.","Being a question on 'The Weakest Link,' that was quite a moment.","I get 'voluptuous' a lot, or 'shapely,' but the fact is that as you get older you learn to embrace your body type. I wasn't able to do that until I was at least 23.","I really feel confident about my dancing now, so I hope there could be a place for me in the West End or on Broadway - maybe a musical, maybe my own show.","I'm still a Welsh girl at heart so I'm staying in the U.K. for the Olympics, it's such an exciting time for Britain so it's amazing to be a part of it.","I've always said that I count myself as a classical crossover artist. To be so, you have to have the core classical training, which I did for many, many years, but also be interested in the pop side of things. You can fit in somewhere in the middle. I feel I do that really well.","Singing has always been my big passion and I would love to be able to go to the U.S. and perform more.","You're now getting a new breed of people like Il Divo and Andrea Bocelli and I think that's why people feel less intimidated by classical music than they once did.","For stage wear and gowns, Julien McDonald, who is a friend of mine. I love that he can be totally over the top for stage wear!","I've been lucky that I've performed with a lot of the classical people I've wanted to work with so I'd like to do something that people didn't see coming. Like Madonna, or being Welsh - the Tom Jones thing. Or somebody suggested N-Dubz - that would be brilliant!","I'm over the moon to be involved in the 'Doctor Who' Christmas special. I can't quite believe it as it's a part of the family tradition at the Jenkins household. I heard the news that I got the role on my 30th birthday and it was the best birthday present ever."],"Katherine Johnson":["Girls are capable of doing everything men are capable of doing. Sometimes they have more imagination than men.","Like what you do, and then you will do your best.","Take all the courses in your curriculum. Do the research. Ask questions. Find someone doing what you are interested in! Be curious!","We will always have STEM with us. Some things will drop out of the public eye and will go away, but there will always be science, engineering, and technology. And there will always, always be mathematics.","I don't have a feeling of inferiority. Never had. I'm as good as anybody, but no better.","I like to learn. That's an art and a science.","I counted everything. I counted the steps to the road, the steps up to church, the number of dishes and silverware I washed... anything that could be counted, I did.","Everything was so new - the whole idea of going into space was new and daring. There were no textbooks, so we had to write them.","Let me do it. You tell me when you want it and where you want it to land, and I'll do it backwards and tell you when to take off.","I was excited at something new, always liked something new, but give credit to everybody who helped. I didn't do anything alone but try to go to the root of the question and succeeded there.","We needed to be assertive as women in those days - assertive and aggressive - and the degree to which we had to be that way depended on where you were. I had to be.","Go see 'Hidden Figures,' and take a young person! It will give a more positive outlook on what is possible if you work hard, do your best, and are prepared.","I'm always interested in learning something new.","Everything is physics and math.","I was just excited to have challenging work to do and smart people to work with.","In math, you're either right or you're wrong.","I found what I was looking for at Langley. This was what a research mathematician did. I went to work every day for 33 years happy. Never did I get up and say I don't want to go to work.","Our teachers made such a difference - all my teachers and professors were very supportive and nurturing.","I had a very, very interesting childhood, but, oh my, education was the primary focus in our family.","Many professors tell you that you'd be good at this or that, but they don't always help you with that career path.","Men don't pay attention to small things.","I felt most proud on the success of the Apollo mission.","I see a picture right now that's not parallel, so I'm going to go straighten it. Things must be in order.","John Glenn's life will long be remembered for his time in space, his courage, and his service to all Americans.","I liked working with smart people."],"Katherine Kelly":["So many people say you have to remember to grab hold of your bride or groom and spend time with them. I think if we had done a traditional wedding, we would have been doing it for everyone else, but this was about the two of us.","In the Depression, big musicals made a comeback.","You've got to be brave.","Becoming a mother has turned my world upside down, but in a really good way - it's the best.","You should see the way I walk around on the way to the nursery. I look a state.","Don't be fooled. Looks can be deceptive. Like every working mother, I'm paddling away like a duck beneath the water.","I'm quite happy being single.","As for getting married, I don't have strong feelings, really - I can take or leave it.","I've got a really good network that includes friends who all had babies within eight weeks of each other, plus my sister, a lovely part-time nanny and a nursery where Orla goes for half days.","I always look so different in different roles, people are never quite sure. Which is the way I like it.","I've had a fantastic time at 'Coronation Street,' and I'm chuffed at the reaction to Becky. It's been this lovely redemption story, and I think that's what the viewers have enjoyed about it.","When I left 'Coronation Street,' I wondered if I could ever be lucky enough to work with such a unanimously wonderful company of good people - and I've just come to that good bunch again.","I take one day at a time. I've always been like that.","I agree with my mother that having children removes a layer of skin that you never grow back.","I always took 'Coronation Street' a year at a time anyway. It was the 50th anniversary; I'd been there five years. It just felt right to leave.","We take each week as it comes; we're juggling just like everybody else. It's all about spinning plates.","Our Sunday evenings tend to be quiet and relaxing, and we try to go to bed early before the start of another busy week.","It's better to have tried and failed than never tried, you can rest easy knowing you gave it a go.","I don't do resolutions, as I am a rebel without a cause in that respect - I always break them by the second of Jan.!","I remember, when I was a teenager, 'Pride And Prejudice' came out. We hadn't had a period drama for ages, and were all glued to it, and for the next three years, Jane Austen series were being made.","I miss everyone on 'Coronation Street,' but I don't miss playing Becky.","The next series of 'Mr Selfridge' has moved on five years. It's 1914 now, and the war is brewing. Halfway through the series, some of the Selfridges staff have to go off to fight, so they get women in to do the men's jobs.","The RSC changed my career, and 'Coronation Street' changed my life.","I can't imagine soaps will ever stop, because people will always watch as long as they have great stories and characters. But the soaps will have to keep evolving, won't they?","I'm 30; I don't have any commitments, and there are great parts out there that I want to play.","It sounds so boring - and my brothers tease, 'Oh poor you, pulling pretend pints all day' - but it's very, very long hours, and you're knackered when you get home.","My mum and dad's hobby was amateur dramatics.","One of my first memories is running up and down the theatre at Wakefield Opera House.","Whenever there was a show like 'Calamity Jane,' me and my siblings would be plonked on stage in a costume because it was easier to have us in it rather than sort out babysitters.","If I had a penny for every time I've been asked if I'm going to work in America.","I've got a green card, so I can work there any time, but I hate reading about actors going to America, because it's not like that anymore.","I know lots of people who work in the U.S. but don't live there.","I remember trying to explain the class system to a Canadian friend when we started at RADA. The funniest thing was when I told her what bonfire night is all about. It's quite dark when you start breaking it down.","I'm delighted to join the cast of 'Field Of Blood: The Dead Hour.'","I'm really looking forward to filming in Glasgow with a top-class cast and crew.","I've already been married six times in my career as an actress - twice as Becky - so I think a wedding of my own might feel too much like work!","I'm a good old Yorkshire girl in that I don't like to talk about things that are on tick. As my nana always said, 'Until you've bought it, it's not yours,' so until it's signed on the dotted line, I don't like to talk about it.","I've never been a person to wish for stuff - I just take it as it comes.","What is happening now to me in my career is amazing, so I dwell on the things that are happening rather than the things that aren't, because what's the point? It doesn't make them happen.","It's been great for me to play a real baddie.","When I read the diary of former 'Daily Mirror' editor Piers Morgan, I realised it was a tough old world to be part of.","All I know is Andrew Davies is an amazing writer; I adore the scripts. I think that Jeremy Piven is outstanding.","There are lots of people in my life I just don't get the chance to see as much as I would like.","I used to work at a pub called The Miner's Rest, and the landlord, Dennis, taught me how to pour a proper pint - it's the type of place where the regulars would send their drinks back if they weren't right.","I initially went into 'Coronation Street' for three months. If they had said back then, 'Do you want to do it for six years?' I probably would have said, 'I don't think so.'","The novelty of corsets and dresses and hats very soon wears off.","I would always consider going back to 'Coronation Street.'","It's hard when something's bigged up because you want people to watch it, so you have to promote it. It'd be great if it was the old-fashioned days when there was no press, and you just switched on and thought, 'Oh, God, what's going on?'","I love going to other people's weddings, but I have never desired a big white wedding for myself, and it has never been put on me as a pressure, an expectation.","I'm a very separate person to my job.","Even at home, I don't have pictures on the wall of jobs I've done.","Awards go up at Mum and Dad's, but home is home, and I don't like to bring the office home.","My parents are really honest when they watch something. My nan is brutally honest. She'll tell me, 'Oh, you looked awful in that scene,' and I'm like, 'Well, I was giving birth at the time, so it probably worked with the character, Nan.'","I enjoy what I'm doing at the moment and try not to think too much about the future.","I was excited when I first got the call, when I heard BBC Four were making a biography and they were interested in me being a part of it.","I've sort of overlapped every job that I've done, really.","I just take every script as it comes along and take it from there.","There's no point daydreaming about what you want to play, because there might never be a script with that part in.","The police who did our training said 'Happy Valley' is one of the only police programmes they can watch and not burst out laughing, saying, 'As if you'd do that.' They think it's really authentic.","I bought the 'Happy Valley' DVD because Steve Pemberton was in it.","I've got a great husband who's very good with Orla - she's a real daddy's girl.","You just need a good plan and then a back-up plan!","If you drop a line in the theatre, you can usually find a way round it. But you can't do that as easily on television - you're in the hands of too many people.","I take my hat off to working mums and especially single working mums. I honestly don't know how they do it.","I don't think, as a journalist, I'd ever get a story written. I'd probably spend five years researching it, and by the time I'd finish it, no one would be interested in it anymore.","I'd be a terrible journalist. I wouldn't want to pry; I just don't have that nature.","I couldn't knock on people's door; if they answered the door and said, 'I don't want to speak to you,' I'd be like, 'Oh, OK then - I wouldn't either, to be honest.'","I have been listening to people's advice. Being a parent, you need all the advice you can get.","You can't go back to work unless you have a great support network, whatever that is. My mum and dad, sister, and husband are great.","We have a part-time nanny who does a few afternoons a week. We have a nursery.","I get weepy even watching the news.","I wouldn't put myself on the same pedestal as Sarah Lancashire.","I don't really get a buzz from playing characters that are similar to me 'cause that's not acting to me.","That's the great thing about 'Corrie': it is an ensemble cast, and it didn't rest on one person's shoulders by any means.","There's no sort of hierarchy at 'Corrie.' The crew get on.","I'm always proud to be in something that's good.","It's lovely being in a hit.","Until I'm actually stood on the set doing the job, I always keep my options open.","Any aspirational job is tough because everyone wants to do it.","I have many close male friends.","I really like lads and grew up with two brothers and all of their mates. I'm also close to several actors that I've played opposite.","Maybe having to pretend to be in love with someone and then jump into bed with them breaks the ice very quickly; friendship follows fast.","As an actress, weekends can be spent working, but my husband, Ryan, works regular hours as an analytics manager for L'Oreal.","In the evening, we either go to the cinema or stay in and get a takeaway - my favourites are Chinese or Indian.","On Sunday, we will Skype relatives - my brother lives in America, my best friend is in Canada, and Ryan's family are all in Australia."],"Katherine LaNasa":["Sometimes you can just not spend that much money or do a minor change with color on a certain room, and it just can open up and brings people a lot of joy. They can go from hating a room or hating a house to loving it.","I love Louisiana, and I love being from there.","I personally like to hang out with people; if I'm playing their mom, I'd like to go have lunch with the kid, and I want to try to spend as much time with people that I can while we are working together if we're supposed to have a familiar relationship with them, because I think it reads.","When I first met Robert Patrick, I died - he is so scary looking - he is a scary looking man."],"Katherine Langford":["Often, when you're growing up, you don't know what's wrong. We don't talk openly enough about mental illness. How do you know - especially today with the incredibly high stress teens are put under during high school - if you have depression or if you have a mental illness or if you have anxiety? You don't know, because you've never seen it.","Bullying has existed forever. Everyone has dealt with it, and teenagers, regardless of where they are, are dealing with the same stuff growing up.","What's important is for us to be aware that our actions have repercussions.","Don't let yourself be small because you want to fit in.","This may just be me, but I feel like everyone's dream is to live as an American high school student. There are so many teen films set in America that you live vicariously through them, anyway.","To be honest, there is no place like home.","Anything written in the French Revolution, that kind of era, is so poignant.","I got into history when I was 11 years old, and it all started with the Titanic. I'd read books in the library about it. Of course I've seen the movie, too - I don't think I've ever cried that much.","I'm a big historical-fiction fan.","Being depressed is not a beautiful tragedy - it's hell and it's agony. Posting photos of someone that you don't have the consent for is illegal, and that's a huge, huge issue. We need to be teaching consent, and that's not just for photos.","I have never been attracted to increasing my popularity or hireability by being on Instagram.","I've always been a little left-of-center at school.","I loved music, acting, and drama, but these weren't something I pursued until I was 19.","It isn't that easy to drop character, especially when you shoot for 12 to 16 hours a day for six months.","When you watch stuff that is YA, it looks like it's been made YA. It doesn't look real.","I had my first screen-acting class in March 2015, and I was, like, 18, turning 19, so it's a risk trying to get into acting when you're that 'old,' in inverted commas.","I think you always, with anything, need to have different viewpoints.","The first thing that I put in my apartment was a piano. I bought one for $50, and it was a lifesaver because I just went home and played and played... I'm sure I annoyed everyone on the same floor.","I don't have Twitter, but Lady Gaga tweeted at me - like, reposted an interview where I was fangirling - and wrote, 'Katherine' with a love heart. And I kind of freaked out a little bit.","It's not that Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter aren't really great mediums - let's be honest; technology allowing us to be able to contact people around the world is fantastic - but it's also so detrimental.","I just want to keep doing good projects with good people.","I love the opportunity to affect change in people's lives.","If I could time-travel, I would either go to the '70s and watch the first 'Star Wars' film the day it opened, or to 1880s London, during the Jack the Ripper era, and experience the true grossness of that time.","I love 'Star Trek: Voyager!'","I love sci-fi and period pieces - it's fantasy. I can let myself dream a little bit. But also, I just really love science. I love knowing about how the world works.","A lot of shows and movies that have tried to represent teenagers or the chaos that is coming at that age, they shy away from it, romanticize it, or they kind of fantasize what it's like to be a teenager.","When you're 16 and when you're 17, you're kind of walking that fine line of being an adult and legally being able to look out for yourself, while being able to look out for yourself and being treated as a child.","Things like putting around a list and having your name on a list that objectifies you, that's a big deal, and it can have big consequences."],"Katherine Mansfield":["If only one could tell true love from false love as one can tell mushrooms from toadstools.","Could we change our attitude, we should not only see life differently, but life itself would come to be different.","I love the rain. I want the feeling of it on my face.","I want, by understanding myself, to understand others. I want to be all that I am capable of becoming.","Would you not like to try all sorts of lives - one is so very small - but that is the satisfaction of writing - one can impersonate so many people.","Life never becomes a habit to me. It's always a marvel.","This is not a letter but my arms around you for a brief moment.","Make it a rule of life never to regret and never to look back. Regret is an appalling waste of energy, you can't build on it it's only good for wallowing in.","It's a terrible thing to be alone - yes it is - it is - but don't lower your mask until you have another mask prepared beneath - as terrible as you like - but a mask.","It is of immense importance to learn to laugh at ourselves.","Once we have learned to read, meaning of words can somehow register without consciousness.","The pleasure of all reading is doubled when one lives with another who shares the same books.","Looking back, I imagine I was always writing. Twaddle it was too. But better far write twaddle or anything, anything, than nothing at all.","Everything in life that we really accept undergoes a change.","I want to be all that I am capable of becoming.","Whenever I prepare for a journey I prepare as though for death. Should I never return, all is in order.","I always felt that the great high privilege, relief and comfort of friendship was that one had to explain nothing.","Some couples go over their budgets very carefully every month. Others just go over them.","Risk! Risk anything! Care no more for the opinions of others, for those voices. Do the hardest thing on earth for you. Act for yourself. Face the truth.","When we can begin to take our failures seriously, it means we are ceasing to be afraid of them. It is of immense importance to learn to laugh at ourselves.","What do you want most to do? That's what I have to keep asking myself, in the face of difficulties.","I'm a writer first and a woman after."],"Katherine McNamara":["Remember to reach for the stars, and they won't be able to resist flying into your hands!","Girl power to me means being brave enough to take that first step and to speak out and be yourself.","A lot of times on our show, 'Shadowhunters,' we have excuses to dawn some kind of sexy black leather attire under the excuse that we're going to fight demons, but it's all part of the tone of the piece and the tone of the story.","A woman can be demure, lady-like and the most prim and proper character, and still have a toughness and resiliency as apparent as a superhero-type female character or a warrior or soldier type. It's all about the story, the character, and the course of events in that piece of work and how that character is presented.","It's okay to have fear - we're all human; it happens - but in facing your fears, you can really open yourself up to things you never thought possible.","I have nothing against Dylan O'Brien! He's one of my favorite people. I have so much respect for him and his work.","My two best friends, they love amusement parks. They are such roller-coaster daredevils, and they drag me on every single roller coaster they can find. Some of my favorite experiences have been when they've taken me to Disneyland or Six Flags or Universal.","I see each project as an opportunity to grow as a person and as an actor.","I'm always going back to New York for Broadway workshops or reading. So I always keep my foot in the door: I'm always on the lookout for the next Broadway show.","Women are tough; women are resilient and have an undying hope.","I've always been a huge proponent for education; I graduated high school at 14 years old and graduated college at 17 years old.","I'll never stop acting, but music is another passion of mine. I just love creating projects in the entertainment field and performing onstage or in front of a camera.","I credit Kansas City with my work ethic and learning from the amazing artists that are in that town.","Girl Up gives girls an opportunity and gives them a platform and starting point through which they can take it and run with it and help give girls the opportunity to have the freedom, independence and the ability to get an education.","When you read something, it's a movie in your mind and such a personal experience. What we're trying to do is to bring a consensus version of that to life and make as many people happy as we can.","Women are tough, but sometimes women present toughness in different ways.","My grandfather used to be a dentist, and he made me these retainers that have vampire teeth on them.","Most of my work has been in L.A. or booked in L.A. and shot on location.","When I was little, I always wanted to grow up to be like Jessalyn Kincaid and Vanessa Severo. They showed me how much joy performing can give you.","I've had the opportunity to work on some really great indie features. One of them being 'Little Savages,' which is a super fun family film.","When I'm not on set, I'm in the studio.","Guys and girls can be friends without having to date!","In Bulgaria, they use the Cyrillic alphabet, which is completely different from ours. You can't sound the words out, so you can't read street signs or packages in the grocery store! You have to rely on pictures and guesses.","Up until I was about 12, I was a ballet dancer and a basketball player.","I'd love to do an action film. I'd love to do a film based on a book series; I love to read the book and then go see the movie. I'd love to have a show on Disney; I love working for them. And I'm also working on getting some new music out of my own.","I was a kid who would try anything, and I said, 'Sure, I'll try theater - sounds like fun.'","I remember walking onstage in the first performance, and something hit me like a brick wall, and I just knew at that moment that this is something I had to do for the rest of my life, and I've never looked back.","I feel so fortunate to have grown up in a town like Kansas City that has such a vibrant theater community."],"Katherine Moennig":["I went to this tattoo parlor in the East Village and I got an outline of a violin on my lower back. They call them tramp stamps now.","I went to an all-girls pre school where everyone went off to Harvard or Yale, and I had zero interest in doing so. I think they thought I was on drugs. There was a neighboring all-boys school, so we'd get together and do dumb things. It was your typical Catholic-American upbringing.","I like stories that are not normal, everyday lives. I don't personally seek them out, but they find me.","The characters I've played that people have noticed included a cross-dresser and a transsexual.","I'm not thrilled that I have a tramp stamp. When you see people bend over in their really low-cut jeans, I'm like, 'Oh... that's what I have.'","What I find very attractive, what I find sexual, are people who are unapologetic for who they are and comfortable with themselves. And I think with those two things sexual energy does come out because you're not hovering or censoring yourself, you're just being who you are. And being who you are is a very attractive quality in a person.","My best friend growing up really put the bug in my ear about acting. We created this one hour-and-a-half improv play when we were 10 or 11 and performed it at the library. We just played off each other so well and had the best time doing it and the funniest part was, we wound up having packed houses, other people loved it too.","My biggest challenge is trust, and really believing that trust, in letting things just happen personally and professionally and trust with myself. But I'm getting better at it.","I think my comparison with Shane would be a loner. I always got the impression that she wasn't scared to be alone. She enjoys it. I can relate to that.","Stage is about imperfections and working with them, whether it be from you or the audience.","In terms of 'Ray Donovan,' the story is so rich, the actors are so fantastic, the writing is impeccable. And it's such beautiful storytelling with complex characters.","I would not want to play a girl who masquerades as a boy for the rest of my life.","If you're androgynous, that's what you look like.","I wanted to be a violin-maker like my dad, and then I wanted to be a doorman in my building.","I have no hips, and I feel like my body's like a teenage boy's. But I can have the hair long, put on makeup, wear a dress, and do the exact opposite as well.","I don't fear commitment and people in my world getting too close.","You're always attracted to someone you want to learn from.","It's very interesting how life imitates art, and art imitates life; I find, whenever I read scenes of some magnitude, I'm like, 'Oh, I feel like I've experienced this,' or 'I am experiencing this,' or 'I might start to experience it soon.'","When someone gets closely related to a character they play on TV, it's very hard to break that mold and go on to do something else.","I expect that it won't be an easy road once 'The L Word' is over, but I'm gonna do everything in my power during my time off to do other things that show another side of me.","I was 100 percent tomboy. I had the biggest Big Wheels.","I come from a family of artists.","I'm here to play different characters.","I don't think I look like a boy, but I don't think androgyny is such a bad thing.","Let's call a spade a spade: when people look at me, they say, 'Oh, she's the androgynous one.' I'll tell you what type of character I would never be offered out there: The femme fatale. Or the white-trash, heterosexual hillbilly.","I've seen up close what can happen when actors talk publicly about their relationships: their personal life gets dismantled. It's a show business game, and it's one game I won't play.","I have to say a part of me was a little terrified to be only looked at as Shane from 'The L Word.' I was very conscious of doing something that would steer me clear or just steer me in a different direction.","God love the iPhone. Best time waster of the century.","Why do people care if I'm gay or not?"],"Katherine Parkinson":["I'm going to get myself one of those, um, movable computers - what do you call them... ? Laptops! I am bad. I still call my radio a wireless.","People don't realise what a nice thing it is for an actor to go to a job where they know or like everybody, because you're so often having to do new beginnings, starting off on set with people you don't know, having to introduce yourself and make friends.","I've become one of those women who thrusts her engagement finger out all the time.","I did a lot of serious plays, and I did the Oxford Review as well, which is supposed to be funny, but I'm not sure how funny we were when we did it. Then, when I finished my course, it was only then that I decided to go to drama school and try and do acting because I was enjoying it so much and so on.","Because I'd done 30 plays or so at Oxford, I thought that I was an actress anyway because that's what I was doing!","There are a few people who genuinely see the best in everyone.","I admire any woman who does stand-up, but frankly I'd rather pull out my own eyelids.","You do develop a taste as an actress: Chekhov, Ayckbourn: it's the combination of comedy and human drama. I would never want to do anything without comedy.","Acting is about enhancing your life, not representing something that's missing.","Carol Burnett, who played Miss Hannigan in 'Annie', is as funny as it gets.","'Family Guy' is relentlessly excellent.","When I was at school studying biology, I wanted to be a medical researcher. I did work experience at St Mary's Hospital in London, and I begged them to let me see the post mortems. So the first time I saw a naked male was at 15, when I saw an 89 year old man who had died of a brain hemorrhage."],"Katherine Paterson":["I guess real maturity, which most of us never achieve, is when you realize that you're not the center of the universe.","If you're a kid who is always on the outside hoping to be on the inside, you're watching a lot. You're trying to figure out how to become a normal person in a society that considers you weird.","I know a movie and a book are two different things and you are going do different media in different ways. No author can want a movie to be exactly like the book because then it will be a bad movie.","I'm a great believer in research. I have to know about a place before I write a story that is set in that place.","A story is open-ended. A story invites you into it to make your own meaning.","I think if a book has the power to move a reader, it also has the power to offend a reader. And you want your books to have power, so you just have to take what comes with that.","The best thing about being a writer is it gives you readers who understand your deepest feelings and fears.","It is always sad to write about prejudice, but sometimes when we see it being played out in the lives of fictional characters, we can recognize it in our own lives.","Obviously, I love to do both contemporary and historical fiction. When a hint of a story grabs me, I try to go with it to see where it will take me whatever the setting.","I love to read. But I loved to read a lot longer than I started to love writing.","I like to write about a lot of things, which is why my books are different. This is probably why I don't like to write sequels, but chiefly I like to write about people.","I love writing for young adults because they are such a wonderful audience, they are good readers, and they care about the books they read.","Reading asks that you bring your whole life experience and your ability to decode the written word and your creative imagination to the page and be a co-author with the writer, because the story is just squiggles on the page unless you have a reader.","All of us use art and literature as an escape from time to time, but if it's any good, it has a healing quality - a quality that enlarges our human spirits.","Death is very mysterious to us. One moment someone is there with us, and the next moment they're not.","The problem with people who are afraid of imagination, of fantasy, is that their world becomes so narrow that I don't see how they can imagine beyond what their senses can verify. We know from science that there are entire worlds that our senses can't verify.","Kids often ask me if characters are real or made up - and I always tell them, 'I hope they're real but I made them up.'","Children have to have access to books, and a lot of children can't go to a store and buy a book. We need not only our public libraries to be funded properly and staffed properly, but our school libraries. Many children can't get to a public library, and the only library they have is a school library.","If you're so afraid of your imagination that you stifle it, how are you going to know God? How can you imagine heaven?","We do have trouble dealing with death, but it's the one thing that is guaranteed we are all going to have to do, and we are going to have to face it many times before we die ourselves.","It's such a thrill when an adult comes up to me and says, 'I read your book as a child and really loved it.' That's a tremendous compliment.","I'd like for the young people, and older ones, too, who don't count themselves as readers, to know the joy of reading and what it does to enrich your life in so many ways.","I can't believe there will ever be a time when the book is truly obsolete. It is the perfect technology and feeds the soul.","Some say it is the elements of hope and wonder in children's books that make them special. But there are many dark young adult novels these days. Adults loved Harry Potter, though it was written for the young. In the end, it is probably up to the reader of any age to decide if this book is for him or her."],"Katherine Ryan":["I am an undisputed gangster. To me, that means playing by my own rules.","We don't have 'posh' in Canada. It's just not a thing that exists.","Stand-up comedy is not a man's job. It's an alpha job: To be the only person in a room with a microphone who's allowed to talk.","When you stand out in a small town or at work,or in your peer group, whatever it is, it feels really awful. Certainly, when you're growing up, you want to be normal. You just want to fit in. Then you realize that maybe fitting in is, in some respects, quite ordinary. I think it's good to put a positive spin on being slightly unique.","Growing up in Canada, I dated a few ice hockey players.","Our attention spans have been reduced by the immediate gratification provided by smartphones and social media.","I'm a flirt by nature, and I like flirting with that line of what's passable and what's not, and I genuinely don't believe that I cross it.","I have little time for sincerity.","Skiing is ridiculous.","I'm nearly see-through. Like a jellyfish.","I talk funny 'cause I come from Canada.","The Kardashian family have earned their place as an American dynasty.","Anything that I'm passionate about and surprises me usually ends up turning into a joke simply because I have questions about it and I'm curious and I want to talk about it.","Isolated incidents have lateral, lasting implications.","My life is so much better with lupus because I know that stress and too much junk food will literally put me in hospital.","All I've ever wanted to be is a strong, powerful, beautiful black woman.","When I talk about celebrities, it's not a dismantling of that human being.","I love Lena Dunham. I love, love, love her.","Alice Levine has great unique style and beautiful red hair.","I had white hair when I was 19. I think bleach can be addictive, and before long, you've gone too far with it and can't tell you've got a problem. It was over-processed and genuinely crispy, but I thought I looked amazing.","If I've got a confidence problem, it's that my self-esteem is entirely too high.","The more you mess with texture and colour, the worse your hair is going to feel.","I'm actually thrilled with the woman I'm turning out to be.","Part of me has always wanted to be like Marilyn Monroe or any Fifties Hollywood starlet. On screen, they seemed so sexy and simple and looked after. In real life, I'm none of those things. But I'd rather be fierce and complicated.","When you're little, every experience writes on the canvas of who you are.","Racism is what acquitted O. J. Simpson.","I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to look and feel like a grown woman when I was young. That's one reason why it's important to hold adults who take advantage of that fully accountable.","I love Little Mix, and I always have.","You think Trump cares if you leave? He wants power, not prosperity.","Why would you watch an Oscar-nominated film unless you're mad enough to purposely experience feelings? Bleh. I'm not interested in catching those.","I don't think I spoke to anyone apart from my daughter for the first two years of her life.","I have huge admiration for Taylor Swift. She's tall, talented, young, thin, and beautiful. More importantly, she seems focused, generous, vulnerable, and kind.","It's not my place to tell anyone what kind of feminist she should be.","I guess I talk about her because I'm interested; I'm listening. Taylor Swift's words are so valuable to so many young people, not just her #GirlSquad.","If you really want to wind up Piers Morgan, send him a pic of Jeremy Clarkson.","How are people still working with Terry Richardson?","Society wants happy families.","Posh people blow my mind. Apart from empathy, they're good at everything - true survivalists.","Regressing back to an infant state is nothing to be proud of. Rich Americans don't drive themselves, don't cook, don't do their own nails/hair/make-up, don't shop, and I suppose all they've got in common with rich British people is that they don't raise their own kids, either.","Many of us are quite stupid.","Jeremy Corbyn confuses the public because he looks like a librarian and enjoys baking bread.","I am behind Kanye West for American President 100 per cent.","The holidays are the worst time to travel, and ISIS aren't making things any easier.","If you're struggling for gift ideas, my advice is to give experiences rather than things.","I think commitment is inextricably linked with success, and rightly or wrongly, people with a fierce commitment to their goals - the Kanyes of this world - are really entertaining.","The representation of women in hip-hop has long been so flagrantly unkind.","I highly recommend reading the book 'Confessions Of A Video Vixen.'","I love paying people to touch me. Nail techs, hair stylists, dermatologists, make-up artists, osteopaths: you name it, I love it.","Christmas coming means one thing for comedians: office party gigs!","I'm not interested in younger men for the same reason most women aren't interested in younger men; I don't have time to make an extra packed lunch every morning. Please. I'm busy enough already.","I've decided that I'm completely rock n' roll.","Question everything.","I know a lot about systemic lupus erythematosus because I have it, too. I was diagnosed through the NHS when I first moved to England in 2008 following months of serious illness.","I don't worry about whether or not people like me.","I love Britain. I'm an Irish citizen, but I was born in Canada, and I'm a British comedian, really. My entire career has been over here.","One of my favourite things about living in the U.K. is having that chance to go to festivals.","We don't have glamour models in Canada at all.","I feel like my comedy voice is to take the news and everything that's happening and put a funny spin on it or to pick out the things I find funny about it.","I thank God every day that there was no YouTube or Twitter when I was a teenager. I would have had a channel, and it would have been mortifying.","When I talk about celebrities, I don't dislike them - it's what they represent.","I'm from that generation where there aren't that many pictures of me as a baby.","Justin Bieber is a lovely chap.","When you're really famous, there's very little authenticity in people, so you prefer the company of children.","In Canada, good waitresses are tipped well. I learnt that the harder you work, the more money you make.","I was certainly not a class clown; I confused and angered a lot of people with my sense of humor.","I really loved making my mom laugh, and I knew that she thought that I was funny. It was really valuable, in my home growing up, to be able to have a chat and participate in a conversation and be funny. Whatever I could do to make my mom laugh could either get me out of trouble or just get me more attention or get me respect in the house.","I started doing little amateur nights at the comedy club that was right next to the restaurant that I waitressed in when I was in university. I was probably 22 years old. I didn't do it with any intention of making a career out of it; I had just always valued comedy.","I was really lucky to have been raised in this really powerful matriarchy where my dad was around, but I was with my mom and my grandma most of the time. They were heavy influences on me. My mother has a career in technology; my grandma sold real estate.","I wasn't properly performing in Canada. I was just starting out, and when everyone starts out, they're terrible. I'm sure there are some Kellyanne Conway videos of me just really dying on a stage.","I was lucky to develop in the U.K. because I find comedy - in addition to being caustic - it's quite literary over here, and alternative comedy isn't so alternative.","I feel like I'm always on the right side of wrong and trying to shout out for the underdog.","People who like my stuff and know what my agenda is have never mistaken me for being racist or poking fun at the wrong thing.","I always tried to fit in, so I was a cheerleader with the orange skin and white-blonde hair, and Hooters was part of that.","In Canada, we just have rich and poor, but we don't constantly remind poor people about it.","I'm a single mother. It's silly to turn down work.","I have a really different touring life to most comedians because I go home every night to do the school run in the morning. So I'm not in hotels or living it up.","I was seen as a little weirdo. But I was certain I wasn't a weirdo. I knew who the weirdos were, and it wasn't me!","I was born with the confidence of an 89-year-old man. So it's strange when people ask, 'What's it like being a female comedian?' It never occurred to me that I'd be limited as a woman - that I couldn't be a scientist, a doctor, or anything I wanted.","I was a product of the society that said women are for decoration, and I do think girls should be able to do whatever they want.","I'd never say something that I didn't feel I could defend.","I'm very careful not to tell a joke just to get a reaction.","The beautiful thing about comedy in the U.K. is that it has a clever twist to it, and when you really break it down, the joke isn't filthy at all: it's clever.","I got into comedy at exactly the right moment.","I'm proud to be Canadian. But I identify as being a British mum.","If I ever move back to Canada, it'll be because I'm terminally ill.","I think it's better, if people aren't getting on, that they should divorce.","When I think about women of color and their place politically in the world and culture... they've had two layers of just garbage to overcome. To me, a black woman is a woman-woman.","I'm not a Rachel Dolezal. I don't fake tan; I don't have the cornrows, I don't misappropriate. I just want to be Beyonce.","My mother was a businesswoman; my grandmother was a businesswoman - it never occurred to me that life might be harder because you're a woman. It wasn't until later and I had a bigger sense of the world that I realised that.","I didn't really realise that I was going to have more obstacles because I was a woman. It was never something that I thought about.","If I'm in the position where I get to hire someone, where I get to decide who joins me on tour, then I am mindful about that, and I try to suggest women that I know who I think deserve more exposure.","You'll never make a success of yourself when you're doing an impersonation of somebody else.","Growing up, I loved comedy even before I knew that you could be a stand-up comedian.","I wanted to be liked when I was younger, which I think a lot of us do; I'm not ashamed to say it. I was a product of my environment, a product of my culture.","My dad's Irish, so I was visiting Ireland a lot as a kid, so it's not totally foreign to me.","I don't know that I'd be a comedian if I stayed in Canada.","I've always been attracted to comedy that was really close to the line and made people a little uncomfortable, because that's where progress comes from.","I'm not a nasty person."],"Katherine Schwarzenegger":["Learning to love my inner and outer beauty wasn't an easy road. I still don't always love the reflection I see in the mirror, but I have learned that my outer appearance does not define me.","We should celebrate how amazing our bodies are! We all have things that we like and dislike about our bodies, but we need to focus on what we love - maybe it's a great smile, strong legs or curly hair?","As young women, we all feel a pressure to look a certain way, and sometimes it is just too much to handle. But, there are good and bad ways to deal with this pressure. A terrible way to handle this pressure is to complain about all of our flaws and expect other girls to join in.","Shopping is a great way to bond with the girls, but it definitely makes us focus on our bodies and compare ourselves to others. Something that should be a fun outing with the girls can turn into an uncomfortable experience.","I did an internship with Dove when they were doing the 'real beauty' campaign, and I was really inspired by that. Growing up in L.A., being a young woman, and seeing how the media tells young women to be everything you're not, I kind of wrote about that experience.","My father is Arnold Schwarzenegger, the governor of California, and yes, he was the Terminator! He is also a former Mr. Universe and Mr. Olympia, two titles he earned as a champion bodybuilder.","Looking back, I can genuinely say that I am truly grateful that my parents sheltered us from the public eye. This may sound like an easy task, but it was probably the hardest thing they had to figure out as parents - how to give their kids a normal childhood even though they were always in the spotlight.","When I was younger, I played sports and went to camp. As I got older, my parents began to instill in us the importance of giving back to the community, especially those places around the world that are less fortunate than my very privileged life growing up in Los Angeles.","Most people feel weird about white heels, but I love them and wear them with everything, especially when I need to mix up an all-black outfit.","My go-to shoes for everyday would probably have to be either my white Converse that I've had since high school or my black Alexander McQueen flats with the skull on the top. It depends on my day.","My go-to shoes for red-carpet events are usually always black, but I mix between my pointed stilettos and platform heels.","I decided to move out of the apartment I was sharing with my best friend before graduation and move back home. My parents had recently separated, and I wanted to move back home with my mom and my siblings.","I'm so excited to be working with 360, not only because I am in love with everything they create but also because each collection always includes the key pieces I look for.","I like clothes that are fashionable but also have great messages for lifestyle, and 360 does just that - the sweaters are for women of all shapes and sizes and are designed to allow a woman to feel beautiful and chic from the inside out.","I graduated high school, and I did my internship at Dove in their public relations department because I thought I wanted to be in PR, which turns out I did not. It was right when they were coming out with the Campaign for Real Beauty, so I got an inside view on the whole thing.","My siblings and I were raised to be very hardworking and to find something that we're passionate in, and to be able to turn that into work - I'm lucky to be able to say that I've done that.","I love traveling around and talking to women in groups like the Girl Scouts, and being able to work with them is such an honor. For me, it's always about working really hard and being able to help other people, which is what I've done with both of my books.","I'm really passionate and love everything lifestyle-oriented, so that's what I do on my website. I have been able to get other people to contribute to the website to create kind of a hub for people in the millennial generation - people my age.","I talk to my mom about six times a day, and we constantly email in between that. People say that I'm her twin. I guess it would be the Kennedy genes; my cheekbones are coming out.","I've always been way closer to my mom. I'm close to my dad, but they're totally different kinds of relationships.","The whole thing with contouring is to contour where your natural cheekbone would be and where sun would hit you naturally.","Of all the reader questions I get each week, the most common question I get is, 'What are you wearing?'","An example of a trend that I tried that didn't exactly work out would be high-waisted jeans. We see them everywhere, but what I realized is that they don't work for every body type.","I don't do my hair very perfectly because I think it looks sexier when you don't have everything perfectly structured out.","It's easy to be critical of ourselves and other women around us. We stand in front of the mirror and only focus on the things we hate about our body and our appearance. But I encourage you to change that attitude the next time you are in front of the mirror.","Keep in mind that it is very important to stay moving and to get exercise - positive feelings about our appearance develop once we start taking control of our health.","I was never into makeup when I was younger, and I still love not piling on the makeup every day, but as I've gotten older I've actually found makeup to be fun.","Women's bodies are meant to store fat so that we can do amazing things like have babies or rock a tight pair of jeans.","When I went to college, I met a new group of friends and looked back on my high-school experience and realized how much time I had wasted on trying to make myself something I wasn't.","I'm aware of the fact that I don't know how to do it all, but I want for my blog to be a place where people can come to ask questions so that I can look for the answers for them. That's the kind of work that I did for my books, and I want to transition that to my blog for more of a community feel.","The most important thing that I've learnt is that the perfect body doesn't exist.","From the moment I watched my first episode of 'Girls,' I have been a fan of Lena Dunham.","I grew up with my mom always talking to everyone everywhere, whether it was professionally or in a coffee shop. And my dad was the same way. So I love being able to talk to people, hear their stories and be inspired."],"Katherine Waterston":["I think connecting to a character is like connecting to any human being - either you like them or you don't. You might not be able to list the reasons why you love your best friend or what attracted you to them; it's just something that you feel - a connection, an understanding, or a curiosity that makes you want to get to know them.","I love that feeling. I guess I love escaping my life, really. I love going into another world and feeling for this amount of time that this is it, this is the world I'm going to live in. You feel it more during the rehearsal process.","I find life so shocking in general. Everything about it surprises me.","Sometimes we'll walk into a set, and I'll think, 'Oh, this film doesn't look like this.' You know, 'cause I read the script, and I saw it in my head in some other way. Which is a lot like what happens when they're writing a movie that's based on a book - I'm like, 'Ah! He doesn't have a beard.' You have these visions in your head about it.","I didn't feel a specific pressure to prove myself because I had an actor in the family. I didn't feel that pressure to fill some big shoes or anything.","Costume design is so important and really helpful, and I really love that aspect of character development, just figuring it out.","For 'Beasts,' I really wanted my character to be this sort of mushy, muscleless Muppet.","If you have a famous parent, you know that being famous doesn't make you superior to anyone else. It just means people smile at you more. Everyone was fawning all over my father, but of course, the way you look at your parents when you're a teen is often with a... more critical eye.","Every now and then, you get lucky enough to work with some people you feel like you would take a bullet for.","My first memory of the Harry Potter series was my little brother just falling into those books and not resurfacing until he was done. That J.K. Rowling got an entire generation reading is extraordinary - I'm amazed, thrilled, and proud to now be portraying one of that phenomenal writer's characters.","I wonder sometimes if I've got in the habit of only being courageous when someone else has written the words I have to say.","The best way to honor real people when you play them is to try to tell the story of their dynamics and the struggles that they're dealing with rather than lose sight of the connections and personal relationships, and do a really good job at an accent.","I think it's a luxury when you love the thing you're promoting, and then you don't have to try to think of something, try and find some angle.","I've always wanted to play the villain. But the young girl is never the villain.","There's something particular about the way Los Angeles feels in the summertime. It slows down and is hazy and dreamy, and you can put on certain music and go for a drive and be totally sober but feel stoned.","Self-promotion is not my strong suit, for sure. I don't look down on it; I just don't understand how to do it.","I don't think Paul Thomas Anderson has a standard approach to anything.","I didn't find it difficult to live in the 'Inherent Vice' world or play those scenes, because they just seemed so real.","I look back at my adolescence, and I'm shocked at the things I did that were my idea of adult behavior.","I thought acting was what grownups did. It was such a part of my childhood. I was already in love with performing before I knew there were other options. By then, it was too late.","When I got to NYU, I immediately inquired about doing a double major in acting and photography.","I feel like people assume if a character is very different than you, that means it's difficult to get into their head or into their skin.","I was barely in 'Taking Woodstock.'","I feel like most actors just dig and dig and work and work in whatever way they do to try to do as much as they can to portray a character in the limited time they have to play it, whether it's six months or one month or one week of work, you know.","I don't like to talk about things unless I have to. I don't like to talk a scene to death or overanalyze it, especially if I feel like I have some way in on my own.","Seeing someone happy on set is just a very small slice of the reality of an actor's life.","When you come from a family of actors, people in show business, they really know to celebrate good news and to celebrate it hard because it's not every day that you get it.","I think everything happens organically. You mine for clues. It's all immersive, and stuff you can use comes out of that immersion. I don't really like to wear wigs in movies because I like to look like the character all the time.","I guess whatever the director's energy is is kind of contagious on set, because, um, you know, it's a hierarchy, and we're all kind of looking to the director for guidance.","I basically never believed that I was a commercial actor. Just because of the outcome of many auditions over time. No one hired me.","It's very easy to think that the way things are is the way things will stay, and life just isn't like that.","I think that when you are struggling as an actor, you imagine that if things were to pan out, everything in your life would change, But really, it's not so different. You're still pursuing good work. You still panic that you're doing it all wrong.","Actors are sensitive freaks, but it amazes me that it is something that I haven't improved on over the years.","There's kind of no rhyme or reason to what is appealing to any given actor. It just is, or it isn't. It's kind of like dating. You either connect to someone or you don't. You can't really say why.","There are people who have really high expectations for what we're doing. I have to not think about that so that I can be free and play around every day and not feel like I have to get it right. You want to be loose.","Usually on films, you get used to kind of being told, 'This is what you're going to wear, this is what you're going to hold, and remember, you're lucky to be here, and shut up.'","'Inherent Vice' was a novel that already existed, and in 'Steve Jobs,' I was playing a real person; in those situations, you do feel an added pressure to please.","Some days, the first coffee just laughs at you. It says, 'Oh, you think I'm going to wake you up? Sucker.'","I think I really would have quit if I hadn't gotten 'Inherent Vice'. Or maybe I would have just shriveled up and died.","People think the advantage of a parent in the business is that they'll open doors for you. But the true advantage for me is having someone who knows exactly what you're going through.","About 10 minutes before I found out that I had landed 'Fantastic Beasts', I got a residual check in the mail for zero dollars. On the check it said 'Advice Slip.' And I was like, 'Well, what's the advice? Go into another line of work?","Acting is a community where you come in and out of each other's lives. I'm slightly envious of the Golden Age of Hollywood. It must have been frustrating to be owned by the studio, but it was also like being in a company, working with the same people, and that appeals to me.","We live in such hypersexualised yet totally prudish times. People have this expectation about everyone else's relationship to their own bodies.'Surely you must have shame about your body? Surely what's scariest for you as actor would be to stand in a room naked?' Believe me, I've been in so many more terrifying situations as a performer than that.","That period between finishing the film and opening night is agonising. That's part of why actors go from job to job - so they don't have to live with the anxiety in the interim.","Shower scenes are great. Janet Leigh never took a shower again in her life after 'Psycho'.","Sometimes you find yourself digging around for something useful, and you don't necessarily know what it is until you find it. Sometimes it's a word from a book that you read every day.","Obviously, as an actor, you have to embrace your imagination all the time, but when you're doing one of these films, you have to embrace your most childlike imagination - a sense of wonder and uninhibited playfulness.","When I go to see a movie, I never think about all the people it took to make it.","When 'The Master' came around, they said they wanted to try and find a part for me, and I got a text from the casting director saying that.","I have been a scrappy actor for 10-plus years, and when you're playing supporting roles, your relationship with the costume designer is very different.","When you're playing Marilyn Monroe, you have a responsibility to look and sound like her that you don't when you're playing people who weren't ever in the public eye.","One of my earliest memories was when I was three, going to this full-length mirror in my parents' bathroom and saying into the mirror, 'You are going to be an actress.'","When you are the kid of an actor, it's always a very inviting world. Everyone is nice to you, the hair and make-up people braid your hair and play with you, and the costume department makes outfits for your teddy bears.","I really love fashion, but I feel like the older I get, the more I am drawn to the basic things in my daily life because everything else is so goofy and crazy.","I've always enjoyed disappearing into a crowd in New York. As an actor, I love to spy, and it's hard to be a good spy if everyone is looking at you. Also, I'm pretty shy. I don't really like a lot of attention.","All acting is nudity. It's all vulnerable - and a little bit scary.","What appeals about the '70s is the celebration of the female form, the lack of constriction.","I was devastated when they stopped making sailors' pants with bell bottoms. There's something sort of spirited about the way they affected a man's gait. They project something good-natured.","I feel a kind of permission and freedom in my work that I might not allow myself in my real life.","I think it's quite common for actors to almost rely on their characters to exercise parts of themselves in their regular life they don't tend to explore so much.","I'm constantly struggling in interviews to engage and finish sentences, because I am being asked personal questions from somebody I don't know.","Being interviewed is an odd experience for me because I was an actor a long time before anyone ever asked me a question about myself. When I started being interviewed, I definitely felt I was being asked to defend or explain myself.","I feel that nudity is sort of what we do as actors.","I don't have shame with my body. I don't find a breast more vulnerable than an elbow.","I generally don't like to talk too much about the character unless I feel stuck or in some trouble.","What's comforting about coming from a family of actors is I don't have to explain the struggle. I can just sigh to my sister, 'I had a bad one,' and she'll know exactly the profound audition humiliation I am describing.","The minute you get cast, you worry they've made the most terrible mistake. There's a really awkward stage between being hired and doing the job when it doesn't feel real.","The only way my mother's beauty really affected me was that I always assumed that someday I would look like her. Then, late in my teens, I looked at a photo of her when she was younger than I was then, and I realised, no, it's never going to happen.","I think there's an assumption when you have a parent in the business that you're given some kind of a cheat sheet at an early age. Some kind of upper hand or some kind of advanced understanding of how the whole thing functions - maybe how to operate within it. I never felt I received that cheat sheet and grew up pretty removed from the business.","Sometimes you meet people, and you somehow feel like you've known them your whole life.","You kind of wake up in the morning, and you don't see anybody but these actors until you go home at night and pass out and do it again. So it's structured a lot like the process when you're making a film. You just kind of get in that tunnel vision. I like that. I like when the rest of the world kind of quiets.","It's just a dream of the struggling actor to just have a proper shot - not just in a film that people will see, but with a character that's rich and complicated and that you can show you're capable of taking on.","I'm overly sentimental and don't throw things away.","I love connecting with a character out of the blue, not knowing why.","Can't remember a time when I didn't want to be an actor... though it felt like something I couldn't do until I grew up. I mean, I knew kids could be actors - I recall seeing them on my dad's shoots and getting jealous.","The things I love about this business the most, is that it is a challenge trying to prove to everyone - including yourself - that you can do something different than what people think you're capable of."],"Katherine Webb":["Pageant makeup is so different from your day-to-day look. When you're on stage you really have to pack it on.","Every single model wants to be in 'Sports Illustrated,' and I feel extremely blessed to have that opportunity.","I'm from Alabama and I have morals and I have class. That's my personality.","I've done modeling since I was 18, but it didn't take off until I moved to Los Angeles. Modeling has always been something I've been really good at, and has been something that's helped pay bills.","A lot of people have said I'm the anti-Kim Kardashian and I'm all right with that.","As you know, the South is known for its hospitality, traditions, football, pageants, and food. Football is almost like a religion here. People say their priorities are faith, family, and then football. People eat, breathe, and sleep it in the South. It's a huge deal.","I've never really been the type to dress up like the other girls do. I'm more of a casual, relaxed kind of girl. More athletic.","I was always the tallest girl in my class, and it made me have really bad posture because I wanted to seem shorter than I really was. It really reflected how I felt about myself. I spent most of my youth in school feeling really insecure about the way I looked because I was different.","Modeling and pageants help me overcome feeling insecure about the way that I look and my height.","I just try to stick to clean foods, anything grilled like salmon, chicken, fish, brown rice, and veggies. I do have a really big sweet tooth, so I try to curb my cravings with fruit instead.","I've gotten used to using individual lashes as well. A lot of girls will use strip eyelashes, but the glue comes out of each side and it gets messy. Individual lashes make your eyes look bigger and much more natural.","You have to be 100 percent comfortable with yourself and who you are. You'll have unflattering pictures posted on the Internet for all to see, so you have to be able to handle yourself and stay true to yourself.","The majority of my family is Auburn fans, and I grew up watching Auburn football, and that's always who I've cheered for.","Of course, I love football, but I'm not one of those die-hard fans that never miss a game or with rooms devoted to team colors. At the end of the day, it's just a game.","In pageants, you are evaluated from head to toe and it's obviously all about looks, and as vain as that is, they can also bring you lots of opportunities to do amazing things."],"Katheryn Winnick":["I'm a 3rd degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do and 2nd degree in karate, and I'm a licensed bodyguard.","I grew up being a bit of a tomboy, a big-time tomboy.","I started training in martial arts when I was 7 years old. I got my first black belt at 13.","I started my own martial arts school at 16. And by the time I was 21, I had three different schools.","I grew up in a martial arts gym surrounded by men and boys, and I pretty much call myself a tomboy.","The Norse way of speaking, no one really knew what the Vikings sounded liked, they were Norsemen. The accent is really a combination of a Scandinavian accent, maybe with a Swedish accent and an old way of speaking.","My first car was a Chevy Cavalier. My dad somehow convinced me that it was a hot sports car because it was red.","When I was growing up, there were times I had to compete against boys in tae kwon do, and I'd show them right away that I wasn't someone to mess with."],"Kathi Appelt":["An entire nation, it seemed, was standing in one long breadline, desperate for even the barest essentials. It was a crisis of monumental proportions. It was known as the Great Depression.","Many of the original New Deal programs required heavy manual labor. WPA workers built hundreds of schools, health clinics, roads, park facilities, and community centers. Much of what we now call our 'infrastructure' - highways, buildings, power plants, etc. - is here thanks to thousands of WPA workers.","They were the darkest of times, the years following the crash of the stock market in 1929. Thousands of people across the United States were cast out of their Jobs, off their farms, out of their homes and apartments, and into the crushing depths of poverty.","The moments that I feel the most imbued with a sense of awe are always the moments when I am outdoors. I can't help but feel a certain sense of wonder - I become almost filled with it.","President Franklin D. Roosevelt had to find a way to help the American people. In 1933, he created a relief program known as the New Deal. Two years later, he expanded the New Deal by adding the Works Progress Administration, which was renamed the Work Projects Administration in 1939.","I always wanted to write a raccoon story. I don't know why. It's not like I want to own a raccoon or anything like that. I'm just fascinated by them.","There is nothing lonelier than a cat who has been loved, at least for a while, and then abandoned on the side of the road.","My favorite was the one about 'Snow White'. Those funky little guys with the beards. The poisonous apple. And that cool mirror the evil stepmother used to talk to. You know, she'd ask it all these questions: Who's the nicest? Who's the sweetest... Who's the fairest of them all? And for a while, everything was hunky-dory.","On the craft level, writing for children is not so different from writing for adults. You still have to have a story that moves forward. You still have to have the tools of the trade down. The difference arises in the knowledge of who you're writing for. This isn't necessary true of writing for adults.","Telling stories and having them received is so important. That dialogue is everything. I tell my students all the time that what separates us as human beings is our ability to hold stories. Our narrative history. There is so much power in that. Storytelling is our human industry.","We underestimate children and the people who work with them. I swear - so often, I tell people I am a children's author, and it's like they want to pat me on the head: 'Aw, isn't that sweet.'","I have always been interested in abandoned cars. I can't tell you how many times I've been in a car, driving, and there's a car sitting in a pasture, totally abandoned. Or on the edge of a creek or something. I always wonder: why did somebody park it in the pasture and leave?","I had tried writing novels for many years, and they always escaped me. For a long time, I thought, 'It's just not in me to write a novel. It's not something I'm able to do.' It seemed like everything I wrote naturally ended at the bottom of page three. A picture book, three pages; an essay, three pages.","I'm fully conscious of the fact that I wouldn't be the writer that I am without this place, without Vermont College.","Obsidian was caused by volcanoes, an eruption of steam and gas so furious that it melted the earth itself into this hard, shiny object.","For cats, a hound is a natural enemy. This is the order of things.","Magic happens, see. It's just like on those bumper stickers, the ones that say, 'Miracles Happen', or 'Jesus Happens'. I never really took those too seriously. I mean, they're bumper stickers. Yeah, yeah, I know what you're thinking. Miracles? Right. Jesus? Maybe. But magic?","One afternoon, I was playing this new video game, 'Blood and Guts.' I was controlling Gruesome Gus versus the Crimson Menace, and I had totally waxed the guy. It was this really complex sequence of moves, and I was so excited about conquering the game that I wanted to show it to someone. Unfortunately, the only one home at the time was Mom.","At any given time, all of us have an empty spot: one that is calling for companionship, for example, or for justice, love, romance, or a belly laugh. When I sit down to write, I look to see what hole needs filling at that particular moment.","Flat or uninteresting writing often signals something deeper that is being covered up."],"Kathie Lee Gifford":["Love in the real world means saying you're sorry 10 times a day.","A fear of the unknown keeps a lot of people from leaving bad situations.","Sexual harassment is complex, subtle, and highly subjective.","Why do I pray? Because I never know what's going to pop out of my mouth.","We're imperfect people trapped in an imperfect world until we get to that place beyond.","Other kids did drugs; I did crafts. I never knew where I fit in.","Mom thinks I live in this dream world where everybody's Ivana Trump.","I once said the Queen of England could use some fashion advice.","It's no secret that I love to talk, but the real secret is I love to listen, too.","For every sleazeball in the business there are plenty of decent and wonderful people.","For many people religion can be so easy they stumble right over it.","God didn't bless me with success so I could eat caviar every day.","I did feel from day one that I was a born performer.","I don't think Lloyd's of London would insure this mouth.","I felt no stigma whatsoever in becoming the third Mrs. Gifford.","I hate politics, hate deals, and deal-making, hate meeting with attorneys and agents.","I sang with Anita Bryant in the Southern Baptist churches.","I was told all my life I was part Cherokee. Then it was Crow. The latest is Blackfoot.","I wasn't ever interested in marrying someone else's career or bank account.","I would never want to hurt anyone by writing a book.","If I could learn to treat triumph and disaster the same, then I would find bliss.","If I'm in love I want to get married. That's how stupid I am.","Life seemed so simple and joyous when I was growing up.","Our culture is in moral chaos. On TV we celebrate freaks instead of honest, decent people.","Over the years my mom has become a self-taught Biblical scholar.","People were referring to me as the new Anita Bryant. Anita would get a little jealous.","The payoffs in showbiz seemed as random as a slot machine.","There was no way we'd ever get spoiled. Daddy made sure to instill in us a work ethic.","There were no bigger stars in the new evangelism than the Bakkers.","They don't call me spontaneous and irreverant for nothing.","To me an audition is 30 crazed people in a room waiting to be axed.","To this day I do not believe I'm great at anything.","We heard stories about fakery and decoys at revivals. I never personally saw any trickery.","When I was almost 13 I was ripe for religion. I was actually just plain ripe."],"Kathleen Battle":["The question is not... if art is enough to fulfill my life, but if I am true to the path I have set for myself, if I am the best I can be in the things I do. Am I living up to the reasons I became a singer in the first place?","I sing what I sing. And that's recitals and orchestra concerts. To appease - no, that's not the right word - let's say to satisfy - any opera urgings that my public has, I'll put in an aria.","Wynton and Christopher were really great experiences for me because they are both very gifted artists.","Wherever and whenever I sing, if there is only one spiritual on a program, people will talk about two things afterward, and one of them will be the spiritual. What I bring to this is the best of my classical training - not all of it. I apply what is appropriate.","In spirituals, the talk of heaven and deliverance was code for a better life. 'Crossing the River Jordan' was code, of course, for escaping to freedom.","I can't imagine life without singing.","New York is a great place to be fed in the arts. The arts in general are a large part of my life. The city was my postgraduate course.","I hear music that comes out of need, out of grief, sorrow, suffering and out of overcoming these things, as well. That journey to freedom still goes on today. It's an incremental change, the culmination of many events in your own life and the lives of your children and grandchildren.","How many of the original songs survive intact from the slave cabins? Probably not many in their original form. Time has transformed them like light in a prism. What we hope to present is a version of those spirituals, and they speak not just to black Americans, but to people worldwide.","I bring my classical training - some of it, but not all of it - and also my background and culture, to spirituals. And I try to leave room for that unpredictable factor, where the feeling of the song is allowed to come through. The same ethos can be applied to singing Mozart, or Schubert, or Bach. It's not just about what's on the page.","Some of the music I listen to is pop. I sing it in the shower - and then for public consumption.","When I do concerts and recitals, the two most common requests are spirituals and opera.","Some of the things that have been the most meaningful to me have been experiences I've shared with my family.","I think for more than half of my career, I have refrained from talking to the media.","I'm a consumer as well as a performer. Among my leisure-time activities is going to the theater. I'm very interested in that.","People are drawn to the spiritual. It has a universal appeal.","From the spiritual came the blues, gospel, and rhythm-and-blues. I heard all of that music growing up, and that has influenced how I approached classical music. I'm sure of it."],"Kathleen Blanco":["My values, our values, aren't about pointing fingers. They are about offering a helping hand.","Think about it: Every educated person is not rich, but almost every education person has a job and a way out of poverty. So education is a fundamental solution to poverty.","I care for you. I want to make life safer and better for you.","Let me be clear - I want all Louisiana citizens to have choice - including the elderly and persons with disabilities - and their families - who rely on the state for their care.","God calls us to care for our fellow man, especially the neediest. I feel that call to lift up the less fortunate; the call to improve our communities and our state. It drives me to serve Louisiana as governor.","Poverty is everyone's problem. It cuts across any line you can name: age, race, social, geographic or religious. Whether you are black or white; rich, middle-class or poor, we are ALL touched by poverty.","I know that government doesn't have the all solutions that real solutions do not come from the top down. Instead, the ways to end poverty come from all of us. We are part of the solution.","When I'm out hustling up new industries, I can offer Louisiana's many selling points. We have unmatched natural resources, a unique culture and fantastic workers.","At the state level, we must take a careful look at what went wrong and make sure it never happens again. The buck stops here, and as your governor, I take full responsibility.","The first light of day today revealed what we had feared. The devastation is greater than our worst fears. It's just totally overwhelming.","We didn't lose as many lives as had been predicted although we're still in the process of finding those we lost.","We have witnessed the most extraordinary devastation. The magnitude of the situation is unbelievable. It's just heartbreaking.","When your whole system, your whole civilized system goes down, this is pretty much what you get left with. We have no communications, no running water, no electricity, no real help."],"Kathleen Edwards":["There's nothing more confirming in your life than looking in front of you and seeing some really amazing people who you care a lot about who care a lot about you.","I find motion, literally, is where ideas come from. It's almost like a built-in rhythm section. The contents of the songs are about change, and a lot of that stuff happens when you're on tour, and you wake up and you're in a different place and you start thinking about where you're going and where you've been.","There aren't always answers for the questions you're looking for, so I have to make peace with that sometimes.","I know I'm not the 'Indie It Girl' and I'll never have a big breakout, big runaway success. And that's okay.","I'm a huge fan of a lot of different genres of music, and I really felt like somehow I had been pigeonholed a little bit - maybe of my own doing - and in a way where I felt like I was sort of falsely defined. What my music was being called wasn't really the music I was always listening to.","I was being categorized as some kind of twangy songwriter. And that's just not how I see myself.","I really love music that's on the periphery of not fitting into a clear genre. I felt like I was constantly being described as something I didn't really feel like I identified with.","I really get that some people like the roots-rock, storytelling thing that I was doing, and I'm proud of that.","You're reluctant to give too much away when you're going to put it out there for other people. It's harder writing your truest fears and loves and guilts, because you're not sure when you're writing the right story.","Co-writing is a very unnatural feeling. It's like wanting to document a feeling that you have and then trying to get someone else to describe it for you.","I didn't want to be this four-chord acoustic singer songwriter because that stuff just got so old to me.","People are really set in their ways in how they produce records, and I was at least open enough to where I knew I wanted to do something totally different."],"Kathleen Flinn":["There is an old story that says that Julia Child dropped a chicken on the floor when she was filming 'The French Chef.' And then - that, in fact, is not true. She just, you know, dropped some potatoes she was trying to flip in a pan.","I didn't realize it at the time, but writing obituaries was one of best jobs that I've ever had. After all, it's the only time that someone will ever laminate my work and put it in their Bible. Plus, let's be honest, writing obits in Sarasota is a very busy job. The old saying was that old people lived in Miami, but their parents lived in Sarasota.","Most memoir writers will tell you that the hardest part of writing a memoir isn't what to include, but what to leave out.","Americans and French are notoriously monolingual, especially earlier generations. Language is a sense of pride in both cultures. I think that the French and Americans are like brothers or sisters who are so similar that they irritate one another.","In many ways, journalism school and culinary school are quite similar. They both teach fundamental skills and habits, but ultimately you learn through on-the-job training.","I think we are all programmed to please as we grow up.","I think that women like to use different parts of their brain and their hands. And I think that cooking allows you to do that.","There are so many things you can do with a culinary degree.","I wasn't a great cook, but I was a passionate one.","Cut the things out of your life that keep you from reaching your dream. It doesn't matter if it's cooking or belly dancing."],"Kathleen Hanna":["In 1985, I was living with my sister in Virginia, and since I was still in high school, I worked at McDonald's to save money to get an abortion. It sounds really terrible, but it was the best decision I ever made. It was the first time I took responsibility for my actions. I messed up, had sex without contraception, and got pregnant at 15.","I'm not a goddess, for crying out loud. I'm a regular person who took feminism - which I have a deep connection to - and mixed it with music, which I really love to do.","I wanna be a legend; I wanna be a cult hero. I do!","I felt it was really, really important, not just in the vein of feminist erasure or whatever but also just as an artist that I honored my work.","I wanted to make something that I wanted to hear that I wasn't hearing.","Popularity is totally overrated.","I'm just working and having a good time and seeing what develops, which is so awesome, because you don't know what's going to happen, and I'm letting myself do that a lot more than I ever have.","I'm really annoyed by the wave of country music that's just a list of stuff. It almost sounds like L.A. people writing country music, because it's just a list of stuff: 'My pickup truck and my cowboy boots and my Levi's jeans and my girlfriend with the short shorts.' It's so boring!","You learn that the only way to get rock-star power as a girl is to be a groupie and bare your breasts and get chosen for the night. We learn that the only way to get anywhere is through men. And it's a lie.","There's just as many different kinds of feminism as there are women in the world.","I was in a band in the '90s called Bikini Kill, and we were so freaked out about documentation then, and there was the whole thing, not just about the male gaze, but that people were going to misrepresent you... a kind fear of the mainstream that a lot of us had.","I feel so lucky that I met the love of my life. You know somebody's in it to win it when they're changing your IV bag or you're having a seizure and they're holding you. And helping you to the bathroom. You know that they love you.","Since I loved underground music, I tried to carve a space for feminism within it. Those were my hopes.","I have late-stage Lyme disease. I was misdiagnosed for many, many years and told I had lupus, MS, Crohn's disease, even degenerative arthritis. And finally in 2010, I got the correct diagnosis, because on the last Le Tigre tour, I was having several seizures a day and at times not being able to brush my own teeth.","Certain people are like 'Oh, here come the Feminazis!' You end up acting 10 times nicer than you even need to be, to be the opposite of the stereotype like 'You're the man haters!' We're always bending over backwards being extra nice. And I don't know if being nice is my legacy.","Art revolves around creating something that isn't there.","People have always had these weird things about how you have to be really good looking to be a singer.","Feminism rotates between backlash and interest. And the cool thing about the Internet is that it's allowing women more access to their own history. Part of the problem before the Internet was that we didn't know which books to read. Someone had to tell you.","To make riot grrrl move into the future in a new way with a bunch of new names and a bunch of new energy, younger people have to learn about it and apply it to their own lives and own modern conversation. And they are.","I especially don't want men coming up to me and asking if sexism still exists. It's like, I'm seriously gonna barf a McDonald's salad on the next person to do that.","It's now taken for granted that women are in bands and you can say feminist things in your songs. But back in the early '90s, there was a lot of violence at Bikini Kill shows that people don't realize happened.","I was making stickers for guys' bands. I was in the front row photographing bands, booking bands, doing all of the kind of backstage stuff, and I didn't even think for a second I could do it, and then I saw Babes in Toyland, and all that changed.","You don't have to have magic unicorn powers. You work at it, and you get better. It's like anything: You sit there and do it every day, and eventually you get good at it.","I'm totally into Taylor Swift. I think she has super-clever lyrics, and I love that she writes her own music. Some of the themes she writes about are stuff I wish was there for me when I was in high school, and I'm so happy she really cares about her female fans. She's not catering to a male audience and is writing music for other girls.","I know I love sexy surf guitars, I know I love loud snare. I love really simple repeating bass lines, and I love weird mad scientist keyboard sounds.","So many women have experienced horrific forms of male violence throughout their lives, and why isn't there a song about how you get depressed because of it?","Women didn't want to be on the stage with other women because they didn't want their bodies to be compared. They didn't want another female act opening for them because of this weird competitive and tokenistic attitude.","I wanted to say to myself as much as anyone else that we made art.","I really like to talk about my work in a way that is complicated.","I just write what I want to write.","It's unexpected for women's issues to be brought up in places other than women's centers on college campuses or crisis places.","I think as a culture, we don't like conflict or looking at icky stuff - especially in our downtime.","There are so many great artists that are doing interesting things, that I don't want to focus on boring people.","If I had to choose between the band or the friendships, I'd choose the friendships at this point.","Facing sexism and racism and classism and transphobia, there are ways to choose to act in those situations, and there shouldn't be a prescriptive list of things that you have to say.","Sometimes, being a feminist artist, there are times where I'm in a position where I just want to feel like I'm saying all the right things politically, or I feel like I have to mention my own project over other people's projects. But I don't do that anymore. I just want to be off the cuff and honest.","Not to rag on myself, but when people say, 'What does it feel like to be an icon?' I'm like, 'My dog does not think I'm an icon, my cat does not think I am an icon, my cousin does not think I am an icon.' I have a really lovely group of friends, and I just don't think about it.","I always tell girls who say they want to start a band but don't have any talent, 'Well, neither do I.' I mean, I can carry a tune, but anyone who picks up a bass can figure it out. You don't have to have magic unicorn powers.","That's the great thing about music. You can find some '60s pop record and feel completely invigorated by it, even though it's so old.","Find something you really love doing and mix it with something you really care about. That's why I've had such longevity as an artist. I really, really care about ending violence against women, and I really, really love playing music. It's super enjoyable!","I go to lectures and girls are finding out about Bikini Kill or Le Tigre for the first time and are like,' This is my jam!' It still feels fresh to them.","I like loud snare, and I like really treble-y guitars, and that's just never going to change.","If people are like, 'Oh, you're an icon,' then whatever. But who thinks of themselves like that? It's not like I have posters of myself on the wall.","While everyone's experience of oppression is different and complicated and often overlapping, I really believe that if you have privilege, you need to learn as much as you can about the world beyond yourself.","In terms of men being feminist allies, it's just important to speak from your own place. I'd love to hear men singing about masculinity and the damage it does to them.","I can't constantly be trying to write the unwritten song, the song that the 15-year-old girl needs. I need to write the song that I need.","I always thought that putting tons of reverb on my voice was kind of the equivalent of airbrushing. And I wanted other girls and women to hear a real female voice that wasn't completely manipulated.","Singing is my life, and I have to do it, or I'm going to go totally bananas.","When I watch myself on camera, in any capacity - being interviewed, performing, 20 years ago or yesterday - there's a part of me that really doesn't grasp that it's me.","I'm in a really lucky position where people will be interested in whatever I do, but what I do is sing.","Defining art is huge; I feel like it's such a subjective thing. It's more like what's not art. You know what I mean? I think there can be an art in the way people live their lives, and art can be a gift someone gives to somebody.","I think music can definitely be art; I also think music can be crap and not be art.","Teachers are performers, just like I am.","I like art with a sense of humor. I don't have a huge art education to understand everything. I don't think that means that art has to be watered down to the lowest common denominator, though. I don't think you have to go to college to be able appreciate great art, but I like art that doesn't take itself too seriously.","If I can't sing them myself, there's nothing better than writing songs for other people and watching them be performed. It's kind of more thrilling than doing it yourself.","I'm not that interested in female superheroes.","I would love to make a bunch of country demos and write country songs for really great country singers.","I have chronic - well, I like to call it late-stage Lyme disease and not chronic, because I like to think someday I'll be all the way cured. It took me a really long time to get diagnosed, and I was misdiagnosed for a long, long time. I was very ill during the end of Le Tigre, which was kind of why that ended, amongst other things.","I don't want to be a historical action figure or treated like I'm dead. Like one of those people where they go, 'Oh, isn't she dead?' And then I walk up, and they're like, 'Whoa.' I can't really complain... because I've made myself into a historical action figure. I was like, 'Yeah, come on in!'","You feel like people are looking at you like, 'I wanted the old Kathleen. Where's the old Kathleen?' I felt that way in the beginning of Le Tigre. I felt people were like, 'You're not angry enough anymore.' People still ask me that. 'Are you still angry?' I'm like, 'About what? About that question? Yes.'","It's really funny - when I'm depressed or I'm having a hard time, I'll write really fun stuff. And then when I'm really happy, I write really depressing stuff.","What happens tomorrow is going to happen tomorrow."],"Kathleen Kennedy":["Sports teaches you to understand the meaning of a team. You need to be able to work with everybody; you don't have to be their best friend. You can experience the fun of competition and driving toward a common goal without pushing to bond in some major way with each individual on a project.","Success is always a matter of some luck and timing.","I know myself pretty well, and I know what I'm good at, but I also recognize when others may be better and so support and empower that.","Inside 'Star Wars' are values that mean something to people. It's aspirational. It's full of hope.","Everybody always asks us how we choose the movies we have going right now, and it's hard to explain sometimes. There's a randomness to the way things kind of happen and get done. And sometimes you have this perfect storm, and you have to accept that and do the best you can.","The producer, in effect, has to work as a translator. You form a very tight relationship with the director and writer from the beginning, and then you are constantly communicating to the various people that begin to come into the process, as you are trying to manage to hold on to a vision that needs to be communicated over a long period of time.","I don't analyze things all the time, I just do them.","From a producing standpoint, I think prep is everything.","Having a female point of view in the room - when you get into a discussion about behavior - who would say what and how they would interact with one another. In certain situations, women are going to have a different opinion on that than men. It made for a really balanced conversation in the room.","When I joined Lucasfilm, I immediately saw the true passion shared by 'Star Wars' fans around the world.","The most important thing is to have a point of view and have something to say. That is important if you are filmmaker or artist. That means you have to experience the world.","It's not just about casting female protagonists. It's gotta be across the board throughout the industry.","I don't know how to make movies without getting my hands dirty.","Creating authentic emotional experiences, whether it's 'Star Wars' or 'Spotlight,' are driven by characters and stories that are engaging.","Many great stories are father issues, mother issues or death.","I'm not great at talking about myself.","People want to make a distinction between what's commercial and what's art.","There's no way a director can communicate with every single person on the set and yet they need to motivate and instill an ambition to want to do their best work.","When you're relegated to go from movie to movie, so much of what you're doing is out of your control beyond creating the product.","You know, I've always been very open to any project.","There's nothing I like more than to have one of our movies run, and then I go to the ladies' room and listen to everybody talk about it. No one has any idea who I am.","A lot of these big movies are just a collection or a montage of big set pieces.","If it's a huge tentpole movie, for instance with a movie like 'Tintin,' a year and a half, almost two years in advance, we were developing a videogame campaign and massive consumer products campaign.","It's an interesting thing when you're casting a film - especially when you're trying to discover someone - you're waiting for someone to step into the room in an audition process and claim the role.","I think it's always wise to be concerned about any of the characters in 'Star Wars,' right?","The 'Star Wars' universe is full of technological and cutting-edge effects, which Base FX will be a wonderful partner to create with.","I always feel that the best kind of producing - and frankly, it has to do with what I like to do - is you're the big-picture person.","A lot of directors will do a certain amount of storyboarding and pre-vis, and yet when they get on the set, everything starts to change, and they have new ideas.","If all you're doing is playing it safe - trying to make the same movie over and over again - that's when the audiences say, 'Oh, this is just a moneymaking machine.' But if it's genuinely in service to the art form, then the franchise concept is being used in a way that's exciting.","It's not fun to lose.","I would hate to be in a situation where my entire focus was obsessing around the issue of whether we're going to win best picture.","I have a very fun husband. He's managed to hang on to every person he's known since grammar school.","When we built Amblin, we even put Murphy beds in there because we thought that was so practical. Why would anybody, if you were working on something, need to go home at night? You'd just stay there, wake up in the morning, and carry on.","We are going to hire a woman who's going to direct a 'Star Wars' movie. I have no doubt.","If we do want to bring a woman in to direct a 'Star Wars'... we don't want to talk somebody into it.","The 'Star Wars' saga is about a series of seemingly chance encounters. They impact the destiny of everyone involved.","My life is organized chaos.","Lucasfilm looks out for 'Star Wars.' What are the values inherent in 'Star Wars' that we want to protect? It's fragile to a certain extent in that it's a single IP.","Probably the biggest contribution that Disney has made to the Lucasfilm franchise management was their international component. That was something Lucasfilm hadn't made significant inroads with.","I've had filmmakers, I even had Bono come and talk to me about having a sequel to 'E.T.' help with an environmental message - I listened. I can certainly understand. I mean, the great thing about Bono is that everything he does is in service to a greater cause.","I think most fans of movies that have withstood the test of time don't like for them to be tinkered with. I think that's a pretty general consensus. You like to remember what you started with.","I think 'E.T.' came along at a time when it was probably meant to be.","Nobody understands what a producer does.","The problem with some truth-tellers is that they don't do it in a way that makes people want to listen.","I suppose I was always attracted to the producing function - trying to put things together and make things happen.","We don't have any intention of beginning a trend of re-creating actors who are gone.","I don't usually do remakes.","Not every script that rolls in is ready to shoot. Few are, actually. So you go back and work on the thing.","In the creative community, there's no excuse for not making a more equitable environment.","Audiences still crave storytelling.","We look at Marvel, but we're not trying to emulate that in any way. In fact, we talked often about how distinctive what we're trying to do with 'Star Wars' is from Marvel. They've been extremely successful in exploiting the characters in that universe, and we have a place. We have the galaxy.","I had a teacher who loved movies. He had a little theatre called The Flick, and he would let a bunch of us volunteer to work there, and he also let us make little movies in class.","My story sort of sounds ridiculous because the first movie I produced was 'E.T.'","You can recognise when a film-maker really, really cares about what they're doing.","Daniel Day-Lewis is extraordinary; I think he may be one of the best actors ever that we've worked with.","When Princess Leia hit the scene in 1977, she was a pretty formidable character.","I'm just a member of the audience with each project I work on, and I hope to never lose that. It's my touchstone. It's the thing I never want to overanalyze.","A successful film begins by choosing a director whose creative vision will define the choices made by everyone involved in the film.","I loved David Lean, he had a huge influence on me when I was going to film school.","It's funny where life can take you.","I find that a lot of directors are attracted to the dark side.","We have an amazing team at ILM who can create fantastic effects.","If you don't spend the time you need on developing characters and finding stories, complicated stories, the audience gets tired because they think they're seeing the same thing again and again.","It's a real privilege to make movies.","I started out as a camera operator. I was doing news, and I was doing sports - baseball games and football games. And I was acutely aware of women not really being in those roles then.","Sometimes women don't take the initiative that they should.","I've always said that I don't want to be in front of the camera.","We knew that for E.T. to feel real, you had to have some connection to his eyes."],"Kathleen Kenyon":["It has been mentioned that in Trench I there is evidence of three successive stages of these defences.","The contents of the massive banks behind these successive revetments makes it quite clear that the material was derived from the incorporation of earlier occupation levels."],"Kathleen Parker":["Earlier feminists were almost universally pro-choice and have dominated political debate until now. Having access to abortion was viewed as the only way women could have full equality with men, who, until recently, couldn't get pregnant.","I've never been a fan of presidents who place blame on their predecessors or who accept credit for events that couldn't have been engineered so soon in their tenure.","It's probably fair to say that Obama's ideas were too big for America's appetite. It would have been nice had he made a few incremental repairs to the economy and left the transformative events for a less stressful time.","People in positions of power and privilege have a duty to perform at a higher level. If not them, then who?"],"Kathleen Quinlan":["In a world where there is so much sadness and so much to be afraid of, good things do happen to people. Romance is still something we can find even if we're not consciously looking for it.","I am really a sea creature. Just a mammal that lost its fins.","I like to think of myself as kind of a sculptor, only I sculpt people.","At this point in my career, Apollo 13 is a million light years away.","I didn't think I was an actor and fought it for a long time. Nobody paid for that but me.","I filmed underwater for two days in the open ocean with dolphins.","I like to go to openings when I'm in it, or friends are in it.","It's just too egotistical to think that we are the only lifeform in the universe.","My agent was ambitious for me. But going out and chasing it? No, I'd rather work in my vegetable garden or play with my kid. I guess I'm kind of boring.","My dream job has already happened.","Some of the newer folks in the industry, I'm not sure they are familiar with the term acting. They don't understand what it means to play a character rather than just be a personality.","Some people are born gardeners, some are politicians. I was an actor. It took a great deal of pain before I figured that out. I didn't relate to most of it.","The heavy spacesuits are spectacular to look at but very hot. Putting one on was like going from chilly London winter weather to the Bahamas in just minutes.","There are not many roles where women are really active.","When not much is happening and there seems to be nothing you can do to change that, you do wonder. But I am an actor, like it or not. I stuck with it and took what was offered."],"Kathleen Robertson":["I think everyone can relate to the idea of making a bad choice - and knowing it's a bad choice - but doing it anyway.","If I put the top down, I start to burn in about five minutes.","I don't want to be more famous than what I have right now. At least in that sense where people come up to me in the grocery store.","I'm really into antiques. But really into it because of my father, who got me into them in the first place. He's an interior designer and he's really into going to antique shows and getting up really early on Sundays and driving out to these weird little towns north of Hamilton.","I am also really into religious artifacts.","There are a lot of stars I've worked with - big stars - who, when they walk on set, the energy just changes.","The director is a Canadian, Jeff Stephenson, and any time I get a script that has any Canadian component, I'm always immediately much more interested.","For whatever reason I tend to get roles that are more damaged.","First off, from reading the script and knowing that I was going to be apart of it, I'm a huge 'Wizard of Oz' fan so to be involved in something that was connected to the original books was really exciting for me and it was very different than anything I had ever worked on before.","Usually I'm very, very involved with choosing my character's wardrobe and knowing exactly how I want the character to look and this is the color palette and the textures and these are the kinds of shoes she'd wear.","You never know what you're getting into like some of the best experiences I've ever had have been movies that literally had a million dollar budget and everybody's eating Cheetos all day and running around without permits and trying not to get caught.","You have twenty-one days to shoot a whole movie and sometimes you go into that thinking 'ugh, this could potentially be really, really difficult' and it turns out to be the most incredible experience."],"Kathleen Rose Perkins":["I love working in London.","You just take any job you can that will allow your dream to come true.","I love Robin Wright. Kristin Wiig! I love those two women.","I graduated with a degree in musical theater and no skill in anything else to make money; I wish I had gotten a massage therapy kit or something where I could have made my own money.","I don't understand business minds. I consider myself an artist, and they just really don't mix.","I don't know if I necessarily fit in the action-thriller genre, but I'd love to do something where I could actually kick some butt and then tell a few jokes. That would be awesome! That would be my dream job.","Being fired from a show - being fired in any way, in any instance, any business - is just hard."],"Kathleen Sebelius":["The essence of good government is trust.","And under Obamacare, insurance companies can no longer discriminate against women. Before, some wouldn't cover women's most basic needs, like contraception and maternity care, but would still charge us up to 50 percent more than men - for a worse plan.","Although black and white Americans live, work, and learn together now, there is still injustice in America.","We have an opportunity to create a future where we are actually encouraging providers to keep people away from acute care, whenever possible.","The men and women who serve this great nation, whether they are stationed in Iraq, Fort Riley, or the Korean Peninsula, or they serve us at home as our community first responders, serve because they believe in America.","A healthy state encourages many voices - and lots of listening.","But the dollars spent on economic incentives and new investment strategies are wasted unless we seriously address the two most important economic issues in Kansas: education and health care.","But wishing our Kansas soldiers 'God speed' is not enough. We need to comfort, care for, and protect their families. And we should ease the financial burdens that these families often face.","I believe we all agree that, for the health of Kansas, nothing is more important than education.","If your voices are not heard, you can be sure that many others will be - in particular those who are paid to present a point of view, and often do it most effectively.","We have by far the most expensive health system in the world. We spend 50 percent more per person than the next most costly nation. Americans spend more on health care than housing or food.","General Motors spends more on health care than steel.","But for us Democrats, Obamacare is a badge of honor. Because no matter who you are, what stage of life you're in, this law is a good thing.","Insurance companies can no longer refuse to cover Americans with pre-existing conditions. That's what change looks like.","More than five million seniors have already saved money on their prescription drugs, and almost 33 million have benefited from free preventive services. The president cracked down hard on Medicare and health care fraud, recovering a record-breaking $10.7 billion over the last three years, protecting our seniors. That's what change looks like.","Being a mother is no longer a liability, and being a woman is no longer a pre-existing condition! That's what change looks like.","From 1965 to 1967, my dad, Jack Gilligan, served in Congress and helped pass landmark laws like the Voting Rights Act.","I was governor of Kansas when Mitt Romney was governor of Massachusetts.","Insurance companies can no longer refuse to cover Americans with pre-existing conditions.","If you're self-employed, between jobs, or can't get insurance through work, you'll have access to affordable health insurance as good as Congressman Paul Ryan's.","If you're under 26, you can stay on your parents' plan. You can go back to school or get extra training without fear of a health catastrophe bankrupting your family. Over three million previously uninsured young adults are now on their parents' plans.","Being a mother is no longer a liability, and being a woman is no longer a pre-existing condition!","I've spent my career fighting the worst practices of insurance companies.","I know how tough it is to stand up to powerful forces that prey on consumers.","There's a digital revolution taking place both in and out of government in favor of open-sourced data, innovation, and collaboration.","While closing our innovation gaps won't solve all our problems, we have some very real opportunities to improve the quality of care that's delivered to millions of Americans.","To me, part of the magic of this era is that the very same innovations, discoveries, and technologies that are allowing us to live longer, healthier lives are also creating a healthier economy.","What we've been finding is that when you remove the barriers to innovation, you can actually hold costs down while lifting entrepreneurs up and getting better health results.","We've been finding that when you empower engineers, scientists, and coders, they respond by creating new tools to empower physicians, patients, and parents.","Global health issues remind us - perhaps more than any other issue - that we are all children of the same extended family.","In many ways, human health is the great global connector.","I think one of the most underreported and untouted benefits of the Affordable Care Act is the real investments we are finally making in this country in prevention.","In this 21st century world, some of our country's most significant exports and imports extend beyond goods and services: They also include innovation, knowledge, discovery, and healing.","American research and resources have literally changed the face of humanity, by tackling deadly and once-deadly diseases.","There are people in this country who have waited for decades for affordable health coverage for themselves and their families.","The way the law is written, people who are under 250 percent of poverty, who have a marketplace plan, also are eligible to have some of their deductible and co-pay expenses paid through cost-sharing. Insurance companies basically front the money and are reimbursed by the federal government, by HHS.","The secretary actually already has a good deal of authority within the confines of the Affordable Care Act. Step one really is a question of whether or not HHS will continue to reimburse insurance companies for cost-sharing expenses.","Republican House members, including Tom Price, when he was still in the Republican House, sued HHS, suggesting that payment to insurance companies for cost-sharing exceeded the authority of HHS. That case was basically withdrawn when President Trump was elected, in hopes that the Affordable Care Act would be repealed - but we're back to the law.","I'm a former insurance regulator. What companies really want and need is some clarity about what the rules are.","The Democratic plan in the 'Affordable Care Act' has, I would say, more government support, more government regulation around trying to protect the finances of individuals, trying to protect people who had pre-existing conditions, making sure that they could actually be in an insurance market and not set off to the side.","The premium tax credit that is in the Obama plan is exactly that - it is a tax credit, and it isn't cash. It is a discount on the amount that you pay for an individual policy based on your family size and your income.","The lower income individuals, under any Republican proposal, at least that I have seen, are real losers in the framework because there is not enough subsidy, not enough assistance, for them to realistically participate in the market. Particularly if you halt or rollback the Medicaid expansion, which is for the lowest income workers.","A lot of the discussion about rolling back the Affordable Care Act is about dismantling the marketplaces where individuals are shopping for their own coverage when they don't get it in their workplace."],"Kathleen Troia McFarland":["Russia does not have a modern economy: it's a petro-power. The only thing it sells that the world wants to buy is oil and natural gas. When was the last time anyone bought a Russian computer? A Russian car? A Russian cell phone? Russia is so dependent on high energy prices that if oil falls below $100 a barrel, the Kremlin can't meet payroll.","As long as the United States - and the world - gets its oil from the Middle East, we will be drawn into the endless crises that seem endemic to the region. American energy independence would not only liberate us, it would also drive down the worldwide price of oil.","Every president, as he nears the end of his final term in office, thinks about his place in history.","Despite spending trillions of dollars and spilling the blood of thousands of Americans, we remain in servitude to Arab oil.","Reagan won the Cold War by first restoring America's economy and military and then staring down an economically weakened Soviet Union. He knew defeating Russia couldn't be accomplished without laying the groundwork.","Americans don't like to stand by while innocent people are killed and watch a human disaster unfold. It goes against our very fiber. We feel compelled to do something.","The problem with people who live in a world of speeches and books and theories is they don't know how to fix things in the real world when they go wrong. They feign ignorance, blame others, and make another eloquent speech.","The majority of people think their children's lives will not be as good as theirs. Nearly half of all Americans are no longer proud of their country. Politicians have become a despised breed.","It's the libertarians who want to reclaim decision-making for themselves. It's the small government folks who see government as a great Leviathan gobbling up more and more of their treasure and freedoms.","Americans are slow to anger, but once they do get angry, they are impossible to stop.","Krispy Kreme claims the 'batter is the best part.' Same with an Obama speech. It's all about what's on the outside, not what's inside.","The president doesn't order the military to seize political opponents. He doesn't order his intelligence community to lie about national security for political purposes. He uses the military or intelligence communities to protect the United States and our citizens, not to help him win elections.","While President Putin is busy redrawing the map of Europe, President Obama is busy filling out his brackets.","Don't worry, America. We survived Jimmy Carter, and we will survive Barack Obama. Only one questions remains... who is the next Ronald Reagan?","When the commander-in-chief sends Americans to fight and die, it should be only to protect our vital national interests, not for his own personal, political gain.","We in the West think of peace as society's default position. War is a temporary state of affairs that happens when peace fails. For us, war is something that has a beginning, a middle, and an end. When it is over, win or lose, the warring factions lay down their arms and resume their normal lives.","We realize too late that President Bush shouldn't have taken us into Iraq, and President Obama shouldn't have taken us out.","Whatever the final outcome in Iraq, our men and women in uniform should stand tall with pride for a job well done. It was our political leaders - of both parties and both presidencies - who failed us.","There is a growing sense among Americans outside the Beltway that while President Obama may be a good talker, he is a lousy manager.","In the Reagan administration, a great speech was just the first step in a long process. In the Obama administration, it's the only step.","In the real world, words don't automatically translate into deeds.","Egypt is the oldest, largest and most important Arab country in the region. What happens there affects them all.","Emotions may win arguments, but they don't win wars.","In foreign policy, the only thing worse than not doing something is doing something that fails or makes the situation worse.","You don't need a foreign policy expert to tell you empty threats and hollow promises don't work. Ask any parent of a rebellious teenager. If you don't make good on the threats, you're asking for worse behavior next time.","Al Qaeda attacked the U.S.S. Cole and bombed several U.S. embassies in East Africa in the late 1990s. We knew who did it, but we didn't go after them. Instead, we beefed up security at our embassies and changed the Navy's rules of engagement. It only served to embolden Al Qaeda.","Empty threats are often worse than saying nothing at all. It's like leading from behind. Eventually, no one thinks you're leading at all. And after a while, no one is even listening.","In politics, a picture is worth a thousand words.","One of the lessons of Vietnam, which we failed to heed in the Iraq war and the Afghanistan surge, is that before you commit U.S. military forces to aid or assist, it is essential to know what you want them to achieve.","Our military leaders don't seize power in coups; our soldiers and sailors don't go on strike for higher pay or benefits; our armed forces don't weigh in on the political process. In return, Americans have a sacred duty to treat them honorably.","Foreign policy is something Americans care about when the economy is good, and when it isn't, they hardly notice it. It's hard to worry about what happens in the Mideast when you don't have a job in the Midwest."],"Kathleen Turner":["If my ego was out of whack and I believed I could carry anything off, that would be a stupid risk. But so far there's been no reason not to try anything.","I figured as I got older, the good roles for women would be in the theatre. So 15 years ago I started building a Broadway career to try and develop the chops to be accepted as a great theatrical actress.","This is not about abortion or the antics. This is about pro choice versus anti-choice and government intervention in a woman's personal decisions about her life.","Crimes of Passion, which is one of the best films I've done, will live strongly in my resume, even though it didn't do well.","I know there are nights when I have power, when I could put on something and walk in somewhere, and if there is a man who doesn't look at me, it's because he's gay.","I do not admire young actresses whose foreheads cannot move.","I have health. I have a wonderful support system. I have the admiration of millions of strangers, which I do not underestimate.","I want people to like me. They don't have to always like my characters, you understand.","I would certainly choose my jobs depending on the actions of the character. I won't do anything that has to do with child abuse or women's abuse.","My father was a diplomatic officer. As a diplomat's daughter, you have to learn to present yourself very early on.","It begins and ends with money. It's absurd in this day and age when we need so much money for education, health, for people, that a $100 million dollars can be spent on a film. It's obscene.","Being a sex symbol has to do with an attitude, not looks. Most men think it's looks, most women know otherwise.","A woman can plan when to have her family and how to support a family.","As I traveled from one country to another, no one knew anything about me. So I could be anybody, I could speak as I wished, act as I wished, dress as I wished.","At about 40, the roles started slowing down. I started getting offers to play mothers and grandmothers.","Get more women producers, writers, directors. Why should we expect men to do it for us? They can't.","I always thought the point was to have a bigger life, to meet more people. So I don't understand Hollywood.","I am certainly a liberal.","I don't believe in simply accumulating money, but I have the luxury to say that, because I have enough for all my needs.","I find the idea of today's icons being teenagers incredibly uninspiring.","I had a great deal of pressure to move to LA after Romancing the Stone came out and I'd become very popular. But people came to me anyway.","I have a brother who's a psychologist. He says three-quarters of the world are born feeling that they will be affected by the world; one quarter are born knowing that they will affect the world.","I have no desire to play most of the roles being offered.","I never feel more alive than when I'm on stage. On film you feel chopped up, you can be acting from the neck up, or the hand, there is a lot of close up.","I never took to Hollywood.","I often play women who are not essentially good or likable, and I often go through a stage where I hate them. Then I end up loving and defending them.","I rent houses in LA when I'm filming. I find the isolation there terrifying. There's nowhere to go, there's nowhere to be with people. I'm not a beach bunny.","I think Europeans have enough tradition and respect for the experience and body of work of an actress that they don't sell out to the new ones.","I think my mission is to become the greatest human I can. I know that sounds pompous, but what else do we have?","I'm not a New York snob.","I'm not very active politically. The causes I work on offer immediate, practical, accessible help, and politics has never meant that to me.","I'm very old-fashioned in some ways because of my father, who thought that being a public servant was an honor. Everyone must find a capacity in which they can serve, because we all benefit from society.","I'm very practical. What I'm reaching for is individualism for women.","It never occurred to me that I couldn't change things that needed changing or couldn't have what I wanted if I worked hard enough and was good enough.","My husband says I can do anything I put my mind to, but the truth i, the only thing I want to do is act.","The older I get, the less I suffer fools gladly.","There are still women who are not living their own lives, but living through their men or their children.","What makes me angry? The education of children. How in God's name can you expect to have a functioning society the way we teach our kids?","What we need is more women writers, writing for older women. There are some actresses who have production companies and create their own material, and I truly admire that.","Women are responsible for creating their own roles.","You shouldn't get to live in society and give nothing back. People complain about their taxes, yet they do nothing for the community. That makes me furious.","The big gap between the ability of actors is confidence.","A woman my age is not supposed to be attractive or sexually appealing. I just get kinda tired of that."],"Kathleen Winsor":["Charm is the ability to make someone else think that both of you are pretty wonderful.","The king appeared... with his dogs and sycophants behind him.","It was a woman's bedroom, actually a boudoir, and no man belonged in it except by invitation.","Most people are so busy knocking themselves out trying to do everything they think they should do, they never get around to what they want to do.","The only genius that's worth anything is the genius for hard work."],"Kathleen Wynne":["Social justice is what drives me; it's why I'm here.","Ontarians don't want to believe that they are small people. They want to believe that they're open and that they're inclusive - and I believe that they are.","I do not believe that the people of Ontario judge their leaders on the basis of race, sexual orientation, colour or religion. I don't believe they hold that prejudice in their hearts.","My plan is to govern as long as I can.","People need to see where their dollars are going and what infrastructure is being built.","In the same way we have a long-term plan for building roads, we have to have a long term plan to build transit.","I came to politics later in life so I bring a different life experience to it.","There is a temptation in politics to look for simplistic slogans and to play the game in a way that looks like you're a savvy politician.","One of the really positive things about minority government is that there is the necessity to broker policy positions. What happens is you get a hybrid of what a single party might do. And I don't think that is a bad thing.","I'm committed to working with teachers.","I think there's not much patience for organized labour, period, public or private sector.","I've been driving since I was 19 years old.","I have no intention of disowning my record as a member of the McGuinty government.","In every election homophobia has been part of the landscape and in every campaign I've been able to become connected enough to my constituents that they know who I am and that I can be elected on my merits."],"Kathrine Narducci":["I secretly went to auditions, to open calls. I was ashamed. Anytime I mentioned I wanted to be an actress, my friends were not that supportive.","I got into acting classes. I didn't want to just go by luck.","Anytime I mentioned I wanted to be an actress, my friends were not that supportive."],"Kathryn Bigelow":["There's really no difference between what I do and what a male filmmaker might do. I mean we all try to make our days, we all try to give the best performances we can, we try to make our budget, we try to make the best movie we possibly can.","I don't do what I do to try and break a glass ceiling.","I think violence in a cinematic context can be, if handled in a certain way, very seductive.","If there's specific resistance to women making movies, I just choose to ignore that as an obstacle for two reasons: I can't change my gender, and I refuse to stop making movies.","It's irrelevant who or what directed a movie; the important thing is that you either respond to it or you don't.","Perhaps the only thing in my favor is that I am very tenacious. I don't take 'no' very well.","On the other hand, I believe there's hope, because the breakdown and the repair are happening simultaneously.","Something becomes personal when it deviates from the norm.","My dad used to draw these great cartoon figures. His dream was being a cartoonist, but he never achieved it, and it kind of broke my heart. I think part of my interest in art had to do with his yearning for something he could never have.","You have to disengage at some point in order to be fresh.","I thrive on production. It feels very much like a natural environment for me.","I'm drawn to filmmaking that can transport me. Film can immerse you, put you there.","The journey for women, no matter what venue it is - politics, business, film - it's, it's a long journey.","Character and emotionality don't always have to be relegated to quieter, more simple constructs.","I did a pilot for Anything But Love in 1988 that didn't sell.","I don't believe in censorship in any form.","I don't want to be made pacified or made comfortable. I like stuff that gets your adrenaline going.","I like high impact movies.","My movement from painting to film was a very conscious one.","One of the elements in the film that really fascinated me was not to look at the world in bi-polar terms of us vs them or east vs west, which was a by-product of the Cold War.","One should make morals judgements for oneself.","Our film examines the heroism, courage and prowess of the Soviet submarine force in ways never seen before.","Right now, there's the illusion of order and civilization, but there's a tremendous amount of economic tension in this country and the educational system is constantly eroding.","The Communist regime didn't consider this to be a shining moment in history and assigned no heroism to it. They classified it as merely an accident.","The urge to purge the material I come up with is, I guess, an ongoing process.","There should be more women directing; I think there's just not the awareness that it's really possible.","When he brought it to me four years ago, Rodney King had just arrived, I was involved in the clean-up of L.A. and I guess it was part of my experience.","When I made my first film, I didn't think of it as directing, so it wasn't like I set out to become a director.","When James Cameron brought me the script, which I developed with both Cameron and Jay Cocks, I wanted to make it a thriller, an action film, but with a conscience, and I found that it had elements of social realism.","Whereas painting is a more rarefied art form, with a limited audience, I recognized film as this extraordinary social tool that could reach tremendous numbers of people.","You never think the universe will reward your first choice - it just doesn't work like that.","War's dirty little secret is that some men love it.","I suppose I like to think of myself as a film-maker.","I'm drawn to provocative characters that find themselves in extreme situations. And I think I'm drawn to that consistently.","There's a conventional reaction when you see a star: You anticipate he'll be a part of a particular denouement down the road, so you don't worry for that character.","I do have to say I have been very fortunate.","I've always developed all my own pieces, and they're time-consumers.","You only have so much money to shoot a movie with.","Jordan is a very secular, Westernized country in some respects.","For some individuals - some soldiers, some contractors - combat provides a kind of purpose and meaning beyond which all else potentially pales in comparison.","I'm interested in social commentary.","What's most galvanizing for me is the opportunity to be topical and relevant and entertaining. That's the holy grail.","I'm definitely not drawn to shooting on a stage, I'm just not.","Am I a 'woman of action'? I don't think of myself that way.","I like to be strong.","I realised that there's a more muscular approach to film-making that I found very inspiring.","I began to exercise a lot of cinematic muscle with the precepts I had learned in the New York art world. Film was intriguing. I began to think of art as elitist; film was not.","Cinema has the capacity to be so physiological.","I really look for peak experiences and dramatic material that can allow peak experiences.","I can't stand outside myself and be anybody else.","My interest is to work in as uncompromised a way as possible.","I choose material instinctually - at the heart of it are characters that I feel are fresh and original, and allow for an opportunity to, I suppose, explore uncharted ground.","I need to have my hands on the DNA of a film.","It's totally thrilling to direct.","I don't know if I thrive in normal life."],"Kathryn Erbe":["'Yosemite' opened doors for me in the New York theater community in amazing ways. There's a whole world of fearless young theater makers here who put shows together on a shoestring budget and with gigantic hearts.","I think that I have never had the confidence to really aggressively get behind myself, and so what I do tends to be - I don't want to say 'sheepish,' but there is a sheepish quality to my ability to toot my own horn. I'm very Midwestern in that way. So I just do what I like to do, and what I think I do well is not very loud, necessarily.","Being on a major network television show is like long-distance running: You have to pace yourself and maintain your energy level and your morale. There's the role you're playing on the show, and there's also your behind-the-scenes responsibility to the crew, the guest actors and the fans - not to mention your own life as a mom.","After 'Oz,' I've learned how to check out and not let that stuff get in.","I forgot how scary plays are. The audience is so much a part of the night - I know that a lot of it is trying to shut that out and just do your own thing.","My heart grows every day through struggling and love of my kids. It helps balance everything else - the work and the world. It helps keep me grounded and in perspective of what is really meaningful to me."],"Kathryn Hahn":["And then 'Wanderlust,' Ken Marino and David Wain wrote the funniest - they're amazing. That was one of my most favorite creative experiences; we're all up at that commune, a small group of people. Everyone was funnier than the next. It was an amazing ensemble feeling. Everyone gave and took in the best way.","I think I was always a drama queen. I really, really, really loved playing pretend.","I feel grateful that the person I end up working with a lot is Paul Rudd. He's a prince among men, and so talented, and generous, and effortless.","I've always done theater. I've never thought of myself as a comedic actress in any way. 'Anchorman' kind of cracked that open. When I got a small part in 'Anchorman,' I didn't know it was possible on camera to improvise. So I was like, 'What's happening?'","I was on vacation with my family when I got the scripts for 'Wanderlust' and I was trying to work on the audition while I was on vacation. I remember a big gust of wind blew the entire script into the pool, so I had to dry it with a hairdryer.","'Free Agents' was an awesome experience. I never play the glam girl in anything, so that was a new experience. I would walk into one of my trailers and it would be like Spanx, a spray-tan gun, and chicken cutlets. I would have hair extensions. It was hilarious. Every day felt like I was turning into an awesome drag queen.","I don't want to ever say to somebody, 'You don't have to see it. It's not good.' I'm done with that. I'd love to just do things that I respect. That being said, I do have two children to put through school, so we'll see if I can put my money where my mouth is, but I would love to just work with people I respect.","Even the shows or movies that we know are not going to change the world, I love this. I love 'em. I'm a movie fan. I'm a nerd of any kind. I love a big studio comedy as much as I love the teeniest tiniest of indie. I'm not a snob in that way. I really do like a big, big studio comedy.","As an actor, you know, I love not being pigeonholed, which is great. No one really knows who I am. So that's a positive.","There was something about the Cleveland Play House that was the holiest place - you know, with the ghost light on the stage and the brick. It was just the most beautiful theater in the world.","There is a lot of kissing in 'Boeing-Boeing.' A lot! And not pecks on the cheek or lips - although there's some of that, too - but full-on, farcical lip locks. My poor husband. He definitely wasn't prepared for as much smooching as there is.","My life is a big accident, so where I end up, I think it's all accidents.","I feel like there is something about having a copacetic world POV that helps in making a comedy. Like, David Wain has such a particular way of looking at the world. It helps when everyone can see behind his eyes, you know?","A lot of actors are like, 'Why do I do this? My character wouldn't do this? This doesn't make sense.' And in a comedy, you kind of just need to walk into the door.","I have two young kids. So my VCR, like, you kind of have to sift through a lot of, like, 'Animal Mechanicals,' 'Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.'","I'm such a grandma. I don't tweet; I don't have a Facebook page.","I wish when I was 17, somebody had told me not to care so much about what other people had thought."],"Kathryn Harrison":["Like all holy figures whose earthly existence separates them from the broad mass of humanity, a saint is a story, and Joan of Arc's is like no other.","We know the seductive alchemy of art. To transform private anguish into a narrative of truth, if not beauty; to make sense where there was none; to bring order out of chaos - these are the promises art makes.","I like vampires, tuberculosis, anything to do with blood. Then I read a biography of Rasputin and found out he'd had this daughter who had become a famous lion tamer and been billed as the daughter of the mad monk who was able to hypnotize animals with her eyes. It gave me a vision.","I'm not an investigative journalist; I don't track crime or police blotters.","The Russian revolution is one of history's car wrecks. We do know the ending, but we continue to watch. It expresses aspects of human nature we find unacceptable.","I admire writers who succeed at what I consider the first demand of art: that the artist vivisect himself without pity, without hesitation, determined to reveal whatever he might find.","I am perfectly capable of writing things about myself that one doesn't discuss in polite company, but I was raised by people who said you don't discuss politics, you don't discuss religion, and you certainly don't discuss people's sex lives.","I've always been interested in the intersection between our rational and our unconscious lives.","Writing is how I stay sane. It's completely necessary.","I can't work out much about myself or what I see in the world around me unless I do it through writing.","I don't care what people think about me. I care what people think about my work. As a young woman, I was so eager to please that I served others' happiness and even their values before my own.","I was the good girl who never needed disciplining, who made straight A's. I applied and was accepted to Stanford University.","I remember seeing my father only twice as a child for brief visits. As I grew up, I invented a father who was larger than life - stronger, smarter, more handsome, and even holier than other men.","I was raised by maternal grandparents who were born in 1890 and 1899, respectively. They were British subjects; George V was the cousin of the tsar. The Romanovs were very real in their household.","Rasputin's daughter understands the revolution. She would have been an outsider, a spectator in the royal family and to the revolution.","I got history solidly under my belt, reading Russian history and biographies. I couldn't change the facts. I could only play with how the people might have responded to the facts of their lives.","Lives that are so conspicuous have a claustrophobic feeling. Once you're in charge of running a country, you're under scrutiny all the time. That's a trap.","Looking at the Obamas, they have a lot to manage with their children and having Michelle go out and have everybody comment on what she was wearing, what it means. I think you have to create a pretty large private world to live in.","It's hard for me not to have a great deal of compassion for the last Romanov family because, really, I don't know if a politically savvy ruler would have been able to make the situation turn out much differently.","I wrote 'The Kiss' 12 hours a day for six months.","It is my conviction that secrets are more costly in the long run than honesty.","I'm always sorry to finish a book, to let go of characters I love, people I've struggled to understand for years, people who evolve before me.","Whether writing fiction or nonfiction, I've never had the sense I was 'making up' a character. It feels more like watching people reveal themselves, ever more deeply, more intimately.","For years, the place I really lived - the world I watched, the one I thought and wrote about - was 15th-century France.","I'll never have so compelling a figure within my embrace as Joan of Arc; there will never be a book whose last chapter is so very hard to get right.","I used to enjoy reading true crime, but I've discovered that I don't have the journalism nose for blood.","When I was eleven, my mother gave me Robert K. Massie's 'Nicholas and Alexandra.' It was the first 'grownup' book I read, and I loved it.","I reread 'Nicholas and Alexandra' in my early twenties, and I never forgot the story.","How many artists subscribe to the notion that creative success depends on input from the fickle muse or her modern avatar, mental illness? Probably very few.","One of the things I find exciting about Joan of Arc is how clearly the story of her life reveals the creation of myth, a process in which every one of us is involved - every one of us who tells stories and all those who listen, each informing the other.","How much of a book review is about the reviewer? Sometimes it's mostly about the reviewer!","Having grown up so familiar with creating a pleasing facade, I now end up compelled to reveal things inside and say, 'Okay, now you really see me. Do you still love me?' And then it's never enough; it always has to be total self-revelation.","I have at last admitted that not only was I angry with my mother, but, in fact, I wanted to destroy her as a child. And I was so concerned to be a woman who was different from my mother that I had this vast architecture of rules.","I think in terms of the parents that I had, I sort of drew a bad hand, or bad karma; who knows? And I did have a family that was complicated, with some quite eccentric members. So there was a lot of grist there.","Joan of Arc was born 600 years ago. Six centuries is a long time to continue to mark the birth of a girl who, according to her family and friends, knew little more than spinning and watching over her father's flocks.","By the time Joan of Arc was 16 and had proclaimed herself the virgin warrior sent by God to deliver France from her enemies, the English, she had been receiving the counsel of angels for three years.","The least likely of military leaders, Joan of Arc changed the course of the Hundred Years' War and of history.","In terms of going back and forth between fiction and nonfiction - in which I'll include memoir, biography, and true crime - is that one relieves the other.","Because the kind of nonfiction I write has a plot, the events and transactions that make up a life, nonfiction offers me a break from plotting.","Shorter work - personal essays and book reviews - allow me to take a break from working on a book, which is good for the book and for its author.","I work in a small study on the top floor of a brownstone in Brooklyn - it's about 75 square feet, 11 taken up by book shelves along one wall.","The power of 'Madame Bovary' stems from Flaubert's determination to render each object of his scrutiny exactly as it looks, or sounds or smells or feels or tastes.","'Madame Bovary' advanced slowly, as slowly as it would have to have, given an author who held himself accountable to each word, that it be the right word, of which there could be only one.","I admire cool renderings of hot topics.","A lot of writers dwell on their relationships with their mothers, but only a few are worth reading.","I love any book that makes my family seem almost normal."],"Kathryn Harrold":["I'm always saying I won't get involved with an actor again, but then I realize how silly that is. The men I meet most often are actors.","I don't see any reason why I couldn't have a child when I'm 40.","I think I'm going to end up as one terrific old lady!","One of the reasons I moved to New York was because I thought it would be easier to say no to dreadful scripts. I wouldn't be tempted to fly back and do them. There are some things even I won't do.","I haven't had a great deal of luck with my career, have I? Maybe because I'm not pushy enough."],"Kathryn Joosten":["I am the only 'celebrity' to be public about my lung cancer.","Cancer will be with me for the rest of my life, be it as a nodule, tumor or cell someplace, or in my fears and anxieties.","Some people in Hollywood think of me as a model for dramatic midlife transitions: suburban housewife to Emmy-winning actress. But I never plotted a master plan for following my dreams."],"Kathryn Lasky":["I think the Lewis and Clark Expedition was the greatest undertaking in American History. I think landing a man on the moon pales next to it.","I feel I was always daydreaming, and I was always distracted.","Thinking - in particular abstract thinking, which most of us are introduced to through the study of mathematics and literature - helps us learn that we can become problem solvers.","I did not find that writing a diary with a lead male character differed in any essential way from writing one with a female character. They all had the same challenges in terms of attempting to establish an identity, coping with loneliness, friendships, relationships.","Never in a million years would I want to live at Versailles with Marie Antoinette or anybody else. I hate to tell you this but I did not even like visiting Versailles. I found it just too ornate. It was like a complete diet of cotton candy, marzipan, and whipped cream.","I have always been fascinated by paleontology and prehistoric people, and I've always thought that one of the most intriguing moments in human history was the birth of artistic imagination. I always loved those cave paintings.","When I was growing up I loved reading historical fiction, but too often it was about males; or, if it was about females, they were girls who were going to grow up to be famous like Betsy Ross, Clara Barton, or Harriet Tubman. No one ever wrote about plain, normal, everyday girls.","To me, the most important thing is to tell a good story. If I can do that, I think that enlightenment, respect of nature, etc. follows.","I was actually very hesitant to write about Marie Antoinette. She seemed at first glance - well, I cannot think of any other term - an airhead of the first degree.","I treat all my characters as if they were real, and I am scrupulous about the details of their lives.","I think Sacajawea was caught in a series of tragic situations - her kidnapping as a child, her being passed from tribe to tribe, being sold into marriage. However, I never thought of her as a tragic figure. I do not think she was a victim in the way we think of tragic figures.","I am not saying that the Renaissance in any way was a feminist movement - hardly. But the arts flourished, and in more social settings as opposed to being confined to the church.","Mary Queen of Scots is the most 'normal' girl who became a queen that I have ever written about.","Whether you are a twelve-year-old princess or a twelve-year-old regular kid, you need to know you are loved and respected.","I can read a newspaper article, and it might trigger something else in my mind. I often like to choose in historical fiction things or subject matter I don't feel have been given a fair shake in history.","I came from a home where everybody had a book.","With my husband, I have twice sailed across the Atlantic in a sailboat one third the length of the Mayflower. I know Atlantic gales inside and out. I endured one that lasted for three days with winds up to fifty knots.","I believe that reading widely is the best preparation for writing.","I love thinking of movie stars who could play the characters in the books I write.","I think, first and foremost, Marie Antoinette was intellectually impoverished. She really had never been introduced to the notion of abstract thinking - of thinking at all in any profound way.","My mother was a great advocate of women's rights, a member of the League of Women's Voters and lifelong member of Planned Parenthood and an advocate of a woman's rights in terms of reproductive issues. She was also a founding member of Common Cause in the state of Indiana.","I loved to read, and if I could've been a professional reader, that's probably what I would've wanted to be!","I always wondered what it was like to be just a normal kid growing up in trying times or during a great moment in history.","In our community here in Boston, we have had a tremendous influx of Russian Jews and Haitians. We call these people immigrants. But they come for the same reasons that William Bradford and William Brewster and John Carver came.","It is not a happy lot being a princess in any country, but especially Japan in which every tiny aspect of one's life is governed by the most rigid rules of protocol.","In terms of the Japanese royal family, they were considered the direct descendants of a god. They are regarded as all-powerful and possessors of unimaginable wealth, and yet they are, more often than not, literally prisoners of tradition.","I love thinking of movie stars who could play the characters in the books I write. I think Charlize Theron would make a lovely Marie Antoinette.","I hate to tell you this, but I did not even like visiting Versailles. I found it just too ornate. It was like a complete diet of cotton candy, marzipan, and whipped cream. It gave me the mental equivalent of one of those toothaches you get when you bite into something too sweet.","Manic depressive people often have incredible energy and a slightly skewed, but nonetheless valid, way of looking at things."],"Kathryn McCormick":["As a dancer, it's hard because there's such a perfectionist quality that you really have to let go of while you're acting, because nobody wants to a watch a perfect person on screen.","'Dirty Dancing', 'Grease', those were the movies that I used to watch over and over and over at my grandma's house when I was a little girl. I just remember watching them, and I always wanted to be Sandy, and I wanted to be Baby. I wanted to be the girl who's lifted in the dance, and she's beautiful and all those things.","I don't know where my career is going, but I know that when I'm not active, it really drives me crazy. So it wouldn't have to be a film with dance in it, but hopefully I'll be able to be somewhat active with the projects that I do or, if not, I'll have time on the side to do my yoga.","When I eat better, I perform better.","Dance is a physical and mental workout. Once you get your body moving, you'll see a difference."],"Kathryn Minshew":["Thinking big is only one part of being a successful entrepreneur.","Employees don't need to be best friends, but there does need to be a level of mutual respect and understanding.","I know, being the odd one out can feel brutal. But, rest assured, it's also wonderful - because your desire to do things differently isn't 'uncool.' In fact, it's the exact opposite.","You don't hire for mediocrity. Instead, you bring people onto your team because you know that they'll make a valuable contribution and turn in amazing work. But, in order to have that expectation, you need to make sure you're fostering an environment that allows them to do so.","Understanding your employee's perspective can go a long way towards increasing productivity and happiness.","Networking doesn't have to be all about talking shop over appetizers and bad chardonnay - do it in a way that works for you.","Millennials tend to appreciate regular feedback because they want to feel that their work matters and that they are making a difference in the workplace. As the youngest generation at most organizations, they also tend to be hungry for growth and development opportunities.","I always encourage people to learn the basics and nail the basics. Take the time to customize your resume and cover letter to reflect your qualifications, your research on the specific company and position, and how you believe you can add value.","As a cohort, millennials are unique in their social consciousness, and they make decisions based on that awareness. Keep them engaged at work by showcasing a culture of paying it forward and tying the day-to-day into the larger purpose of the organization.","It's all too easy to forget that cultural fit is a two-way street. Yes, the candidate needs to gel well with your company's vibe and mission. But, you also need to fit in with her desires, goals, and long-term career vision. It's not a one-sided relationship.","Don't let that nagging fear - that feeling that being different automatically qualifies you as being wrong - eat away at you.","Every generation brings something new to the workplace, and millennials are no exception. As a group, they tend to be highly educated, love to learn, and grew up with the Internet and digital tools in a way that can be highly useful when leveraged properly.","Sure, it's fun to chat with people with interesting backgrounds who seem to have a passion for your company. But a job interview is not a friendly chat. You need to determine whether candidates, can they really do the job. So ask them to prove it.","Starting with the values that feel authentic to who you are can serve as a compass to find more meaningful, fulfilling work.","I think the idea of a 'perfect job' is a myth - there are pros and cons of every position, good days and bad days, and even what most people would consider dream jobs come with their share of downsides.","Slouching or leaning back may send the wrong signals. When you sit down for a formal interview, lean forward to show interest and active listening.","The first time you meet someone, they're a new acquaintance, the second time you have a bit of an understanding, and the third time you meet them, you're old hats.","You know, as most entrepreneurs do, that a company is only as good as its people. The hard part is actually building the team that will embody your company's culture and propel you forward.","There's a dance happening on both sides of the table. Individuals are giving their personal and career values a lot more weight when it comes to finding a company that aligns with both. At the same time, companies are becoming a lot more transparent about their core values as an organization and the types of people they want to attract.","It's hard when you have a lot of naysayers to know when they might be right or when to ignore them and go with your gut and do something that may seem risky.","Recruiters sometimes have their wires crossed when it comes to what Millennials really want at work. While fancy perks are great, many Millennials are more excited about growing and thriving at a company that appreciates their talent and will help them continue to learn.","When you start a new company, you have to do it all. Yes, all of it.","Launching a start-up, you need to get a lot done quickly. Every day is different. Everyone pitches in with everything. It's easy for the founding team to say, 'We're flexible. We all help out with everything!' But when it comes to making decisions - that flexibility can spell inefficiency and disaster.","As a general rule, most recent university graduates know far more about U.S. economic history and 'The Lord of the Flies' than about how the modern workplace functions and how to succeed in it. Yet come senior year of college, it couldn't be more important or more timely to learn the basics of getting a job.","I didn't even know that there was a startup culture, that there were events with people who built businesses. When I started meeting those people and going in to that world, I felt like I was among my people for the first time in my life.","People actually aren't moving on from companies much more quickly than in the past, but there's a perception that they do, so companies are investing less in talent on the assumption that young employees won't stay long.","Job seekers light up when they find The Muse - we're a breath of fresh air in a stale, musty world. Our user experience focuses first and foremost on the individual, on providing them information - from content to company profiles - to make the most pressing professional decisions in their lives.","Having a co-founder is incredible, but it has to be the right person: someone who shares your values and ethics, absolutely, but also someone who has a similar vision for the future in terms of their appetite for risk, for low salaries, for hard work.","Millennials can be very hardworking, but it's easier to tell the story of the ones who are entitled.","The Muse should be a trusted destination for answers. A hand when you need one. Someone to talk you through tough decisions or situations. A starting point.","Work-life balance for founders doesn't look like work-life balance for everyone else. Starting a company isn't a nine-to-six job - or a nine-to-nine job, or a nine-to-midnight job.","Most weeks, I work 100-plus hours on TheMuse.com. There are definitions of 'work-life balance' that would say I have none.","I am a big advocate for having an open discussion about team norms and preferences. At The Muse, some of us like to start working at 7:30 A.M. Others focus best from 10 P.M. to 2 A.M. Create a culture where it's acceptable not to be working when someone else is working.","Done right, a performance review is one of the best opportunities to encourage and support high performers and constructively improve your middle- and lower-tier workers.","Even your most talented employees have room for growth in some area, and you're doing your employee a disservice if the sum of your review is: 'You're great!' No matter how talented the employee, think of ways he could grow towards the position he might want to hold two, five, or 10 years down the line.","Sure, you're an intelligent and highly capable individual, and you are learning a lot on the fly as you build your company. But you also need to come to terms with the fact that there are things you have chosen not to be an expert in.","Keeping a 'CEO blog' or 'founder's blog' can be a great platform for engaging your users in a nontraditional way, reaching people outside of your product pitch and building rapport without selling them anything except a belief in your ideas.","It's fantastic to be known as a company that responds quickly to users, shares great resources and friendly banter with them over Twitter, and forges relationships on Pinterest, Facebook, and every other social media site out there.","If you're able to arrange a trial period with a new hire, do it. It will give both of you a chance to make sure the position is a good fit - and can help you avoid being in the awkward situation of wanting to fire someone three or four weeks in.","As we've grown 'The Daily Muse' and met contacts who want to collaborate with us, knowing who does what has helped us be clear on who we want our partners to connect with - and makes us look buttoned up, too. SEO firm? Talk to our COO. An editor from the 'Huffington Post?' Meet our Editor-in-Chief.","Much-derided chick lit, chick flicks, and chick magazines have left ambitious women in a bind. Why is it that I, a young woman, can read 'GQ,' enjoy 'Fight Club,' and subscribe to 'Thrillist,' while the idea of a guy doing the same with 'Glamour,' '27 Dresses' and 'Daily Candy' is nearly unheard of?","Call it nature or nurture, there are differences in how men and women approach professional conduct, and facing these issues head-on will make us all more equipped to succeed.","For those working menial jobs or putting in 100-hour weeks for corporations, the lure of starting your own business can seem like a great way to get more flexibility, upside, and ownership.","When I started my first company, I still had a 40-hour a week job. I was working on my company on nights and weekends before I took the plunge and gave up a salary.","My first company failed completely. And it failed at about ten months old. I had about 12 months of savings, so when it failed I was thinking: 'Do I go back to work?' And at that point I believed so deeply in what I was doing that I couldn't imagine anything else other than trying to make this business work.","For almost the first year of The Muse's life, I would do 5 to 8 networking events a week. And I don't necessarily think that's the right path for everyone, but I realized that as an entrepreneur, one of my strengths was finding the right people who could help us. I didn't come into startups with any network.","The most important thing in startups is getting a product to market, as imperfect as it may be, and then iterating on it and continually making it better. A first rev of a site that has a few typos may not be perfect, but it was the start of something that I deeply believed in.","So many of my rookie mistakes could have been avoided by first-hand exposure to other, more experienced technology entrepreneurs.","When The Daily Muse initially wanted to launch a job board, our first ideas were insanely (and needlessly) complex. We wanted to integrate with social networks, gather rich personal data to build predictive algorithms, and put together numerous cool visualization tools before launching out to the world. We were just sure users would love it!","When talking to first-time entrepreneurs, I often ask them: 'How do you know that people want your product or service?' As you can expect, the answer is often that they don't yet, but will know once they launch. And they're right. That's why it's critical to launch as quickly as possible so you can get that feedback.","Get your product in front of actual, living, breathing strangers. Your college roommate's approval does not mean there's market demand.","One of the top causes of startup death - right after cofounder problems - is building something no one wants.","There were so many lessons I learned the hard way: missing out on a raise because I didn't know to ask, having colleagues consistently get credit for my ideas because of how I spoke up in meetings. When I looked for a resource that addressed the challenges I was facing, I couldn't find it. There was nothing.","We knew when we started the Daily Muse, we wanted a recruiting-focused business model rather than an advertising-focused one. We felt like publishers were being forced to go to more and more extreme lengths to monetize through advertising.","I had been a veteran of pretty challenging job searches, so I knew firsthand how frustrating, confusing, and demoralizing the job search process can be. Even after you get a job, many people join companies and discover in the first couple weeks that they aren't a good match with the personality and values of the company.","The idea for The Muse came from my own life, from a product that I wanted but couldn't find anywhere. Sometimes when you see a need for something in your own life and you can't get it, you feel crazy enough to make it happen yourself.","Take the time to match your application to the company and the role you're applying for. Even if it means you're sending out fewer applications overall, I think that can be really powerful.","Know your career values: Not your parents' values, not your friends', but what you personally value in work. For me, it's things like moving quickly and scrappily, ownership and authority over my work, and flexibility.","I grew up thinking that I would be an ambassador secret agent. From age 14 to right before I graduated college, I was really interested in the foreign service and the United Nations. I learned to speak French, Turkish, and all these things.","Something I've learned is that when people tell me I can't do something, I immediately wonder why and then think it through. It only makes me more motivated to prove them wrong.","I work late nights catching up on emails, and then, in the mornings, I just hop on my laptop right away. Then, every other day, I'll hop into the shower! My husband is horrified that I don't shower every day.","Previous experience, key skills, and education. They're undoubtedly all important things you consider when filtering through applicants in order to make a new hire. But, what's another major determining factor of whether or not that hopeful interviewee deserves an offer letter? Cultural fit.","With clearly defined roles and a focus on communication, it's much easier to make your company come across as well-organized and on top of things - because it actually is.","One classic mistake is when people give the impression that they just want a job, not this job or this company in particular. From a hiring manager's perspective, you're looking for someone who is excited about this role or this company.","It's not just hours and pay that are important anymore. People want to know what the company is like, what the culture is.","Being able to hear someone say, 'I found an incredible job on The Muse,' or 'It gave me courage to make a career change,' that's the motivating factor.","For many people, the hardest thing about job-seeking is figuring out where to start. All through college, I heard my friends asking themselves, 'What do I want to do with my life?' And guess what? After college, and after that first job, people still ask the same question.","As you move through the application process, keep refining the way you present yourself. Like any skill, you'll only get better with practice, and you'll only hurt yourself if you get discouraged too early. This is one race that's definitely a marathon, not a sprint.","You won't be exiled to permanent unemployment just because there's a picture somewhere of you holding a red Solo cup and looking underage. But, your Google results tell a story: Have you been in the news? Authored articles or blog posts? What types of topics do you frequently tweet about?","When I was still a bright-eyed McKinsey consultant, I remember hitting a point where I didn't know what to do next, and someone gave me the book, 'How Remarkable Women Lead,' and I read it and scribbled in it, and it felt like a guide in helping me figure out my career.","Employers are looking for individuals who can tell a story about what they bring to a particular company, and people with an understanding of that have a much better chance of getting to where they want to go.","We spend a lot of time on Skype and other video interviews, and it's funny how many people will prepare for a Skype interview by wearing a formal suit jacket with pajama pants on the bottom. Then suddenly, someone is at the door, and you have to get up, and you realize you're wearing reindeer boxers. Just put pants on.","It's often said that if doing something was easy, everyone would be doing it. I think that's particularly true when you're trying to make your mark or architect your own career. There's often not a path to follow.","There are always going to be obstacles. I think the bigger your aspirations, the larger the obstacles.","I'm an entrepreneur, so I've got to be ruthless about 'me' time if I want to have any left to myself! I make myself leave the office by 8 or 9 P.M. most nights, even if I do curl up with my laptop and a glass of wine at home to get through email.","For me, I spent months on job boards in 2010 and was frustrated by the experience. It's antiquated and clunky, and there was nothing about a particular job posting that helped me favor one company over another. You literally get a list of 5,000 jobs that look the same.","Ultimately, I think it takes a certain grit and determination to constantly re-prove to people that you're just as dedicated, just as determined, and just as capable as the entrepreneurs around you who may better fit the physical pattern - but on the flipside, women who succeed often become razor sharp through the process.","I probably have a small number of people that are consistently advisors and mentors, but I'm much more likely to have a broader array of... almost like an unofficial board of advisors, where I know that certain people are going to be good for certain types of topics.","I tend to find you have to be fairly vulnerable to get something... to get a perspective worth having. Which can be controversial. But I find telling someone what you're thinking about, what you want, and what you're afraid of can often help them give guidance.","Work is personal in the same way that finding a friend or partner is personal.","It's easy to imagine that because a certain company has a prestigious reputation or everyone says it's a great place to work, that it will be the perfect fit for you. But, in reality, the search to find a career is a much more individual process."],"Kathryn Morris":["'Sophie's Choice' is actually the reason I became an actress."],"Kathryn Newton":["I was on a sitcom called 'Gary Unmarried' for 37 episodes, and then I was in 'Bad Teacher' with Cameron Diaz and Justin Timberlake.","I just love to watch people get scared. It's like, 'Yes, I accomplished my goal!'","I loved 'Paranormal Activity.' It was one of my favorites before. It was a tradition; my friends and I went every year."],"Kathryn Prescott":["When you hear someone say something homophobic, it really ages them. It sounds old-fashioned.","I actually hate reality TV! I know people love it, but when I watch, I'm analytical, and I'm like, 'This can't be real because of the camera position! And I see the cuts!'","My parents were always pretty free with me. They were of the school of thought that if you really cramp down on someone and tell them not to do all these things, it's gonna become like forbidden fruit.","Just because we don't recognise someone from an area of our own lives, somehow it has become easy to simply ignore them and walk away.","I know people who have been without a home for ages, and lots of my friends are sofa surfing because they are in between jobs or saving for degrees and other studies - paying £500 rent every month is just not feasible for them.","If you're an actor, you're at the mercy of a script. You've got far more control if you're the photographer.","Hopefully I won't be 35 still playing a 16-year-old.","These people living on the streets could have been friends you once knew. They are people who have somehow fallen through the gaps and found themselves, often through unimaginable circumstances, on the cusp of existence. In another reality, this could easily be me or you.","I was at college studying psychology, philosophy, textiles and drama. But because I wasn't one of those all-singing, all-dancing stage-school kids, I just assumed I'd never become an actor.","The great thing about 'Skins' is that it's not '90210.' We don't have to look stick-thin and ripped. Those shows send out the wrong messages by showing body-perfect people but not mentioning that they spend four hours a day in the gym to look that way.","I don't have a type looks-wise, but all my exes have been funny, open-minded and ambitious. I can't stand men with no passion in life.","The reason most people get eating disorders is because they want to be skinny, but they do it stupidly, and they stop eating completely - nobody knows anything about nutrition or exercise. I think it should be a separate subject in school."],"Kathryn Schulz":["The miracle of your mind isn't that you can see the world as it is. It's that you can see the world as it isn't.","We're terrified of not having the answers, and we would sometimes rather assert an incorrect answer than make our peace with the fact that we really don't know.","If you want to live a life free of regret, there is an option open to you. It's called a lobotomy.","Regret doesn't remind us that we did badly. It reminds us that we know we can do better.","The point isn't to live without any regrets. The point is to not hate ourselves for having them.","The kinds of things that we can make mistakes about are essentially unlimited in number.","If it is sweet to be right, then - let's not deny it - it is downright savory to point out that someone else is wrong.","Parading our own brilliance and exulting in other people's errors is not very nice. For that matter, even wanting to parade our own brilliance and exult in other people's errors is not very nice, although it is certainly very human.","As a kid, I lived almost entirely inside books, and eventually the books started returning the favor. A lot of my internal world feels like an anthology, or a library. It's eclectic and disorganized, but I can browse in it, and that hugely shapes both what and how I write.","I can usually find my own way out of whatever dicey literary or linguistic situations I wander into, but I have to work much harder at the science.","First, philosophy concerns itself with all kinds of issues that don't get much airtime in day-to-day life. What's the nature of reality? Can we ever truly know anything, and if so, how? What does it mean to be a moral agent? And while we're at it, is there any such thing as agency anyway?"],"Kathryn Stockett":["When I grew older and awkward, when my parents divorced and life had gone all to hell, Demetrie stood me at the wardrobe mirror and told me over and over, 'You are beautiful. You are smart. You are important.' It was an incredible gift to give a child who thinks nothing of herself.","What conflicting ideas that we love and embrace these women, and entrust them to raise our children and to feed us and to bathe us, but we keep something as silly as a bathroom separate.","Having a separate bathroom for the black domestic was just the way things were done. It had faded out in new homes by the time the '70s and '80s rolled up.","I have never been more proud of the United States than I am this year. We have elected an African-American president. We have the stellar Michelle Obama setting the standard for American women. I simply cannot say it enough: look how far we've come.","What a dichotomy. What conflicting ideas that we love and embrace these women, and entrust them to raise our children and to feed us and to bathe us, but we keep something as silly as a bathroom separate.","As I wrote, I found that Aibileen had some things to say that really weren't in her character. She was older, soft-spoken, and she started showing some attitude.","But certainly in my grandmother's time - and when I was growing up, yeah, Demetrie's bathroom was on the side of the house, it was a separate door. Still, to this day, I've never been in that room.","When Demetrie got sick, we knew it was our responsibility to take care of her and pay her medical bills. And we embraced that. But the tricky part is, like so many families in the South, we also expected her to use a separate bathroom, to use separate utensils.","Your white uniform as a black domestic was your ticket anywhere in town.","I'm a Southerner - I never take satisfaction in touching a nerve. I guess if I'm forced to find a good side, I'm glad that people are talking about an issue that hasn't really been discussed all that much. I'm glad that people are talking about it from the black perspective and the white perspective.","I started writing it the day after Sept. 11. I was living in New York City. We didn't have any phone service and we didn't have any mail. Like a lot of writers do, I started to write in a voice that I missed.","I grew up in the 1970s, but I don't think a whole lot had changed from the '60s. Oh, it had changed in the law books - but not in the kitchens of white homes.","As children, we looked up to our maids and our nannies, who were playing in some ways the role of our mothers. They were paid to be nice to us, to look after us, teach us things and take time out of their day to be with us. As a child you think of these people as an extension of your mother.","Some readers tell me, 'We always treated our maid like she was a member of the family.' You know, that's interesting, but I wonder what your maid's perspective was on that.","On the one hand I wonder, Was this really my story to tell? On the other hand, I just wanted the story to be told. But the truth is that I didn't think anybody was going to read it.","I was born in Jackson, Mississippi, in 1969, in a time and place where no one was saying, 'Look how far we've come,' because we hadn't come very far, to say the least. Although Jackson's population was half white and half black, I didn't have a single black friend or a black neighbor or even a black person in my school.","Demetrie came to wait on my grandmother in 1955 and stayed for 32 years. It was common, in Mississippi, to have a black domestic cleaning the kitchen, cooking the meals, looking after the white children.","That white uniform was her 'pass' to get into white places with us - the grocery store, the state fair, the movies. Even though this was the 70s and the segregation laws had changed, the 'rules' had not.","I sit in my little office and I feel like I've got all my readers staring at me.","The first book you write because of the way it makes you feel. The second one you can't help but wonder how it's going to make the reader feel.","I'm a Southerner - I never take satisfaction in touching a nerve.","I'm really incredibly stubborn - you can ask my ex-husband. I think when you tell me 'no', if it's something I really want, I'm just going to push harder.","It can be really powerful to write something when you're sad.","I think if you're president, color goes away completely: you're president and it doesn't matter if you're white, green or purple.","I do wish that people talked about the subject of race, especially in the South."],"Kathy Acker":["That's what the right-wing is good at: figuring out the left wing.","One of the reasons I think the ultra right-wing has such power in this country is that no one talks out.","You can do whatever you want with my work.","Well, fear and homophobia are both pervasive.","And I'm working at trying to find a kind of language where I won't be so easily modulated by expectation.","And internalization is used in this country as a very effective political tool.","But guys such as Allen and William are more supportive than most men.","But I still don't have a clear idea of what my voice is.","First of all, writing at best - certainly fiction writing - more and more I think is magic.","I found my voice was a reaction to all that voice stuff.","I mean, once work's out there it's meant to be used.","I mean, they censor your work when they're scared of it.","I might be writing what people expect me to write, writing from that place where I might be ruled by economic considerations. To overcome that, I started working with my dreams, because I'm not so censored when I use dream material.","I question: do we really understand the differences between modernist and postmodernist?","I think it's really important to find out why people hurt you or try to oppose you or whatever.","I think the best thing in cases of censorship or things like this is to get as much media as possible.","I think what we have in this country is a little more dangerous in a way because it can't be seen fully. It's sorta internal censorship. We censor each other.","I understand that postmodern literature probably means people like DeLillo, The Fiction Collective, but I don't get it that those writers are really influenced by postmodern theorists.","I understand that when people read my books that there's something there - but I don't identify with it.","I wasn't really into body piercings until I found that about half my female students had them.","I write it to get it out of me. I don't write it to remember it.","I'm really fascinated and you know I've been wondering about that usage of language, various breathing techniques and why in these practices language is being used in another way.","I'm very staid compared to my students, actually.","On the surface we all act like we all love each other and we're free and easy, and actually we're far more moralistic than any other society I've ever lived in.","Some of the stuff about Yogi energy is really fascinating.","The literary culture, if you examine it, the high literary culture is that which preserves the government and you know it's really the talk for those who have.","There's a backlash against womyn that's really bad right now.","Traveling around I don't think people are that horrible, I think they just don't know.","We get on the bandwagon in all sorts of ways - you know minor ways and major ways - like what you've just encountered which isn't censorship exactly, it was something sort of uglier in a way.","We've been very bad at understanding why the right-wing does things.","Well, I think writing is basically about time and rhythm. Like with jazz. You have your basic melody and then you just riff off of it. And the riffs are about timing.","Yeah, I mean, I put work out there for people to use and I'm grateful when you use it.","You know I've had work banned."],"Kathy Baker":["I did not see myself as a leading lady. I thought I was really funny-looking and I would never be the lead, and I certainly would never do film or television. I wanted to do theater. I wanted to be the grand dame of the American stage.","I want to be the only American actress who doesn't do any plastic surgery or anything. I think older faces are great.","For me, the acting part - and I have to say it makes me a little worried about my own psychological make-up - is that I just love to hide in other characters. I don't like to get up in front of people and talk as Kathy Baker. But as soon as you say 'action,' I'm lost in that character.","The Quaker upbringing was not strict, but it was frugal. Extremely frugal. One was always encouraged to give away one's worldly goods.","I try to give all my characters a sense of humor, so I guess I feel like I have done comedy, but maybe I'm better known for drama.","I worry about my face not having expression. I've never been known for glamour, so it's probably easier for me than it is for someone who has been known for her incredible beauty and glamour. I always wanted to be Geraldine Page, who was just a fabulous actress with just a nice, normal, expressive face.","I've always believed that if you are willing to play your age that you will work, so it's the thing of continuing to play your age and accepting it when you're younger and you suddenly realize, 'Oh, now I'm playing the mom,' 'Oh, I'm playing the grandma.'","I love to do comedy, and I don't think of things as drama or comedy. I think that if it's a funny line, it's a funny line. If it's a funny moment, it's a funny moment.","When you're younger, the mental strain of being a successful actor, jumping from role to role, and trying to have some kind of personal life, can really be terrible.","I heard Tony Bennett say that when you're a big deal early on, you have to maintain that level forever, and it's very scary. You have to keep hitting those home runs, turning out hits.","I've heard that kind of weird backward compliment often - 'She's so talented, but not pretty.'"],"Kathy Bates":["I want to be defined by my own essence.","After winning the Oscar, I was committed to do 'Fried Green Tomatoes,' but I didn't know what the next thing would be after that. It was a scary time. But the advantage of TV is the regular work. All you need is a hit series, I guess.","Every time an Oscar is given out, an agent gets his wings.","It was also wonderful to have the prospect of playing with Jack Nicholson. It was a terrific part, a terrific script, with Alexander Payne and Jack Nicholson. You can't get any better than that!","Jack made it very comfortable for me on the set. We'd met socially before but never worked together. You know, he's very professional, very disciplined and he's always prepared and knows his lines.","I look for a role that hopefully I feel empathy with and that I can understand and love, but also that has that challenge for me to play - a different kind of role, a different type of character, a different time period.","I try to always stretch myself to fit the characters that have been presented.","Alexander Payne's very specific. His scripts are always complete when you start working on them.","The Oscar changed everything. Better salary, working with better people, better projects, more exposure, less privacy.","I think that being in an environment is a much richer experience than just working on a soundstage.","My mother used to tell this corny story about how the doctor smacked me on the behind when I was born and I thought it was applause, and I have been looking for it ever since.","I was never an ingenue. I've always just been a character actor. When I was younger, it was a real problem, because I was never pretty enough. It was hard, not just for the lack of work, but because you have to face up to how people are looking at you.","I'm not that conservative. I do feel - I guess I'm more of a Democrat at heart, although I've never affiliated myself with a particular party.","For a long time I did not want to do television because I did not want to get stuck playing the same person. I wanted the ongoing challenge of a variety of roles.","Drama comes more naturally to me. It's the comedy you really have to delve into.","I went from years of honing my craft to sudden recognition. It was quite a life changer.","I'm not a stunning woman.","I have always had a problem with my weight.","The roles I was lucky enough to get were real stretches for me: usually a character who was older, or a little weird, or whatever. And it was hard, not just for the lack of work but because you have to face up to how people are looking at you.","And people are always saying: 'Well, you go to Hollywood and you get yourself a film career or a TV series, and then you can do anything you want. Because then you've got the clout.' That had always sounded like a lot of hooey to me, but now I think it's true, unfortunately.","I hope I look skinnier in 3D. I hope I don't look three times as fat. That'll be disappointing.","I haven't talked much about being an ovarian cancer survivor because I don't really want to define myself that way.","I have to pay the bills just like everybody else, but it also pays my soul to work.","I'm very lucky to be able to do what I love to do, and I hope I can keep doing it for a while."],"Kathy Freston":["Here's the secret to weight loss: It's all about crowding out, not cutting out.","What you want is to rev up your metabolism so that you are burning fat and calories, not preserving fat and calories.","Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. When you feed yourself what your body needs when it needs it, that's love. So give your bod some TLC and sit down and enjoy a good, substantial breakfast.","Whole foods like grains and beans release their sugar very, very slowly because of the fiber in them, and they don't give you a sugar rush. They feed your cells as needed, and as a result, you have loads of stable energy that powers you through the day.","Hunger and self-control do not go hand in hand.","When you gradually add in nutrient-dense, fiber-rich foods, you simply stop feeling cravings. You run out of space in your belly for the old junk. Instead of craving, you feel full, fulfilled, and content.","The reason fiber helps us control our weight is that it fills the belly yet yields few calories since fiber is, for the most part, not something that we can digest.","I think that food ties us to our community and our traditions, and it's the thing that makes us feel good and connected.","I missed a tuna-fish sandwich with mayo on toasted wheat bread more than anything. Six months after I went vegan, I snuck into a deli and took one home. And, of course, it wasn't nearly as good as I fantasized. It tasted, well, fishy.","Most diets would have you cutting things out from your diet; they are about denial and discipline.","You can do something as simple as drinking two cups of water before a meal to fill your belly a bit so that you don't overeat, or change up your cheese from dairy to nondairy.","You don't need to stick to tough rules or overnight changes; you need not rely on hardcore discipline that makes you hate your life. You need only focus on progress, not perfection. Lean in to the process of losing weight, and it will happen easily.","We all thought of chicken as lean, protein-rich food that's good for weight watching, but the truth is chicken might actually be making us fatter!","So if you serve a whole chicken to your family like grandma did, you may be serving them 10 times as much fat than the days of yesteryear. That's a whole lotta fat, and big trouble for the waistline.","We've all seen chicken portrayed as the low-fat, heart-healthy alternative to red meat for years, but it no longer adds up. You might want to lean away from eating birds and lean toward more plant-based options of protein like black beans, lentils, tofu, chickpeas and whole grains.","Though I'm vegan and advocate that others eat a plant-based diet, I know that many people aren't quite ready to take that step in whole.","So if you're rooting around for something to eat, grab an apple while you're looking, and usually by the time you're finished eating it, your hunger will have been sidelined; it's crowding out at its best!","Personally, I enjoy a bowl of brown rice for breakfast most of the time.","I grew up in Doraville, Georgia and I ate barbecued ribs and chicken fried steak, and all kinds of cheesy grits, you know, and I never even thought twice about it.","And check this out: If every American had one meat-free day per week, it would be the same as taking eight million cars off American roads in a year.","My favorite meal is I'll make like a three-bean soup and I freeze half of it. But I'm also a big fan of meat alternatives, so I can still have my chicken and mashed potatoes and green beans, but I just have the chicken from a plant-based thing.","I was weaned on chicken-fried steak and hominy grits with goopy gravy all over. I loved meat and wore fur.","I drive a car that has pleather seats."],"Kathy Giusti":["Our healthcare environment is incredibly complex and is changing rapidly.","Although not yet routine, many cancer centers have the technology to sequence some or all of a patient's cancer genome. This can provide massive amounts of valuable information about your cancer, including whether you have genetic mutations and other abnormalities for which new drugs are available.","I'm happy to say that I am in remission. That R word is something critically important to cancer patients, especially in a disease like myeloma. But I never lose sight of the fact that there is another R word called relapse.","In 15 years, we've raised $225 million, sequenced the myeloma genome, and opened 45 trials of 23 drugs - six approved by the FDA - which have doubled the life span of multiple myeloma patients. I've taken both Velcade and Revlimid, which we helped develop.","I always say, the greatest cost of leading is the cost of paving the way.","The most important thing a leader can do is set the vision and don't stray. We said, 'We are a research foundation. Our mission is to accelerate cures.'","Every time I go back to the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute to wait for my test results, and I wonder if I've relapsed or if I'm doing okay, I don't think about my company. I'm proud of everything we've done, but at the end of the day, it comes back to family. I'm still a wife, a mom, a sister - all of those things.","If I've learned anything, it's to live in the moment, and the gift that cancer gives you is, you just assume I'm only here today, and I am going to seize that moment and cherish it.","I quickly discovered that scientists go where the funding is, so I knew I had to start a research foundation. If you don't raise money and provide research grants, you'll never attract scientists, and if scientists aren't working on a cure, there isn't going to be a cure.","When I got really sick and needed a stem cell transplant, I was fortunate to have a twin sister as the donor.","I hope I can become a voice for all cancers and all patients.","Despite the fact that one in every two men and one in every three women will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime, no one ever expects it to happen to them. I surely didn't. I was an otherwise healthy 37-year-old when I was diagnosed in 1996 with multiple myeloma, the same rare cancer Tom Brokaw has.","Being treated by a doctor who specializes in your kind of cancer is so important, especially for those of us who have rare or very rare cancers. They will have access to newer treatment options that may be offered only at big academic cancer centers, so you don't miss out on treatments that could help you."],"Kathy Griffin":["If you see me on Friday, you'll see different material on Saturday night.","I have no limits, no filter, no class, no poise. No decorum. Just fun.","No, I love Montreal... I think I love Montreal more than Montreal loves me... I love the food there.","I also love Mole, the unsung hero of reality programming.","Well, my whole thing with gossip is I couldn't care less if it's true.","I think I love Montreal more than Montreal loves me... I love the food there.","The thing that bums me out about 'The Real World' is I don't want to believe that teenagers are that stupid.","The great thing about celebrity culture is that they can't seem to stop themselves from displaying their ridiculous behaviour. I feel it's my job as a serious investigative journalist to witness all kinds of behaviour and then report back to the audience through the prism of my own anger and bitterness.","Pretty much everywhere I go, I'm pretty much thinking I'm going to be bounced. I am still the outsider who snuck into the party. I identify with the regular person, because that is who I am.","I prefer being known for my stand-up because I write it. I love being an actor, and saying other people's words is great. But then, when I do stand-up, I love getting my own point of view out there.","That's life when you're on the D-list.","I'm not always in that good with middle-aged heterosexual men.","The thing that cracks me up is how these reality characters start out thrilled and excited just to be on television, and how they move to thinking they are as big as the Friends.","Gwyneth Paltrow names her kid Apple. I'm not going to let that stand.","I love Mariah Carey. Remember the breakdown? I loved the breakdown.","Have I gone too far?","The beauty about the D-list is that people who are on it probably don't know they are.","I do road gigs occasionally but I don't want to go out on the road for months at a time.","I have friends who are going through chemotherapy, and they make the darkest, most hideous cancer jokes you've ever heard.","So I wonder if anything should ever be off limits.","So yes, I say things I regret constantly, and I just can't help it.","Food is my thing, I do not smoke or drink, so food is my vice.","I hate it, it is tedious... when I write for my act, it is very improvisational, I write bullet points, I cannot sit in front of a computer; that is not my style.","My act is based on my life.","I'm also doing a special for Comedy Central called Autobiography. It's going to be a spoof of Biography.","I think a Celebrity Survivor would be great.","That's what I loved about Temptation Island. I don't even know why they did it.","I'm basically always on tour.","I can say whatever I want. So do not bring the kids. It's definitely rated R.","I am in love with Larry David.","It was a nightmare having cameras in the house 10 hours a day for a month.","I love to make fun of fashion because it is just so silly.","I'm on every worst-dressed list imaginable.","My act has always reflected what's going on in my life.","I'm always listening and watching; my ear is like a boom mike. And judging, frankly. Constantly judging.","A lot of celebrities, especially when you're talking about the really big ones, live in what I call the fame bubble. Nobody ever says no to them or challenges them or even teases them.","A lot of stars don't have a sense of humor.","I don't like doing movies, period. Movies are hard. I like TV.","I actually have to pick and chose stuff that I know I'm going to bomb at.","But if something funny happens, I can't resist. I have to tell the people.","I also don't have a desire to be on the A-list. I feel more people can relate to the D-list than the A-list.","It is a challenge, with the global fame, to try to act like I put my pants on one leg at a time, when in fact I have Pippa Middleton help me put my pants on every morning. She's my lady-in-waiting as well.","I'm not somebody who no matter where I go there are paparazzi or any of that nonsense. But I have a little window into that world and I can enter it and dance around. I want to be the audience's ticket into the party.","Oh, I constantly say things that I regret. I mortify myself constantly. But that's just part of the deal. I'm not really sure what's going to come out of my mouth.","Well, I think that when I perform on the road I always thank the audience for buying a ticket because it's a big deal to buy a ticket for a live entertainment, get a baby-sitter and pay for the meal, the parking, whatever.","I love to work. I love doing standup.","Well, Jon Hamm isn't a real celebrity.","My friend Anderson Cooper is the scion of one of America's great shipping and railroad families, the Vanderbilts.","Remember, folks, I am a comedian, not a journalist.","When I'm going to see a comedian, I don't want to see them hold back, and when I'm reading a book, I don't want to hear an abridged version.","I have to tell you, though, the sexism in late night talk is so profound.","I have what I call A-list moments, but believe me, I'm still on the D-list.","Well, the coffeehouse audiences never know what they're going to get, and all the comics are different, as opposed to when you go to a club, and they're pretty much all telling jokes with set-ups and punchlines. Coffeehouse audiences are the most forgiving: They really listen, which is the best part.","I apologize in my real life all the time. I say ridiculous things, I make mistakes constantly. But when I'm on stage, I'm at a microphone... it's a joke!","I have a no-apology policy.","I'll be honest, there's a part of me that does think I'm held to a different standard than my contemporaries and peers, and it's a little frustrating.","I'm not an artist. I tell inappropriate stories and jokes and I try to make people laugh.","I grew up in Chicago and was a huge fan of 'The Second City', so when I moved to L.A., I was looking for anything that resembled that... then I started 'The Groundlings', so I went to a show and it was very much like 'Second City'. I was so impressed that that same night I went backstage and I went up to the funniest person there.","I feel more people can relate to the D-list than the A-list.","I have a no-apology policy. No apologies for jokes. I apologize in my real life all the time. I say ridiculous things, I make mistakes constantly. But when I'm on stage, I'm at a microphone... it's a joke!","To give up my job as a temp and actually make a living doing comedy, it was staggering.","I am an outsider looking in, absolutely. You're not going to see me at the Academy Awards 'Vanity Fair' party any time soon. I'm not somebody who, no matter where I go, there are paparazzi or any of that nonsense. But I have a little window into that world, and I can enter it and dance around. I want to be the audience's ticket into the party.","I constantly say things that I regret. I mortify myself constantly.","I identify with the regular person, because that is who I am.","I'm a female in comedy, so of course I want there to be more women on 'SNL', and women of color."],"Kathy Ireland":["If we get our self-esteem from superficial places, from our popularity, appearance, business success, financial situation, health, any of these, we will be disappointed, because no one can guarantee that we'll have them tomorrow.","There are a lot of good arguments for birth control, but as far as terminating a life that has already come into existence, I haven't found any.","I always knew I belonged on the other side of the lens.","In business it's about people. It's about relationships.","The only thing Martha and I have in common is that we both used to model. Martha Stewart is extremely talented. Her designs are picture perfect. Our philosophy is life is messy, and rather than being afraid of those messes we design products that work the way we live.","I want to be healthy, to be there for my husband and my kids.","We expanded the brand to include a whole line of apparel and accessories, but we quickly learned that it was not good to have one channel of distribution.","Because modeling is lucrative, I'm able to save up and be more particular about the acting roles I take.","Don't just work for the money; that will bring only limited satisfaction.","My family gave me values that have sustained me through situations that would challenge any person. My personal relationship with the Lord inspires me in all I do.","It's been an extraordinary journey. I have learned so much along the way. I entered the modeling industry as a business person already. I always knew I belonged on the other side of the camera.","But I look at failure as education. In that respect, I am so well-educated.","The entire time I was modeling, I was trying and failing at businesses. In fact, we would have started our business much sooner had I been more successful.","I know my strengths. Painfully aware of the weaknesses. There's many. I love sports. So working towards a common goal, that's exciting to me.","I'm a curious person. I like to ask questions.","Beauty comes from the inside.","That was never on my radar, traffic stopping. It was never important to me.","I would say my sense of adventure outweighs my grace.","Martha Stewart is extremely talented. Her designs are picture perfect. Our philosophy is life is messy, and rather than being afraid of those messes we design products that work the way we live.","Our mission began with finding solutions for families, especially busy moms.","When I used to model, the job description is 'shut up and pose.' There are people today who would really like me to go back to that old job description and 'just shut up and pose.'","I intentionally built a business that has absolutely nothing to do with appearance.","I won't give up my day job of design.","I was not making enough time to take care of me.","I like to experiment a lot and invent things.","Jesus was nothing like I thought - He wasn't condemning. He was loving and leading.","I believe there are three keys to success. For me it is keeping my priorities in order: It's my faith and my family, and then the business.","I entered the modeling industry as a business person already. I always knew I belonged on the other side of the camera.","I'm a curious person. I like to ask questions. Well, why? People would say, it's never been done. It's never been done does not mean that it can't be done.","I think I'm too much of a control freak.","An agenda is not a bad thing.","So many young people say, 'I'm just going to see what happens.' It's so much more powerful to make things happen and have a plan.","For me the question was, do I want my paycheck to be dependent on how other people think I look?","I made the intentional choice to step behind the camera."],"Kathy Mattea":["Chocolate's okay, but I prefer a really intense fruit taste. You know when a peach is absolutely perfect... it's sublime. I'd like to capture that and then use it in a dessert.","That's the great paradox of living on this earth, that in the midst of great pain you can have great joy as well. If we didn't have those things we'd just be numb.","Whenever someone leaves, the next person that gets pulled in is somebody with similar values.","When you keep the caliber of musicians very high in the band, people are going to come and go. Some of them will be people who have to try various things, it's natural.","You have to listen to what resonates within your own gut. You find your direction there. Your voice comes out.","So all of these things are going on that make you wake up and realize you are a mortal person. You can choose to cruise through your life, but if you do, you're going to open your eyes at some point, and it's gone.","There's nothing more fun than sitting in a circle playing with people who are really into it.","And in fact, I think the more we start to worship perfection the more soul leaks out of art.","I jump into the process, and the record begins to gel at some point. Then I begin to get a picture of where I'm going. But it's not always something I know on the front-end.","Anyway, our family went into complete crisis mode. I have two older brothers, and we rallied as a family.","I don't live in as much fear as I used to. I'm not afraid of the music business. Life is too damn short. I know what's important, and the tasks are very clear.","If you say that you're all about a certain something, and look back and see that the choices that you've made don't reflect that, then there's something for you to look at.","I've come to understand my role. On some level, I provide the context for them to shine. I also know my role is the steward of the songs, and the center point, the artist that the stuff all revolves around. But I really try to honor that.","I would step into a place of being lined up with a sense of purpose and my inner compass, and everything was going in the same direction. Then I'd get lazy and get off the track. And then things would start to fall apart, and I'd back up and get it together again.","So I really did stop and change what I saw I was about, and really try to put that principle into play as the center of everything - my friendships, my marriage, my career, my family, my way of being in the world. And that changed everything for me.","I guess the biggest thing is that I committed to a spiritual center before I do anything else. And I put some daily things in my life into practice and I maintain that, to make sure that I don't drop the ball.","You know, your speaking voice comes back, but your singing voice you use in a different way.","Or if I have my head in the results, I can't work with what I have, because I'm trying to force something to happen. And with singing, any time you force it, you tighten up. If you tighten up, you're screwed, nothing will work.","So I had to just kind of go back to the hotel, take a shower, sit quiet, dig down deep, warm up, and allow myself to move into some kind of zone. And then I remembered that a lot of my favorite musical moments are not about perfection.","We rob ourselves of so much by focusing on the wrong stuff. And the ability to get into the moment and deal with what is, that's the real opportunity.","I can't even say I've begun yet, but I'm trying on the idea that there is a book in my future.","I really think that's what music and art is about. It's another way to connect to the divine. It's a real pure way of touching that deeper reality beneath our life.","A gourmet meal without a glass of wine just seems tragic to me somehow.","You find yourself in this place where you really get to find out what you're made of, and what I found was that when I was at my time of greatest need, there were people who appeared in my life, and helped me through it.","What is hard to remember when you're in the middle of it is that when you get through to the other side, you always walk away with a gift. If you can stand in there and not walk away from it, you get transformed by it.","Your voice is vibrant for only a certain part of your life. There are some records I've always wanted to make, and I don't know if I want to waste this time beating on the door of the charts.","Can you blame them? We have to filter so much information these days. But it does make it difficult for an artist. I'm 46 years old now. I've had a lot of life experience and my voice has changed. People who expect the same old me are bound to be disappointed.","You have to write badly to write at all. If it's crappy, I will rewrite it later. But it will be mine. You can hear the resonance of an artist who goes into herself."],"Kathy Najimy":["I believe that we all have the potential to love any human being, and that just love who you wish and celebrate it the best you can.","When you're not blond and thin, you come up with a personality real quick.","First and foremost, I'm a feminist. And basically that stems from a strong belief that all people and creatures deserve equal opportunity, rights and respect.","It's a sad day when a cartoon is doing more and cares more and pays more attention to the environment than our president.","I believe that we all have the potential to love any human being, and that genetics, upbringing, choice, social conditioning and environment play a major part in which way we sway.","Love is a gift.","Who'd ever have thought that I'd be the face or the body of any kind of exercise at all.","I've learned that a family can have little glitches without being labeled dysfunctional.","It's really not the genre for me, or the venue, it's the writing.","I recently lost 50 pounds. I'm hovering on the cusp of a size eight, which seems unbelievable.","There was a time when I was 312 pounds. And I've been all different weights.","I just say that at any weight you should love your life.","When I was heavier, I danced and I jumped out of planes. I've always rejected the idea that there's a certain look or size that makes it acceptable to live life.","I'd hesitated to have a wedding because my gay and lesbian friends don't have that right.","I always laugh and say, 'Dudes, if I have to choose, I'm a political person first. I would never do another movie again and be completely happy.' I need to say how I feel.","I'm always for the person who speaks their mind.","It really depends, but, generally speaking, just because of the mechanics of it, voice-over is easier because there is no hair, no makeup, no wardrobe, no fittings, no line memorizing. You don't have to me woken up in Russia at 6 in the morning and go film a scene. It's just easier on the body, the family life to do voice-overs."],"Kathy Reichs":["Bones tell me the story of a person's life - how old they were, what their gender was, their ancestral background.","If you want to be an anthropologist, you need to study physical anthropology specialized in bones. If you want to be a forensic chemist, get a degree in chemistry. Do you want to do DNA work? Get a degree in microbiology. And do well. Study hard and go to graduate school.","At first I probably seem very abrupt, but I like efficiency. There's work and there's play, and I always think: 'Let's get the work over with so we can thoroughly enjoy the play.'","What gives my books authenticity is that I actually do what it is I'm writing about. I think the fact that I am in the autopsy room, I go to the crime scene and I do work in the lab gives my books this flavor that otherwise they wouldn't have.","Murder mysteries are puzzles that are fun to resolve.","I work with the dead, but I am working for the living.","Many fiction writers who put the science in don't get it right.","I tend to watch a lot of movies at home. It's nice to be close to the refrigerator with my pyjamas on and just relax.","My first book was the most successful debut novel in the U.K. ever and every one of my books has reached number one in the U.K. Clearly the British know brilliance when they see it.","I do interviews and signings and readings and all of these people just hang off my every word. And then I go home and have dinner with my family and nobody lets me get a word in.","I originally worked as an archaeologist in North Carolina, and when bones were found police would take them out to the bones lady at the university, and that was me.","I've never lost my capacity to be shocked.","One of the surprising things I hadn't expected when I decided to write crime fiction is how much you are expected to be out in front of the public. Some writers aren't comfortable with that. I don't have a problem with that.","I was a university professor, I could talk on and on and on. Give me a podium and you have to drag me off with a hook.","You'd be naive if you think you are going to retain any control once you option a character to TV.","I'm not writing great literature. I'm writing commercial fiction for people to enjoy the stories and to like the characters.","People love to hate the gravedigger.","I've been accused of being a minimalist writer. I don't like a lot of verbiage in there."],"Kathy Szeliga":["Government has gotten too big, and it's infringed on our liberty and freedom.","The people we send to Washington have to roll up their sleeves, stop the fighting, and work together on issues that are not political, not partisan, but personal to families across our state and our nation.","Don't judge me by what someone posts on my page on Facebook.","I can tell you what women love, and that's when people man-splain things to us about what women want and need.","Too often, we see violent criminals return to the streets they have previously terrorized, only to commit more violent crimes.","When I'm elected to the Senate, I will continue to meet with all Marylanders, whether we agree on every issue or not.","Who's going to do a better job of spending your money? You or the government?","I am who I am, and I'm not going to tell someone I don't have the worldview I have. That doesn't mean I'm not open-minded and won't meet with anybody.","I realized I couldn't raise two kids, coach soccer, be on the PTA, teach full time, and do all the administrative bookkeeping. I do need to sleep four or five hours a day.","That's probably the best part of holding office is being able to solve problems and really help people who feel like no one cares about them.","Of course texting while driving is a terrible idea.","What hinders the middle class the most is taxes, and what hinders business from creating jobs and moving people into the middle class are regulations.","Instead of raising the minimum wage, let's lower taxes for the working poor.","It's a proud tradition we have of a diverse representation from the Maryland congressional delegation.","Governor Hogan's successes and support in Maryland, including with Democrats, prove that Marylanders like the change he's bringing to our state, and they will support a candidate like me who will bring that same real change to Washington.","Women bring a different perspective to the table, and lawmaking is a compilation of diverse ideas and views and perspective. And when you don't have that, you end up making bad laws.","I need a clone. I would like to be everywhere all the time.","I think taxpayers should be outraged that retirees and administrators are walking away with thousands in accrued benefits and bonuses.","Washington would be much better off if it looked more like a state legislature.","I can tell you what people on minimum wage want: They want a career. They don't want a minimum wage.","Nonstop taxes killed the middle class.","I think it is unwise to shut down the government.","As long as I am forbidden to see the MSPAP, my children will be forbidden to take the MSPAP.","My husband and I are small business owners.","I just don't think we're going to change Washington until we put some people down there who look like average Marylanders.","Negotiating with Iran and believing they will keep their word is naive at best.","The Affordable Care Act has turned out to be anything but affordable.","Part of the American dream is 'I can own my own business, I can control my destiny. I can have the opportunity to work for myself.'","I think there's a lot of moms who just aren't feeling protected. And that's one of the prime purposes of the federal government, is the security of our nation.","You have to work across the aisle. Americans have had enough of the gridlock in Washington.","People are unwilling to enforce the laws on the books. Instead, they make more laws. Why can't we get this right?","You don't need a college degree to be a good carpenter, welder, plumber, auto mechanic, member of the armed forces, or firefighter."],"Kathy Valentine":["We only get together when there's a good reason. Like, last summer, we didn't really intend to go out, but we thought the B-52's tour was a good opportunity.","If you have to do it, then you're doing the right thing.","I haven't been approached to do anything, but I would certainly make room for it. It was a really fun time.","The new material fits very comfortably with the older stuff.","I met Rodney when I first moved to LA, so I'd say 20 years. He's the eternal teenager.","I think it's a reflection of the music business in general, which to me seems very fragmented.","Every now and then, a lot of bands doing the same kind of music will organically sprout up at once.","I'm friends with Carla Olsen and she's doing a lot of producing these days. She's getting quite a little collection of records that she's produced. She's real busy.","When we finished the tour we had been writing together for a year. We moved forward from there and have just now finished our record. We're having a new record out in the Spring.","It's kind of like family. I can't say that we go out to lunch and to the movies every day with each other. Everyone's fully grown adult women with lives.","It's very different than it use to be. I think everybody has a lot more experience in how to be in a relationship - whether it's a marriage or a significant other or a business or a friend.","I will be very grateful that I get to go out and play a song and get well paid for it.","The first album is a classic record and I think the prototype of a sound that no one else does.","But the Go-Go's are a very original, kind of organic thing.","Kids need stuff which is different than what their life is that they can kind of live through.","I'm hoping that with the high profile that the Go-Go's are going to have over the next year, that if anybody is interested in what else I do, I'll have something I can say that I do.","Because usually in the past when I was in a big band, that was all I did.","A lot of people don't realize it, but I've a lot less success than I've have had success.","I've struggled just as much as anyone else.","Obviously, the hit singles get the biggest reaction - that's when you can see people really getting excited.","We always have a good time playing, and I'm glad it shows."],"Kati Outinen":["To me, Helsinki is one big movie studio.","Normally, Finns wait for a couple of years and watch Aki's films on television. But it is as though the international reputation of 'The Man Without a Past' caused them to go and see it at the cinema.","You have to remember that Finnish people hate art."],"Katia Winter":["I had a dream, when I was little, to become a police officer and a crime investigator.","I get cast at the last minute. I don't know, maybe somebody drops out and they can't get someone, and someone is like, 'Oh, how about Katia Winter?'","I always like when things are loosely based on real events. That always makes it more interesting because there's a lot of research you can do.","I've done a lot of independent films that not a lot of people have seen.","I love Nike's running shoes and clothes because they feel as light as a feather.","As soon as I get time, I want to start to do some fight training. I tried a little boxing once with my personal trainer back in L.A. - it's such a good workout, and it's a good skill to have, especially in my industry, since sometimes you have to do stunts and fight scenes.","If I had a choice, I love making smoothies, or having some fresh fruit and some good snacks. A smoothie with banana, kale, blueberries and almond milk is so good.","I'm a bit of a chocolate snob, actually, since I used to work at a chocolate shop in England when I was really young. And since then, it's been hard for me to eat cheap chocolate."],"Katie Aselton":["Okay, sense of humor: plus one. Being able to laugh at yourself: plus one. Being able to laugh at other people without being mean: plus one. Vanity: minus one.","It took me a really long time to decide who I want my circle to be and who I want to surround myself with. Once you make that choice, that is where I feel like I have built my strength. This is my life choice. These are the people that make me feel good about me, and that I love and adore and will do anything for.","I love profanity, but I think if it's used too much, it just sounds a little trashy. I think it's more effective when it's dropped intelligently. I like intelligent profanity.","I really want women to throw their shoulders back and stand up straight and use their big girl voices and not feel like they're compromising their femininity to be strong and smart.","I'm not super nostalgic for friendships I've lost along the way. I feel like, if they were truly meaningful and really special, they would still exist. I think we grow and change, and that's okay.","I love my kids, they are amazing children, but they drive me bananas sometimes. And sometimes, I want to sell them on eBay... but I'm not going to.","I think the idea that women can stand up and be strong and still be seen as beautiful and sexual is kind of cool, and I would like to see more of that.","If people want to talk about anything I do, they can give it any name they want. As long as they're talking about it, I think it's great.","I'd like to make mistakes on my own dime and not have a herd of people tell me what I'm doing wrong. and I'm also still trying to find and develop my voice as a filmmaker, and I think that's easier to do on your own terms than trying to satisfy a bunch of people that are paying for the movie.","I don't know what's wrong with me, but like, the second I stop working, I have a panic attack, so it's good for me to be thinking of projects ahead of time and lining things up.","There are very few shows that show women talking like strong, sassy women. Do you know what I mean? 'Sex and the City' started doing that, and that was why that was such a huge hit.","I love sports. I was an athlete in high school, and my school was so small we didn't have a football team, so it's the one sport I didn't bother to learn the rules to because I never went to game.","It's really fun to go back and forth from acting projects to directing projects. You don't have as much responsibility when you're acting, but you have more fun. But then you miss having that responsibility, and so you go back and torture yourself and make a movie.","I really like oysters, and I won't eat them alone. They're just a weird thing to eat by yourself.","I have a very hard time picturing myself in a room with some type of goo oozing out of an air vent and killing me; that doesn't really scare me because I don't think that's going to happen to me.","I think there are certain tenets set in place for all different types on genres. For thrillers, women usually die first. I can't say exactly why, and it's kind of a bummer... But I also can't explain why the wallflower girl in the romantic comedy always gets the guy in the end. That's just the way those movies go.","That one thing you do give up when you get married is that magic moment of meeting someone, and the sparks and the spontaneity.","I think part of what makes someone a great actor is being able to walk into a situation emotionally available and open, and have all your guards down, and just have that level of trust and security in yourself to know that you could walk out on that limb with someone else and be safe.","By the time you are in your thirties, most of the time, you've got a job, you can pay for your rent, you can create this nice world around you. And still, you're only in your thirties - you're not that far away from your twenties, which is when you're making all of your stupid mistakes.","I am a very talented belcher. Very deep and bassy.","I have respect for anyone who's going to go out and make a movie for a small budget and turn it into a phenomenon. God bless you. Please keep making movies. That's great. But it's not what entertains me.","What I get really excited about are movies that I connect with emotionally. 'Deliverance' was on TV, and they don't really make movies like that anymore, just simple and scary. The truly scary thing is, 'I'm going to threaten your life, I'm going to threaten the people you love. What are you going to do about it?'","Part of the process of acting in a film that you're also directing is really trusting the people around you to capture your vision, which hopefully you have communicated well to them.","I would like to get jobs doing other things that aren't necessarily always with my husband. I'd like to show range - and kiss another guy.","I have always had this secret fantasy of being a Bourne girl or Bond girl, and I've never even gotten called in on one of those roles.","It's not rocket science to make a movie.","If the opportunities are not being presented to me, I'm going to take the reins and do it. Brit Marling was not waiting for the phone to ring. The great roles are not there to be had. If you have an idea, do it.","You put three girls in a house, and all of a sudden before you know it, you're talking about boys and drinking whiskey, and things go down and you get deep real quick.","As an actor, you're lucky if you get a month before a project starts. There are times when you get a day before a project starts. So to be able to really sit and inhabit that mind and the story is really beneficial, and it really helps for me to be able to then compartmentalize as we're shooting and detach and go somewhere else.","It took me 30 years to figure out who I really am, as a person, and who I want to surround myself with. I was very much the kind of person who would just meld in with whatever group I was near.","There is something really nice about learning that you can take the reins of your life and your career.","If you're a woman, just make a freaking good movie. I don't believe in the women who say, 'It's too hard, I'm getting shot down.'","I don't love horror movies with something surreal happening. That doesn't work for me. What's terrifying is something that could actually happen to me and what I would do. I don't know how to throw a punch, and I've never had to do it.","I think I'm still trying to find my voice as a filmmaker and finding stories to tell.","I came to filmmaking as an actor looking for great characters and great opportunities, both of which are kind of hard to come by. It turns out I really love the process. And, it's exciting to be able to take my career by the reigns and make things happen for myself. Hopefully, in doing so, more opportunities will become available to me."],"Katie Cassidy":["To me, giving back is so important. It makes others feel good which then in return makes me feel good.","I loved being on stage. I was in elementary school when I started, so I couldn't say that it was about the building of characters.","I try to keep myself in what I'm doing and focused on character stuff, as opposed to getting wrapped up in worrying or being nervous. It won't benefit me, in any way, to focus on that.","I wanted to make a name for myself.","When I was younger, playing piano and guitar were all things that I wanted to do for a short period of time, like any kid.","There is definitely something that has to be said for me liking the action, Lara Croft type stuff. I really want to explore that side of me.","I try mainly to just focus on character and what my character's point of view is, with each person, and try to figure out story.","I was in theater when I was in elementary, middle school and high school. I didn't know it would be an actual profession for me. I didn't think of it as a reality.","I ended up meeting my manager because my sister was a receptionist at a management company. My manager is actually my same manager that I have today. That's how it started. I worked my way.","My hair's been every color. My hair's been all over the map.","I'd like to think I'm actually a nice person in real life.","My style during the day is very casual - boyfriend jeans, T-shirts, Converse, Uggs, whatever. At night, I love heels and thigh-highs, I like something fresh and new, and I'm not afraid to push the envelope.","I love heels... whoever created heels is amazing!","Greg Berlanti, David Nutter, Andrew Kreisberg and Marc Guggenheim are the people I wanted to work with. They're smart, they're funny, they're cool, they're edgy.","I was a freshman and auditioned for the school play. Freshmen usually never got cast. I was the first freshman to be actually given a legitimate part and it was that feeling of 'Wow! I broke the system!'","Attending ComicCon for 'Arrow' was so much fun! Seeing the fans excited gets me excited and feels really good.","I went to New York for Fashion Week and girls showed up waiting to see me. It's funny because there's a group of girls who I actually recognize because they always show up. It's nice and I'm like, 'Hi girls! I recognize your faces!' It's just like a feel-good experience.","It's nice when your dad can be your friend."],"Katie Chang":["I'm very lucky, coming from a great school.","I want to use things I learn about writing in my acting, and vice versa.","My perception of making a movie before I started making movies was that it would be like 'Spy Kids'.","I went to a haunted house once, and I don't do well in situations like that, and I've lived my entire life not being scared or anything.","People probably thought I was scary, but I was just uncomfortable with attention and tended to be a little closed off, except with friends. I learned to embrace the attention.","The first day of 'Bling Ring,' I was so nervous and freaking out. I'm a know-it-all and was going into a situation where I couldn't predict what would happen.","Now I've gotten to know more about the industry. And now that I'm over 18, I can work without my parents on set. That was nice and helped me get comfortable."],"Katie Couric":["You can't please everyone, and you can't make everyone like you.","I think sometimes people project things on you, but I'm trying to handle everything that's happened to me with a certain amount of grace, dignity and good manners. You just can't necessarily win all the time.","I don't know the vast majority of you personally, and it may sound kind of corny, but I really feel as if we've become friends through the years. And you've been with me during a lot of good times and some very difficult ones. I can't tell you how grateful I am.","I've always tried to stay true to my authentic self.","They see us interacting with people, they see us doing serious interviews, they see us having fun, and when you're conversing with someone, you get a much clearer impression of who that person is than if they are just reading into a news piece.","And they like being able to turn on the television day in and day out to see someone that they know and they feel comfortable with and trust hopefully and respect even.","But, you know, they don't enjoy the dinner hour together. It's just not as much of a ritual at night and it's interesting. I think the ritual is taking place perhaps more in the morning.","He would take the blow so you didn't have to.","He was always sort of a scrappy little kid wasn't he? A bit of a fighter?","You see, that's the problem I have with 'you people.'","You know, you've got serious pieces, you've got light pieces, you've got cooking segments, you've got health-related topics, so it's not as if they've had a unique personality from the get-go.","That studies have shown that more people are getting up earlier, they're getting their news earlier. They're getting less sleep, getting up at earlier hours.","Sometimes I think change is a good thing.","So I don't really focus too much on that, and I think it's dangerous if your goal in life is to get the other guy, then you're not going to be doing a really quality job yourself.","Obviously, people in Texas have big hearts.","Now, if they're there to talk about something specifically, and I determine through my own editorial judgment, that another area isn't germane, or isn't an important part of it, that's something else. But we never agree to anything in advance, absolutely not.","I know there's a great deal of speculation, and while I appreciate the interest, kind of, my contract ends in May and I'm trying to figure out what I'm going to do. I'm fortunate to have a couple of opportunities to think long and hard about.","I feel like a human pinata. The disappointing thing is, no candy is going to spill out.","I could announce one morning that the world was going to blow up in three hours and people would be calling in about my hair!","I beg. I call. I badger. I cajole. Part of the secret is everyone has fun and that's really motivating.","But of course when people watch morning television, Terry, it's a very different animal. You know, they're running around, they're getting their kids ready for school, they're probably doing eight million things, they're brushing their teeth.","At least for me personally, I've always tried to do a really good job every day, with each interview, and treat each interview seriously, and make the person I'm speaking with feel comfortable, hopefully make it an ideal experience.","And I've always - the competition is one aspect of the job, but I think if you're too busy worrying about the competition, you don't focus enough on what you're doing.","All three networks have always had a morning show but now cable of course is taking some of that audience away and a variety of other things, probably the Internet as well.","A lot people I know - it drives them crazy when they're watching, to see the people with their signs and waving, but there's something that's very inclusive about it.","If I hear the word 'perky' again, I'll puke."],"Katie Featherston":["I don't spend a lot of time thinking about scary demons, but I think that there are things in this world that are unexplainable that are mystical or paranormal. The possibility is there, definitely.","I can not watch either of the 'Paranormal' films alone.","I've had some people tell me they're glad I'm a normal girl. Of course I'm a normal girl!","I think fear of the unknown is the scariest thing.","What I really want to do is comedy. I would love to do some guest star spots on some single-camera comedies.","I loved scary movies growing up.","I have friends that I have made through Twitter or things like that, but they're all verified as real people - I've either seen them perform, or we're mutual fans of each other, something like that. I don't have any authentic, 'Catfish'-worthy stories.","I'm at that great level where fans will stop and say 'hi,' which I love, but the paparazzi don't care, which is incredible.","I loved growing up and going to haunted houses and being scared. I loved watching 'The Exorcist,' 'Candyman' and all sorts of scary movies.","I have plenty of dream roles because there is so much I want to do, but my dream year would be to be in a single-camera comedy and then, on my hiatus, film a little low-budget indie drama. That would be a dream 12-month period. A dream role depends on having good material and working with people that I can learn from.","I've twice accidentally stolen something, and both times I went back and paid for them when I realized I had done it."],"Katie Findlay":["At age 10, I was better at ballet than I think I will ever be at any physical activity for the rest of my life.","I'm a wall to wall geek. I love sci fi; I've had a crush on Spider-Man since I was five years old, and there's an uncomfortably large shelf in my living room just for my comics.","I love biographies. I'm especially into stuff about Hollywood in the '40s and '50s. I find it fascinating and terrifying.","I don't know how to exist before 9 A.M. And without coffee, I'm not classified as a human. Actually, I could be regarded as a threat."],"Katie Finneran":["I love singing and I think I have a really nice voice, but I don't think I have an unbelievable singing voice. I think I have a great character voice.","I know how to tell a story to a thousand people. Sometimes I don't know how to tell a story to a piece of tape on a wall and a camera.","You can go to the Internet and know more than your mom in two seconds. It's crazy how fast teenagers have knowledge and information these days. So, I think it's harder to say, 'Your father and I know more than you.'","I really feel that the thing that I love the most about my career is that it is so eclectic. You know, I've gone from so many genres and so many different mediums and I love that most - that people have always given me the chance to do vastly different things.","I love characters songs and I love to fit into a story. I love singing through a character's journey.","I would love to go back to Broadway.","I don't feel like I need a break from the theater, ever.","I love the theater so much, and it's where I feel most comfortable. I love the people and the community.","My two favorite musicals growing up in were 'Annie' and 'Sweeney Todd,' and my best friend and I would sing all the songs when I was a kid."],"Katie Hafner":["When Rose McDermott, a professor of political science at Brown University, got divorced two years ago, she noticed that a cluster of her friends were splitting up at around the same time.","McDermott and two colleagues - James H. Fowler of the University of California, San Diego, and Nicholas A. Christakis of Harvard University - published a paper titled 'Breaking Up is Hard to Do, Unless Everyone Else is Doing it Too.' Their study shows that divorce can spread like a virus among friends, siblings and co-workers.","Speaking as the child of divorce, I have to say that one of the most disconcerting findings in 'The Longevity Project' focused on divorce: On average, grown children of divorced parents died almost five years earlier than children from intact families.","In 1990, Howard Friedman and Leslie Martin, two psychologists at the University of California, Riverside, embarked on a research project within a research project, seeking answers to the question, 'What makes for a long life?'","'Blue Valentine,' Derek Cianfrance's emotional gunslinger of a film, tears into the topic of moribund marriages with an honesty that's hard to come by in Hollywood these days.","It took Cianfrance 12 years to bring 'Blue Valentine' to the screen after he first conceived it. He found Gosling and Williams early on, and they hung in there with him. The film finally premiered at Sundance 2010, then screened at Cannes and the Toronto Film Festival before landing in theaters in December.","Divorce, and broken marriages, are all around us, but they're not frequently depicted on screen, or if they are, they're often depicted in ways that have very little to do with reality.","Like the protagonist of her 2006 novel, 'Love and Other Impossible Pursuits,' Ayelet Waldman is a Jewish redhead who attended Harvard Law School and is madly in love with her husband. But the obvious similarities end there.","Stacey Napp understands the ugly side of divorce - which is often the side that involves money. In fact, she understands it so well that in 2008 she started a business, Balance Point Divorce Funding, which invests in divorce and probate litigation, helping clients cover costs in exchange for a share of the winnings.","In 2002, my husband died very suddenly. My main concern that day was how to deliver the news to our daughter, then eight. Someone put me in touch with Judith Wallerstein, an expert in child psychology who coached me through what to say.","'Unexpected Legacy' reports the findings of the California Children of Divorce Study, which began in 1971, a year after the nation's first no-fault divorce law was imposed in California. Wallerstein was the principal investigator on the study.","In the summer of 2009, in the wake of a crisis in her life, my mother moved from San Diego to San Francisco to live with my 16-year-old daughter and me. My mother was 77. I was 51. Despite a chorus of skepticism from friends - who knew about my upbringing - I was determined to do what I could to help my mother.","Having a parent live with you under the best of circumstances can be a terrible stressor.","Being a journalist, you write what you see. If we can't do that, what use are we? I turned years of training on myself.","Unlike most divorced parents, whose interactions are confined to the topic of the kids, people still sharing a house have to talk about clogged sinks and moth infestations.","Dr. Esserman, who directs the Carol Franc Buck Breast Care Center, is one of only a few surgeons in the United States willing to put women with D.C.I.S. on active surveillance instead of performing biopsies, lumpectomies or mastectomies.","In 1981, while doing postdoctoral field work in cultural anthropology, Bonnie A. Nardi lived with villagers in Western Samoa, trying to understand the cultural reasons that people there have an average of eight children.","No longer do companies study consumers' psyches only by asking people what they think about technology and how they use it. Now they conduct observational research, dispatching anthropologists to employ their ethnographic skills by interviewing, watching and videotaping consumers in their natural habitats.","Sometimes an ethnographic inquiry will lead to new ways to use an existing technology or will generate new technologies.","Many anthropologists work with a concept called embodied knowledge - tacit, nonscientific knowledge - and look for ways to incorporate such information into product design.","Spurred by the unlimited texting plans offered by carriers like AT&T Mobility and Verizon Wireless, American teenagers sent and received an average of 2,272 text messages per month in the fourth quarter of 2008, according to the Nielsen Company - almost 80 messages a day, more than double the average of a year earlier.","Tim Berners-Lee, the 44-year-old English physicist who created the World Wide Web, is precisely the kind of hero that a relatively simple invention with profound social and economic consequences should lay claim to. He is not just creative but democratic, diplomatic, polite and generous with credit and praise.","Berners-Lee started the World Wide Web as a set of protocols for transferring, linking and addressing documents to send over the Net. Without the global reach and open technical standards of the Internet, the Web could never have proliferated as it did.","The story of the Web starts in 1980, when Berners-Lee, a young consulting physicist at the CERN physics laboratory near Geneva, grew frustrated with existing methods for finding and transferring information.","Using the HTTP protocol, computer scientists around the world began making the Internet easier to navigate by inventing point-and-click browsers. One browser in particular, called Mosaic, created in 1993 at the University of Illinois, would help popularize the Web, and therefore the Net, as no software tool had yet done."],"Katie Hoff":["To break the mark definitely showed me I'm on the right track.","I like underwater pole vaulting, because you can have perfect form without the risk.","Things definitely got out of perspective.","I can just put my head down and train hard.","The last few years haven't been as good so I can fly under the radar, come in and do the best I can and I don't have all these high hopes placed on me.","I'm more relaxed and just feel like there's kind of a peace with myself.","I'm not saying I didn't have a great 2008. I just made it a chore. I made it look laborious.","I'm just going to go out there and do my best.","My boyfriend is not a swimmer!","If I could compete at home, and never leave Rochester, I'd be in perfect condition.","I feel like I'm more of the underdog, which is kind of nice.","When I look back, I'm definitely proud of what I did. It kind of allows me to move forward and reset my goals."],"Katie Holmes":["It's kind of fun being the cute, little one. In fact, I'm finding it hard to grow out of that.","I'm so spoiled - I must have a Starbucks vanilla latte every day.","We all keep dreaming, and luckily, dreams come true.","I'm definitely a messy person... I know where everything is but I just can't organize. I don't make lists and find scripts on the laundry machine, and under my bed, or in the bathroom, kitchen. It's bad, I really need to take control.","I got caught kissing. Like by my parents. It was so horrible. It's so embarrassing, I'm blushing.","I'm not computer literate. I e-mail. I know how to get on the Web, but I haven't crossed over into the internet world. I'm old-fashioned, I guess.","I have some road rage inside of me. Traffic, especially in L.A., is a pet peeve of mine.","He's the most incredible man. He's so generous and kind, and he helps so many people, and, um, he makes me laugh like I've never laughed, and he's a great friend.","Tom and I will always be in our honeymoon phase.","Chris and I care about each other and we're still friends. Tom is the most incredible man in the world.","We had such a wonderful set of circumstances in Wilmington. Yes, the four of us became famous literally overnight, but we were in a small town and we always knew when people were coming down. We always knew when to behave.","I wasn't very funny or flashy, I was kind of boring.","Any time I break up with Dawson or question him, viewers turn against me.","It's actually great to shoot far away from Hollywood because we don't have the distractions of the parties and premieres and all that. And, of course, you can save money - there are no good shoe stores.","We have our little restaurants, and there's a beautiful beach that we go to in the summer and fall. We tend to have a lot of get-togethers, and if it's at my house, we order pizza because I can't cook.","I'm not strictly vegetarian, but meat doesn't play a big part in my diet.","I did Phone Booth, and that was shot very, very quickly, but that was Joel Schumacher, who's shot so many movies that, if anybody can figure out how to do it in a couple of days, it's him.","I love all of his movies. I love all his movies. I love Tom.","Fortunately we've been shooting in North Carolina which means we're not in LA where you can hear people talking about you and you know so much about what's going on in the business.","In North Carolina nobody bothers us; we're all about concentrating on the work or our auditions that we're trying to get a flight out for. So all that crap is not something that I'm confronted with on a daily basis.","I think I want to pursue a movie career and maybe even pursue some theatre.","I'm not the easiest person to live with. I'm kind of a slob.","I found it to be more challenging to be in a huge effects movie, because a lot of the things aren't there. You have to trust the director and react to nothing.","I feel so blessed to do what I do, but there's nothing in the world better than watching your child succeed.","This business is so unstable, and you never really know where you're going to be.","I don't always take off my make-up before bed, and I like pizza at two in the morning.","I work very hard, but I also really enjoy time with my family as well. So I take everything as it comes, but I really am very selfish about my family time.","As a teenager, skincare is about putting no oil on your skin because you don't want any blemishes, and then in your thirties, you're putting as much oil as it can take to avoid wrinkles!","I like doing yoga; I like running and cycling - just staying active. And I love a facial.","I went with a pixie cut when my daughter was really young. It was easy - I mean, it was really easy. But I missed my long hair. Especially after a long winter, all I want is sexy summer hair.","I'll do my makeup in the car sometimes.","My schedule is pretty busy, so I've learned to do my makeup quickly because I prefer to sleep.","When I was a little girl - if I could have - I would have gone a year without washing my hair. I hated it, to the point where my sisters had to pay me to wash my hair. I think, after experiencing that, I like to wash it every day.","With age, I've gained confidence.","I still feel like a girl. I don't quite feel like a woman. I'll probably be 90 and feel like, 'Not a woman yet!'","Growing up, I always had my dreams set on being an actor, so I looked up to Julia Roberts, Audrey Hepburn.","Becoming a mother has been the most amazing experience - in an instant, you become strong. You have to be a little bit wiser; it's the most important job in the world.","When 'Top Gun' came out, my sisters were like, 'Oh, my God, 'Top Gun!' Tom Cruise!' And I very confidently said, 'I'm going to marry him one day.' It wasn't like, 'How do I get to Tom Cruise?' It was just, 'I think I'm going to marry him. Why not? He'll like me. I'm fun.'","Definitely trust yourself. Work hard. Be honest with yourself. And life can be joyful. It is joyful. Just give it your all, and it's all going to work out.","I just look for characters I can relate to.","I have three sisters. I went to an all-girls academy.","I went to a local modeling school when I was about 10 and learned to walk the runway.","I do like to buy my own clothes because I like to support designers. I know the work that goes into it.","I have a tightly edited closet. I like what I like. And I repeat a lot. But I'm always comfortable in jeans - I feel like I can really do anything when I'm in them.","When I became a mother, my life completely changed.","I'm learning every day, and I have been since the minute I became a mom.","I don't over-gift. I don't inundate my child with a lot of things.","We're trying to raise good humans, and some days, we're better at it than others. You don't always get treats."],"Katie Jacobs Stanton":["The more up-to-date the information, the more valuable it is.","Twitter didn't make up the hashtag. Twitter didn't make up the retweet. It's our users. And people started using them so much that we decided to weave them into the product. I can't think of another company that has taken its users' actions and said, 'We're going to make them useful to everybody.'","I spent one semester in Air Force ROTC, as I wanted to be a pilot."],"Katie Kitamura":["One thing about having children is that even as it complicates many aspects of your life, it simplifies others.","I'm not one to probe my limitations.","The alchemy of a fight card is a mysterious thing. Even the most meticulous matchmaking can sometimes misfire.","Modern sport can be an ugly convergence of commerce and celebrity, but it still has the capacity to move a crowd.","It's difficult to identify why two cultures will react differently to the same sport.","I was introduced to fighting by my brother - he's a tattooer, a tough guy - and I completely fell in love with it. I was watching fights on YouTube all the time. I would go to parties to watch UFC fights.","There's something about being a woman and being able to dress up in men's clothing, so to speak.","In a fight, you don't need much context for drama. You watch a fight, and that's it.","It took me a long time to accept that I was a writer.","I never listen to music when I write. It's too much of a distraction.","It's hard, but I try not to think of happiness as either pending or in the past.","I think it's poignant and powerful, this idea that if someone knows your name, they have the ability to kind of hail you and make demands upon you.","I think there's such a fine line in a relationship. The role of imagination and privacy... how much space can you allow before that becomes distance? And similarly, imagination is empathy. That's how you achieve empathy. It's how you can be with another person and understand how they are in the world.","I am generally wary of the demand for 'likeability' in fiction, which I think is a bastardisation of the demand of identification - itself something of a suspect notion.","There should be characters and situations that we cannot identify with, that retain either too much horror or too much wonder to allow for simple identification. That feels to me like an accurate depiction of what it is like to be in the world, rather than a neutered register of continual empathy.","The canon is dominated by books written by men, about men, and for men - the male voice is therefore not a particularly difficult one to impersonate.","There's a long relationship between science fiction and the 'novel of ideas,' and I think writers of science fiction are able to draw on that tradition to take risks, to constantly raise the level of their ambition.","The idea of physical strain and discipline, the question of how and when you leave that life behind - they're things I'm familiar with on one level or another.","I pretty much admire anybody who has the discipline and the will to make a career out of fighting. It takes buckets of nerve.","The first fight I saw live, the fighter I was shadowing lost in front of a crowd of forty thousand people. The scale of that is staggering to me. Undergoing that overlap between something very personal and something very public strikes me as both admirable and also somewhat terrifying.","People remain unknowable to us, even people that we're very close to. And I think the same goes for our own selves.","We act in ways that are mysterious to ourselves.","For about as long as I've been writing fiction, I've kept a record of the books I've read.","Generally speaking, there's some quality of compulsion that attaches itself to the idea of the list. It's true that lists organise the daily chaos of working life. But the impulse to make lists has to do with something more than either administrative practicalities or the record of a creative process.","How do we describe the fact of human existence? At a certain point, perhaps, style fails us. Language, even and in particular at its most evocative, becomes less of an aid and more of a difficulty.","From their breakout 2002 single, 'Losing My Edge,' LCD Soundsystem have offered a unique combination of geek knowledge, passion and intelligent, ironic distance.","'Losing My Edge' was an anthem for the aging music nerd, with lyrics detailing a comically epic list of historical dates, bands and attended gigs: the anti-hipster's defence against 'the art-school Brooklynites in little jackets and borrowed nostalgia for the unremembered Eighties.'","I'm always interested in a character who does something and doesn't understand why they've done it.","I like a lot of Spanish language writers. I really love Javier Marias.","As a writer, I think the greatest danger would be self-censorship."],"Katie Leclerc":["In the deaf community, in order to play a role of someone with a hearing loss... you have to have hearing loss.","I have a condition called Menieres disease which is a problem with fluid retention in the inner ear. It has four symptoms: ringing in the ear, pressure in the ear, fluctuating hearing loss, and attacks of vertigo.","I was born in San Antonio, TX, but moved to Lakewood, CO in elementary school. Then, I moved to Valley Center, CA in high school.","I got my first job when I moved to Los Angeles. I worked at a coffee shop for five years and it was one of the best experiences I ever had. It was a bunch of actors covering shifts for each other and becoming great friends.","My junior year, I was in a play at school and five days before opening night, I still didn't know my lines. Opening night was a disaster. I was so embarrassed. The director made me work backstage for the rest of the performance.","When I played 'Annie' in the seventh grade, I knew from then on that I wanted to be an actor.","In my normal life, I do not speak with an accent. It's harder for people to realize my hearing loss in everyday life.","I'm a total nerd. I love comic books and video games and most of all zombies!","It's really important to be active in your community, whatever community that is... find allies and find people who you relate to and who make you stronger as a group.","I wasn't sold on 3-D until it was in my own home. The images jump out at you, even more so than in the theater, because you're in tighter quarters and you're closer to the TV, so it feels like the depth is very dramatic.","The iPad was my first splurge after I got my first paychecks. I paid off the debt, and I now bring the iPad with me to auditions."],"Katie Ledecky":["I would encourage you to set really high goals. Set goals that, when you set them, you think they're impossible. But then every day you can work towards them, and anything is possible, so keep working hard and follow your dreams.","I try to make the good days great and take something positive from the days I'm not feeling good - work on technique or something like that.","When I was six, right before I started swimming, we went to a national competition here in Maryland and watched Michael Phelps swim, and I got to meet him afterwards, and I got his autograph. Fast forward nine years, and I'm at the Olympics with him, and it's like: 'Woah.'","My faith has always been important to me. It defines who I am.","It's always great to see young swimmers and their excitement and the joy that they have in the water.","After the 2013 World Championships, I had three goals for the Olympics: to swim 3:56 or better in the 400-meter freestyle, break 8:05 in the 800, and win gold in the 200. I achieved all of those, and soon, it will be time to set some new goals.","I'm just maintaining the same mindset that I had going into the 2012 Olympics and Olympic trials, which is just, whatever happens, happens.","I think our devotion to Mary is very beautiful. She has a sacred role in Catholicism, and her strong faith and humility are things we can learn from.","I think the beauty of Catholicism is its consistency through both successes and difficulties. I've counted on my faith to give me strength through both training and competition - but also in school, with my family and everyday life.","It's kind of a loping stroke. It's not the prettiest stroke. But it's what's most efficient for me. And I think I kick a little more than most swimmers do.","I felt so relaxed. It just felt very easy, and that's why it surprised me that I had broken my world record.","I think we have the approach that every race is a sprint. Some races are just longer sprints than others.","More than anything, praying just helps me to concentrate and let go of things that don't matter in that moment. It gives me peace knowing I'm in good hands.","There are a lot of young swimming fans that are on Instagram, so I try to respond or post things that they like."],"Katie Leung":["I am very indecisive. I'm always afraid of making the wrong decision.","I thought acting was all about natural instinct but I've realised, through working with so many talented actors on 'Wild Swans' and 'Run,' that I can see the training. That's why I am back at drama school.","I'm not the type of person who enjoys the limelight.","I was born in Scotland and have lived there all my life. I speak conversational Cantonese with my dad when I'm at home, and very basic Mandarin.","I'm very quiet. I can go a whole week without talking, so doing interviews is really awkward for me!","One of the things I liked about my character in 'Run' is that she can just disappear into the background if she wants, which is what I'm like.","I love theatre. It's far more satisfying than film. Sometimes there's a collective sigh from the audience, or it's so quiet you can hear a pin drop. I couldn't believe how easy acting was when there's an audience; after a few previews I almost couldn't do it without one.","'Wild Swans' showed me there are Chinese traditions that still affect my life. For example, it's not that women are inferior, exactly, but my dad and my brother are the most important men in my life and I would do anything for them. I feel like I should be the one cooking and looking after them.","In general, the auditions I go up for are very sparse, I guess because of my ethnicity. And the characters are very similar: shy, innocent and naive; the connotations that come from the way that I look.","I'm single and looking and failing miserably. I'm keeping my options open.","I like Joaquin Phoenix. He's an amazing actor and he's so buff."],"Katie Lowes":["When I start my mornings, I put some essential oils in a diffuser; it might be orange blossom or jasmine to energize and spruce me up or lavender at night to really calm me down.","In high school, I had a couple girlfriends who had very extreme eating disorders. Anorexia and bulimia. And in college as well. It's just heartbreaking. As someone going through it, it's heartbreaking. And as a friend who's helping a friend going through it, it's heartbreaking. It's a real, real disease.","Kerry Washington is a mentor to me. She is so strong and smart. She's also so giving and supportive.","I'm a New Yorker, so I speak really fast, naturally.","I think it's important to find humor anywhere you can. In real life, with the darkest, scariest, most intense moments, if you can find something funny, that's good.","If you can find a group of women, any age, who are supportive and kind and love you, that's the best. I have a group of girlfriends that I would lay in front of a bus for. They've picked me up through really, really bad times and I can definitely say I've done the same for them.","Everybody has parts of themselves that they're not 100% happy with - that's what makes you human. And being an actor, your job is to play human beings. Your job is to play real people.","I think that there is something truly beautiful in everybody you meet.","I look so fondly back on that time in my life when you first got an agent and you were in your mid-twenties and the world was your oyster.","'Scandal' has been, for me, the most consistent time I've ever logged in front of a camera. I grew up in the theater, and I feel very confident and comfortable on the stage and in front of a live audience, but the camera is a very different medium.","To have an opportunity to get in front of a camera every single day is just priceless because it gets you closer and closer to being less self-consciousness in front of it and really being human and really making choices and standing by them.","I went to NYU Tisch for undergrad, and it was amazing. My life then was extremely experimental with acting. I did crazy theater where we would be rolling around on the floor. I would be playing grandmothers, and clowns, and all this crazy stuff. Then I would be doing Shakespeare eight hours a day.","I love singing! I was a musical theater girl in high school. We were always singing and dancing around, and just doing little community theaters and high school musicals. Then, when I got to NYU, I focused more on drama.","Acting is a growing tick muscle. I really believe that it's similar to being a musician in that the more you practice it in any capacity, as much as you practice doing it every day, the better you get.","I think it's just important to be always bouncing between TV and theater, and hopefully I'll get to do movies at some point.","I'm big on yoga and of taking care of my mental health.","I do Hatha yoga at Yogaworks three times a week and do two hikes a week.","I run into so many people who also have psoriasis and share the same feelings as I had. I tell them that it's about being your own boss and of not settling until they find whatever it is that works for them and they have their life look the way they want it to.","I got 'Scandal,' and that was, far and away, the biggest deal that had happened in my career. Simultaneously, the stress from planning my wedding and being in the public eye for the first time, combined with genetics - I got the diagnosis that I had psoriasis, and I was completely embarrassed and ashamed. I felt like a lesser person.","After having a real baby, I was sitting on a doughnut for a month.","This whole thing of motherhood is insane.","It's just heaven to be a mom, and a working mom, and a pregnant person in Shondaland.","My husband and I are both actors; we're obviously dramatic.","I wanted a doula because it's my first baby, and I want to be able to call her when I'm going into labor so she can come over and help us go through the early stage.","I was a wedding planner's assistant for years. And I knew I did not want to have a traditional wedding because I had worked a million of them. So my husband and I got married at a sleepaway camp in the Berkshires.","I love to walk in the door of my home and love what I see.","As somebody who has psoriasis, it's your job to constantly stay on top of these things: talking to your doctor and talking to your doctor and just being proactive about your specific case.","When I have any sort of diet that's high in sugar or yeast, I would find that my body would be very much out of whack.","A lot of times, I put my own personal health to the side, focusing on work or family or getting ahead. At the end of the day, you're just exhausted on your couch and haven't made that doctor's appointment, didn't make that phone call, and feel terrible.","Until you get pregnant, you never know about baby brands and baby furniture, but it's actually a choice. And Oeuf is a very affordable company, and everything is organic - chemically free, sustainable. It's all beautifully made and can also transition from babies to toddlers. Everything has conversion kits, so it's practicable.","I am a type-A planner. That's just how I roll.","For me, having a baby was never going to be timed randomly. I wanted to have mine while I was on 'Scandal.' Kerry Washington is one of my best friends, and I've gotten to watch her go through motherhood. I also have the greatest female boss in Shonda Rhimes, who is a mother of three and a huge advocate for women.","I feel so honored to be a mom and get to do something that women have done for thousands of years.","Being a new mommy really is the best.","I can't even remember anything before Albee. There is this bursting love you feel, but it's so intense and so all-consuming. I've become one of those psychopath mothers who loves looking at my kid and being with my kid, and then, when he takes a nap, I'm just looking at videos and pictures of him on my phone. I'm obnoxious.","I don't know if it's because of 'Scandal,' but I am a huge wine and popcorn fan.","There's nothing better than renting a small, 50-seat theater in L.A. and just getting up there.","There's something about getting onstage in a play where the actor tells the story, beginning, middle, and end, the way they want to tell it. For me, it's the most powerful place to be, and it's the most empowering place to be."],"Katie McGinty":["We need to put a priority on environment, health, and safety protections.","At a time when families are incredibly squeezed, it's essential that we provide a living wage for people who work hard and that women realize equal pay for the work they're doing.","People, including business leaders, are willing to be open-minded about investment dollars when they know where they are going - and what purpose they are going to be dedicated - as opposed to just going into the black abyss of the general fund.","You have to get out there and compete. You have to work hard. People aren't just going to come knocking on your door and say, 'Please let me invest $1 billion in your back yard.' You need to be able to go and match the pitch and close the deal.","Our family story here is one that we're proud of, and that is that, as the ninth of 10 kids in our family, I was the first who, right out of high school, was able to go to four-year college... it was a big moment in our family's life.","Pennsylvania has some of the best science in the world.","States like Massachusetts and New York are working aggressively to keep and grow life sciences companies.","I don't support a moratorium. I think the responsible production and use of the Marcellus Shale gas is actually part of the secret sauce as to how we will create jobs and how we will compete and win.","We know how to build cross-disciplinary teams that are needed to take good ideas and make them great businesses. We're good at nurturing that kind of environment. And I do think that's something that's increasingly recognized in a lot of sectors in the economy.","I think the governor has short-changed the people of Pennsylvania with respect to shale gas, both with respect to the environment and the economy.","As governor, I will work to ensure the Department of Environmental Protection issues the Climate Action Plan and will seek to implement the plan's recommendations.","The portfolio standard was enacted when I was secretary of the Department of Environmental Protection. It created investment, generated jobs, and gave a boost to local economies, all when helping to protect the environment.","I had the good fortune to win a congressional fellowship to work on what I felt passionately about - the need for the United States to take back jobs related to manufacturing and technology.","I've had surprises on the campaign trail that have both been just absolutely inspiring and affirming of the great values of the people of this country, and I've had some experiences that are disappointing and troubling.","Women need to double and triple men to demonstrate their experience and qualifications.","Pat Toomey has worked to allow suspected terrorists to buy guns in this country, and that is just an outrageous position. Of all the kind of tough issues, this one should not be a tough call.","I know this: Secretary Clinton will fight for working families, and that's what I'm going to do as well.","Let's be clear: Donald Trump is a lewd, lecherous lowlife.","I very happily stand for the right of every man and woman in Pennsylvania to have their voice heard in elections. And when they do have their voice heard, it's nothing short of a privilege to welcome and respect that voice because this is a democracy, and that's what we do.","As a mom, I'm going to be out there still fighting to make sure that every beautiful child has good schools, same communities, and a chance to succeed because God has given everybody unique gifts.","This country is based on a simple bargain, and that bargain is if you work hard, you get to get ahead.","I want to be part of making sure that decent, honorable, humble, hardworking people in Pennsylvania can look their kids in the eyes. And when they put in their 40 hours, they can say to their kids, 'I got you.'"],"Katie McGrath":["Maybe people don't see me as believable playing a person of today. I guess I'm just more realistic in a corset and funny hairstyles.","I love being as bad as possible! You've got to love a bad girl. Look at 'Gone With the Wind,' Scarlett O'Hara - total bad girl, but you love her.","I wear a lot of black, knitwear, skinny jeans and very high heels. My mum used to work for a fashion designer making knitwear, so she knits me lots of chunky scarves, hats and gloves, which I love.","If I could have picked an era to have lived, I think I would've loved to have been one of Louis XIV's mistresses. They were so fantastic and aristocratic, and they had so much power. And he was such a renaissance man. I think I would've fit into that nicely.","No actor can play a villain if they don't sympathise with him or her - otherwise the character just becomes a two-dimensional caricature.","One day I'd love a house in the country, with some chickens, dogs and kids.","I do keep getting these bad girl roles. The funny thing is that, honestly, I don't think I'm believable as these aristocratic mean girls. But I do love playing them.","I don't get recognized in England. Not at all. Every so often, I get recognized in other countries.","I get sent lots of jewellery by fans, and that's absolutely lovely.","It's not an understatement to say that I owe everything as an actor to 'Merlin.' It was pretty much my first job, and I didn't know what I was doing for many years on it. It wasn't until the third and fourth series - the fourth series especially - that I really found my feet with the character, and as an actress.","I grew up in a small town in Ireland and didn't know any actors. I never thought it was a viable job. It wasn't until I was on 'The Tudors' that I realised it was a possibility.","My friend once sculpted me a bust of Admiral Ackbar from 'Star Wars.' He's my favourite character in the films after Han Solo. He's that goldfish-type alien in the white costume. 'It's a trap!' I'm a big geek.","I wasn't born an actress, but I was certainly born dramatic!","I had this vague notion that one day I might be editor of 'Vogue China.' It was a bizarre ambition, as I didn't speak a word of Chinese. There were flaws in my plan, admittedly.","I am really terrible when it comes to guys. Inside, I just see myself as this overweight tomboy with funny-coloured hair and bad skin.","I can't watch most of my work. Once I come on screen, all I can think of is 'What am I doing with my hands?' or 'Why did I lean that way?' or 'What's that look on my face?' It's too difficult to not focus on evaluating my acting.","Without Merlin, there would be no Gandalf, so I see them as the same thing, one a continuation of the other.","I loved every minute of working in wardrobe. But I love being an actress so much more. I don't think I was very good in costume, so it's better that I prefer being an actress.","Working crew made me realise that the actors are a very small part of a very big machine, with each part being vital to make the show work. It so important to remember that it's not about you, it's about the show, and working crew hammered that point home to me.","I'm a very ambitious girl. I'll go wherever there is a good part.","My mum's amazing - every time I achieve something in my career, she buys me a diamond earring.","I'm not a high-maintenance person.","I spend a lot of time on eBay buying vintage. I also really like Alexander Wang, Miu Miu, Vivienne Westwood, McQueen and Balmain."],"Katie Nolan":["You are not just a funny person or just a journalist. Most people are hybrids of having a smart opinion and a great sense of humor.","I love meeting new people.","My first sales assessment, they tell you your strong points, and they told me I was the emotional salesman, the one who could really connect with people by making them feel comfortable. Once someone told me that, I couldn't get past how manipulative it made me feel.","I try to limit my time with Michael Davies to as little as possible per week, and he is pretty good with that, since he has a bazillion things to do. When I do see him, I try not to talk about dental work or anything like that because I know the Brits get very sensitive.","I am not going to say I have never spoken with Bill Simmons because I have. I respect him greatly.","When I review my contract, it is to make sure that I am not going to get in trouble or not paid. Then afterward, people say, 'Did you make sure they gave you a green room,' and I'm like, 'No, I didn't get any of the cool stuff.'","I think the vision for FOX is to have a network full of people who have opinions as opposed to people who say news. If my message doesn't fit in, but I get that platform, then I'm reaching the people who most need to hear it.","'Garbage Time' was the name I came up with. Midnight was my decision. Were they the right decisions? I dunno.","I have no other network to compare it to, but FOX has treated me lovely.","I wanted to go to school for public relations, and I also wanted to minor in dance. And Hofstra had two really good programs for both of those, so that's why I ended up there.","I'm sure you're used to hearing that when people get to Long Island for the first time, it's a bit of a shock to the system. But I found Long Island people very endearing.","There are a lot of interesting differences between Boston and New York in general, and I think they're sort of heightened in Long Island.","It's an interesting dynamic living in New York in general as a Boston fan. It's kind of fun that way. It's fun to be the contrarian when everyone hates you as long as your team is winning.","I make funny videos. I hate saying I'm a comedian because then people stick their finger in your face and demand you tell a joke. But the other thing people call me is 'a YouTube sensation,' which is even worse.","I was bartending in Boston five, six nights a week, living in my grandmother's condo. By the way, I'm a really good bartender - that's the only skill I can confidently say I have.","'Guyism' wanted a daily video series. They told me they were planning on hiring a girl and then hiring someone to write all her jokes. Then they figured it would be easier just to get me, so they offered me $750 a month to do it, which turned into an offer to move to New York and do it full-time for $30,000 a year.","My grandmother is 82, and some days she doesn't even put her teeth in.","It is very easy to try to type cosmopolitan.com and accidentally type foxsports.com, if you just got your nails done.","I went by Kyle, and I made friends on the team as Kyle. It went on for a pretty long time, until I went to a birthday party in a dress and all the hockey players were like... 'Kyle?'","I miss Boston so much and want to get back there someday.","My dad likes to tease me over this. We weren't there at Fenway, and it wasn't a consequential game, but Trot Nixon let a ball go through his legs, and from that moment on, I hated Trot Nixon. Really irrational. Based in nothing. But did not like him.","I'd get home at 3:30 A.M. from the bar after my shift ended at 1. I'd write jokes, film it, and then sleep. So I did that for two years.","Not every woman goes to sporting events to find men, but 2-3 percent of women do.","People are confused when you work for a national sports outlet and they've never seen you on a local affiliate.","I make sort-of funny videos for the Internet that are watched by a handful of people.","Women in sports television are allowed to read headlines, patrols sidelines, and generally facilitate conversation for their male colleagues. Sometimes, they even let us monitor the Internet from a couch.","A lot of people like to justify women's supporting role in sports media by saying, 'Well, they've never played the game, so they just aren't qualified to speak about it.'","The truth is, the NFL will never respect women and their opinions as long as the media it answers to doesn't. I'm ready when you are, Fox.","Don't let... anybody in the Cowboys organization fool you into thinking they support Greg Hardy. They don't. They support sacks.","I was like, 'I want to start a blog to get my ideas out and keep my brain working so in five years I'm not an idiot.'","Garbage time is that time at the end of the game when the points don't really matter, and nothing you do can really affect the overall outcome, but the rookies usually get a chance to play on the big stage.","Am I the next Bill Simmons? I don't think so. I haven't built a media property. He's the best at finding voices he likes and paying people money to work for him.","I live in New York City, but I live in Hoboken because it's cheaper there, and I can own a condo.","I would love to learn how to start my own production company and start it in Boston.","I'm so jealous of people who in second grade knew what they wanted to do."],"Katie Price":["I am happy to receive any items of jewelry.","I enjoy horse riding, spending time with my dog 'Smurf,' and basically having a really good laugh partying and having fun!","I'm so loud, as if I know what I'm on about, but deep inside, I'm so insecure. Just a little girl.","All I want is a gentleman. I'm sick to bloody death of bastards.","I hate going out in Brighton now. It's different in London. People respect you more there.","If you want to stay in the business then you've got to be a bit shrewd, haven't you?","I know I will die in a car crash.","All I've ever really done is page 3 in The Sun, and not every man reads that.","As a child, I've always been in trouble with men and the police have always had to get involved, through no fault of my own.","Hopefully I'll be successful with the singing, but there are so many other things I want to do, like acting. I'll do them one at a time first!","I didn't fancy any of my teachers.","I do like my hair being pulled from time to time, it's like a pair of reins, innit?","I don't really want to do topless stuff anymore.","I get really saucy after a few drinks. Sexy rude, not obnoxious rude.","I have loads of underwear, but only wear the bras because I never wear knickers.","I like protective men, the type who'll put an arm around me so I can be smothered.","I never ask anyone for anything. I've just not been brought up like that.","I really hate sitcoms on television with canned laughter and stuff. What really makes me laugh is the real-life stuff. I've got a dry sense of humor.","I stick to my own type when I go out, and I don't make friends with people just because they're celebrities.","I think I must have a super-fast metabolism.","I used to flirt with girls just to get the guys circling around us. I'm getting out of it now. I have to look after my reputation.","I want to do other things like more fashion campaigns.","I was a real rebel. I got expelled.","I'm desperate to start a career in music.","I'm not into one-night stands. I've only slept with three guys in my life and they all involve relationships.","I'm quite an insecure person and need reassuring all the time.","I've always ridden horses.","Men seem to think that page 3 girls are only interested in money. Money doesn't impress me at all. Not in the slightest.","People are people. All that celebrity tagging doesn't bother me at all.","The men I find myself attracted to are the ones who don't say anything and are quite shy.","The only ones I trust really are my Mum and Dad and those who are closest to me.","The people who ask me for my autograph are the people who've put me here today, and you can't afford to forget that.","When I was 17 I sent a picture up to an agency, and within a week I was in The Sun five days in a row.","When I was younger, I used to say, One day I'll be famous.","You do get some weirdos, but if there are any nice people out there who want to write to me pleasantly, then they'll get a pleasant reply back!","I like my old nose. If I could get it out the cupboard and put it on, then I would.","My main dream - and I'm trying to get 'Living TV' to do it - is to go into prison and interview serial killers, rapists, murderers, psychopaths.","I'm so interested in the brain. I read true crime.","I don't mind anyone asking me any questions, I've got nothing to hide. I like it to be as real as it is, that's what I call an interview.","When I was growing up, I said I wanted to be a model, but people said I had no chance and when I realized my ambition, people in the business still continued to state negative stuff.","The most fascinating person I have met so far is indeed Mr. Hugh Hefner. An incredible man!","I like to spend time with my family. The majority of my time is spent in London, but I do like to escape and spend time with them in my hometown of Brighton on the south coast.","I've had Botox and all that - why not? There's no cream that gets rid of wrinkles; that's a load of rubbish in my eyes. But Botox does.","My middle name should be 'Drama,' but I love it. I think everyone should have some kind of stress in their life; otherwise, it's boring isn't it?","I don't care what anyone says. It's my life, and I can do what I like.","I love 'X Factor,' and I love Sharon: she's brilliant.","Just because you have kids doesn't mean to say you need time off. I have a lot of time off anyway. If I'm promoting my book, like, for the next two weeks, I'm flat out. But then I'm off again. And when you've got the next product, it's the same; you just condense it into a couple of weeks.","I don't think I'm beautiful. I just think I can scrub up OK.","I don't mind anyone asking me any questions, I've got nothing to hide. I like it to be as real as it is; that's what I call an interview. I'm not someone who's like 'Right, you can't ask this, that, this, that, this, that.' It's got to be a real interview. I've literally got nothing to hide.","Unfortunately with the media, the red tops, and all the celebrity weekly magazines, the ones who were once loyal - well, when I say loyal, this is a game; this is a game that we're in. If it's your time to get picked on, then you get picked on, and, you know, I'm used to that."],"Katie Stevens":["You're always in love with your best friend. That's why you're best friends.","I think that they way my parents raised me, they taught me to always follow my dreams and never give up, no matter what the obstacle.","Bronzer keeps me glowing, and a little blush makes it look natural.","Like everyone, I had low self-esteem, and I wanted to be like the pretty, popular girls.","I like to look effortless, so I just accentuate my favorite features.","It was a pleasure to work with everybody at 'American Idol' and to be able to be part of the 'Idol' family.","I'm going to keep pursuing my dream, keep singing and, hopefully, move to L.A.","I was overwhelmed when people started to know who I was.","My issue was I was always the friend and never the girl, so I always had crushes on guys, and they all wanted to date my friends.","Any time you have a dream job of where you want to work, it's so incredible, and I don't think that people realize it could go away.","I always say, even in this industry that I'm in - I'm on a show today, but the show could get cancelled.","I've been watching 'American Idol' half my life, and I wanted to audition since I was 8.","Take care of your skin! Wash your face every morning and night, and be sure to moisturize!","SPF and moisturizer are two things that will ensure you stay younger-looking longer! I moisturize my entire body right when I get out of the shower, and I always use makeup with an SPF.","I have to stay true to who I am.","I find myself saying 'sorry' for things I shouldn't be sorry for, haha.","Laughs are always needed.","I hate flying. I literally cry in the airport sometimes. I didn't used to; the more I fly, the worse it gets. It's weird!","I definitely want to put out and album, kind of like a Kelly Clarkson vibe: a soulful voice with a pop rock background. I think it's something that I've always loved and always loved to perform. So that's the kind of album that I'd like to put out.","In high school, I felt pressure to fit in with groups and with people who didn't actually want to be my friend. That's something I learned moving forward into adulthood: to keep the people around me people who love me for exactly who I am.","I wanted to be good at sports, even though I wasn't.","I always say it doesn't matter what age you are: everything is like high school.","I didn't necessarily hit rock bottom, but I was working at Sprinkles Cupcakes and trying to make money, not wanting to tell anybody that I was getting a job because other people that I knew from 'Idol' were like, 'Why aren't you singing places and making money off of the Idol name?' And I was like, 'Because I don't only want to be known for that.'","'American Idol' gives people really wonderful opportunities, and they shouldn't take flak for what people do with that opportunity after they leave the show. A lot of casting rooms I was in, that was the only thing on my resume, and people would just be like, 'Oh, here's Katie Stevens. Another 'American Idol' girl who thinks she could be an actor.'","Whatever I do, I have to put 100 percent of my focus into it because I don't like to do a bad job.","'Faking It' was hard for me to let go of because I knew how many kids it helped.","Meryl Streep is my favorite actor of all time, period. That would be a dream to be in something with her. I just think there's so much I can learn from her.","My favorite thing is when I work with anybody - crew, hair, makeup - I always love to ask who's the coolest person they've worked with in terms of who's been the kindest and most down to earth. A lot of people have said Meryl Streep.","One of the best decisions I ever made was getting a dog."],"Katie Taylor":["It's important to have a healthy balanced diet but not to get too bogged down about it. It's important to enjoy your food, too.","I think every fight is a tough fight, but I'm not settling for a bronze medal.","I know MMA isn't for everyone. It is a combat sport; some people don't like watching it, but it is entertainment for some people.","I do a good job of staying positive and just moving on.","When you're so consistent, people have to stand up and take notice. I don't think people recognise or praise consistency enough.","You're clearing your mind during a workout. Boxing is a great sport for girls; it's really safe.","Mental strength is something you either have or you haven't.","I look at what's in front of me. I concentrate on that and then hopefully move on.","Age is a chronological number. That's all. There is plenty of time for my life afterwards. I'm still a young woman.","Sometimes, the plans in your heart aren't God's plan.","I love playing for Ireland, and I love soccer, but when it comes down to it, I would choose boxing as my number one sport, as I'd miss it too much if I wasn't involved.","I never think about losing. That's why it's so hard to accept a loss.","My training diet can be quite strict when I'm coming up to competition; it's a weight-making sport, of course. But I eat quite healthily anyway, and it's less strict when out of competition.","I love all sorts of food, chocolate especially. I eat well, but I like the odd Chinese, like anyone!","I wouldn't really call myself a feminist. I obviously want equality and equal opportunities to the men.","I just happen to be a woman and involved in sport, but that doesn't necessarily make me a feminist.","I would love to be able to speak my own language and maybe have an interview in Irish, maybe after my fights.","Fighting at the Olympics has been my lifelong dream, and I cannot believe I am there now.","There's not a lot of positive role models of women in newspapers and magazines. I think it puts pressure on girls. They think that the image put out, it's the way you have to look.","I want to tell girls, it's not about make-up and how you look that's important; you are so much more than how you look.","Sport is a great way to keep fit. It's a stress reliever.","It's so true: the fight is won or lost in the gym, and those words really stuck with me throughout my career.","No world championship has been easy for me.","Every fight has been hard. Every world title I've won has been hard fought, and every European title I've won has been hard fought as well.","It doesn't matter who other people are saying the favourite is; I'm still going in to win the gold medal.","I'm just sorry I couldn't come home with a second Olympic gold medal.","I became number one just after the World Championships in India. I was very young then, and I remember it was just a great feeling, my first World Championship.","I tend to think year-by-year and tournament-by-tournament.","I've a great group of people, a great family behind me all the way, all the time. You cannot underestimate that.","I never think too far ahead.","I want to leave a great legacy behind me and continue to win major championships.","I want to go down in the history books as one of the greatest female boxers of all time, and I think I'm on the right path.","I am European Games champion now as well as Olympic champion, European champion, and world champion.","There's a lot of people on the way up who want to take my place, so it's up to me to continue to improve.","I love being the favourite of every competition.","I'm the one that everyone is trying to beat.","I'm in a privileged position, but I still feel like the best is yet to come, and people still haven't seen the best of me yet, and that is so exciting for me.","There is an awful lot of pressure on me.","The best boxers don't always qualify for the Olympics. You can easily have a bad day, but please God, that won't happen to me.","I have a lot of confidence in myself, and I love that challenge as well. I love going to every competition as the favourite. It's something I relish.","It's great to be boxing a local boxer. The atmosphere is always fantastic. I love those fights. I really relish those fights.","I'm honoured and delighted to be named the 'Irish Times'/Irish Sports Council Sportswoman of the Year 2014. This has been an amazing year for me and for Irish women in sport, and I would like to congratulate all the finalists in their respective fields who have excelled at major sporting events.","I'm not going to be boxing forever, but I've put no time-cap on it, really.","As long as I still feel a passion for the sport and preparing for these big competitions, I will carry on fighting.","I have stayed positiv,e and I believe I am still improving in every competition I enter.","I've been offered a few professional contracts... in the hundreds and thousands.","The thing with professional boxing is you have to have the right promoter and the right fights. It is a cut-throat business.","You have to make sure you have the right people around you to get the right fights, and you're not guaranteed to get the best fights.","With amateur boxing, you're just entered into a competition. And to be the best, you've got to beat the best. You're not waiting around to get these fights organised.","I could have 10 kids or be boxing until I'm 40.","I've had losses in my career before, and I've always come back stronger from those losses.","I'm a huge fan of Conor McGregor, an incredible athlete. What he has done for MMA is phenomenal; he has been a great supporter of me.","I'd love to have a chance to fight in the World Series Boxing for women, but nothing has been done about that.","I know how it feels to lose.","I think it's important to feel those losses because I never want to feel like that again.","I always go into a fight thinking the decision is going to be fair, and I relish these fights where the atmosphere is so fantastic.","I've boxed many people in their own backyard plenty of times - in China, I boxed a Chinese girl in the final of the world championships, and I've boxed Russians before in their home nation as well.","I don't really change much; there's not much I can do about the judging in front of a home crowd.","I go into every fight trying to win as easy as I can.","People say, 'You will be 30 years old; you're too old. You'll get your nose broke,' say dad's a pushy dad. You hear stupid things and put them out of your mind.","I'm in the public eye. I'm recognised a small bit more. That's part and parcel of it.","The heaviest I've ever been is 65 kilos. That was during my Leaving Cert when I was just studying and eating chocolate.","The Olympics is a dream of mine.","I'd like to thank everyone for all their support and prayers. I'm so humbled by that.","When I have a few weeks off, I catch up with my friends, but after a week or so, I just can't wait to get back in to the boxing club and start training.","Boxing was just another one to keep me going as a child.","We do the weigh-in, then go for a walk, then have breakfast, then I listen to worship songs on my iPod because I'm a Christian. I always read the same Bible verses, too. We do the same warm-up a lot of the time as well. But, I have no superstitions before a fight.","I don't feel much pressure at all. I have great family support, and they take a lot of pressure off me. They help to control media and public interest.","It's ridiculous having the pros in an amateur sport, but at the same time, there's a lot of pros who are going to struggle over three rounds.","I think, probably, my best asset would probably be my all round game.","I can definitely box on the front foot as well as the back foot. I don't think that's really an issue.","I don't even wear miniskirts on a night out, so I definitely won't be wearing miniskirts in the ring.","There have been a lot of challenges over the years that I have overcome.","The pressure was huge going into London, definitely.","It's always tough to stay at the top for so long.","Definitely, there's a lot of strength in depth in my division.","I wouldn't be where I am without my dad. He's a genius.","I always feel like the freshest boxer going into competitions.","I owe so much to my dad and what he has done for me. And it's hard work doing what he has done, so he's entitled to a break.","It's such a shame, really, because we were known for our country of saints and scholars, and we grew up with such a great tradition with St. Patrick, and he is the one who brought Christianity to Ireland, and we celebrate St. Patrick's day every single year, but there's very few practising Catholics or practising Christians.","The Bible is my sport psychology manual.","God is my psychologist. And my dad is probably the best sport psychologist in the world.","I don't get complacent, because I know if you slack off, you're going to be found out. This is international boxing, and every fight is a tough fight.","Anything other than a gold medal will be disappointing.","It's so great to be able to inspire these young women today to get involved in male-dominated subjects.","I know exactly what that's all about being in a male dominated sport. Sometimes it just takes one person to step out, to be a pioneer, a trailblazer, really.","There are so many career opportunities out there now for young women, and it's great to have the opportunity to encourage them to get involved in these new careers.","After I came back from London with a gold medal, my focus straight away was to defend it four years on.","I always come into these competitions hoping to come away with a gold medal. I won't relax until I have the gold medal around my neck.","It's the training that's the hardest. It's the preparation. The months and months of preparation that nobody really sees, that's the hardest part.","I can enjoy myself and express myself in the ring.","People need to get out and do some more exercise, especially children who are stuck inside with computers.","Going to the cinema or a meal can be difficult, with people asking for pictures or autographs.","Don't call me famous, but it's hard to be out with my friends now.","It's great for my confidence getting a letter saying 'All I want from life, Katie, is you and health.'","I would have loved to have met Roger Federer.","I never went through an easy fight. Every fight has been hard fought.","It is frustrating, but all I can do is just keep winning, and hopefully, people will stand up and take notice eventually."],"Kato Kaelin":["Sometimes people just want you to fail. Except your really good friends. I've always known who my best friends were.","I'm not going to just fade out, I know.","It's incredible when I'm out in these towns. I have people telling me they were waiting for hours just to meet me and get my autograph. I feel so guilty. I always feel like I have to give them more than just Kato Kaelin.","I don't want to be Kato, the trial guy. It's like everything I do is under a microscope.","The circumstance is the incredible part, but I always knew in my heart that something was going to be out there, just for the world to notice me. It sounds so cocky, but it's happening.","I think that money is the root of all evil. I've seen it happen.","Sometimes people who get wealthy when they are very, very young, it's a curse to them. They don't realize it.","I'm doing comedy development at National Lampoon.","I was at an acting academy for seven years prior to the trial.","Never live with someone that won the Heisman.","Thoughts would go in and out of my mind, but I didn't want to believe that he could have done it.","I think the prosecution had all the evidence in front of them to have won the case.","I have contact with no one involved in the trial.","I was never OJ's closest pal, and the media would say that over and over, but I wasn't his enemy either.","At the time that I knew them, they were not living together. They began dating again after their divorce, so I didn't really see fighting.","I want people to realize that the domestic abuse charges happened in 1989. I didn't meet any of them until 1993.","I'm not afraid of O.J. now.","I ended up living at OJ's because Nicole bought a home that no longer had a guest house. OJ offered his guest house to me. Anybody in LA looking for a place knows the best places to live are guest houses.","The media works in sound bites. They can make you look like a genius or stupid.","If there's something that you hear on TV about me, just call me and I'll tell you if it's true.","I thought it was possible that O.J. could have done something. It crossed my mind. I was thinking about the events of everything and going, Why did I hear that? I was going, No, it can't be, and just all that stuff was adding up.","I believe in my heart Simpson is guilty.","People should realize that I shot a Coke commercial back in 1986. So, you know, I've been around a long time. I carry my Screen Actors Guild Card.","I'm the guy, I'm kind of like the, uh, Everyman, so I think people just relate to that."],"Katori Hall":["Don't let others put thoughts into your mind that takes away your self-confidence.","Follow your intuition, listening to your dreams, your inner voice to guide you.","Serendipity always rewards the prepared.","I used to think people above me might get jealous because I wanted to do what they did. But no, people are much nicer than that.","Become your dream, and not be told what you are supposed to do.","I never, ever read the comments below an article on the Web. People are mean. I'm a human being.","I always crave to see more stories about and by people of color, particularly new work by young black writers.","Cultivating relationships with people who've achieved what you want to achieve makes the path fuller and more fun.","Playwrights are the most gregarious writers - to get our work done, we need actors, directors, set designers.","I'll never be August Wilson - but what I can be is more of myself.","I'm very Southern in the way I walk in the world. I love to laugh. I love to eat. I love to hug people. But if somebody makes me mad, my neck may roll. I can be aggressive with a Southern twang.","I'm very opinionated, very intelligent and not afraid to show that.","Most of the time, when I'm writing, I'm writing for myself. I'm thinking, 'What will my character say at this time? What will come out of her mouth?' I create individuals so real to me, I sometimes start talking to them. Then I let them loose on the page.","I can only speak for myself, but when I was growing up in Memphis - and having the Martin Luther King holiday and the moment of pause on April 4th - he was just a statue to me. I wanted to make him a little bit more real to me as a human being.","As a black woman who grows up in a predominantly white neighborhood, you learn how to perform a 'good' version of yourself. And then when you're with your home girls, you're saying all kinds of stuff that sounds all kinds of crazy, but you understand each other because you're speaking the way that you're comfortable with.","We expect our leaders to be godlike. But I feel that when people try to sanctify leadership, it puts it out of the realm of regular people. And that's where the greatest leaders come from - from the people.","Sometimes, unfortunately, hatred is more powerful than progress.","I grew up playing with kids from Hurt Village, playing with kids from other housing projects, Lamar Terrace, because my grandmother lived in that particular area. So, I always wondered how I would have turned out if I would have lived in that particular given circumstance.","Many theaters are tackling the multifaceted work of black writers - established and emerging. Now the next step is for them to bring in audiences of color and continue to go out to our community and create a continuous connection that extends beyond the one black show in the season.","I think being an actor makes me a better writer and vice versa. I know the kinds of roles I would kill to play, and I try to create them for others.","I feel a responsibility to continue creating complex roles for black women, especially young black women.","Unlike films, which can be easily disseminated worldwide via DVDs and the Internet, plays struggle to find an international audience.","It is expensive to give plays subtitles, especially for a short run, so most new dramas rarely cross the transcontinental bridge.","Like most playwrights, I hate talkbacks with a passion that can burn a hole through hell.","In order to be great, you just have to care. You have to care about your world, community, and equality.","'Hurt Village' is based on a real housing project in Memphis, about three minutes away from the Lorraine Hotel where Dr. King was assassinated, so in my work I'm focusing on a very specific area in Memphis. I see 'Hurt Village' as a natural extension of 'The Mountaintop.'","Theatre is an exclusive place that tends to be dominated by white men, or dying white men.","Through school, I saw plenty of theatre my parents weren't necessarily up on. They would prefer a football game to watching 'The Nutcracker,' and that's fine. I enjoy both.","I have so many different voices and stories to tell.","I feel the feminist movement has excluded black women. You cannot talk about being black and a woman within traditional feminist dialogue.","I started writing because I got so frustrated that there weren't enough plays that had roles for young black women in them.","I always felt like Broadway was not for me - in terms of ticket price, in terms of what was on there. I never saw myself reflected in the mirror of the Great White Way."],"Katrina Adams":["Few players hit the swinging forehand volley as often, or as well, as Maria Sharapova.","A bad toss is one of the most common causes of a bad serve, and most tosses are bad because players release the ball too soon, flick their wrists, or both.","I was the ultimate tomboy because my oldest brother used to always beat up on me and wrestle and make sure I was engaged in sports, because I was his excuse to be able to go hang out with his friends.","I was throwing a spiral football at 6.","I'm a competitor in everything that I do. I love to compete.","My parents have been unbelievable. Obviously, without them, I wouldn't be where I am.","I was fortunate to have people like Althea Gibson come and speak to me, also Leslie Allen and Arthur Ashe. So I feel obligated, part of my duty, to continue to pass on the knowledge I've learned to youngsters and adults alike.","Tennis is a very interesting world. It's a sport of opportunities, but it's a sport of challenges as well. And for anybody to continue to progress, they have to understand what those challenges are.","Anything with the title 'Breaking The Barriers' means a lot to us, and to myself in particular, because if it wasn't for those who broke the barrier of color before me, I would not have the opportunity to live the life I'm leading right now.","I'm a visual learner, so with hand-eye coordination, I was a natural.","I stumbled into tennis.","I was eighth in the world in doubles, 67th in singles. Could I have achieved more? Yes, perhaps, but I did it my way.","My role at the USTA allows me to fulfill my ambition to open up opportunities for people to play tennis that may not otherwise have a chance or an outlet to play.","Changing the dialogue and behaviors around race and equality in sports starts with removing barriers and creating opportunities.","As a kid, I used to love going to the arcade. I used to tell my parents I was working on my hand-eye coordination. It was probably just a way to get more quarters from them.","When I was a kid, people reached out and gave me a chance.","There were so many people who were instrumental in helping me get better. They say it takes a village, and the tennis community has been my village. That's why I've always felt that I have a responsibility to give back.","My parents raised me that way: to appreciate what I have and pass it along to others.","My goal is to play better than my seed. If I'm seeded sixth, I want to try to go to the semifinals. If I'm seeded third, I'm going to shoot for the finals.","With Venus and Serena and their ascension - and you had a lot of kids that saw them and wanted to be like them - it's like any sport, any major athlete, like Michael Jordan in basketball: everybody wanted to be like Mike.","My parents were teachers.","I grew up in the USTA's junior circuit.","Northwestern was never known as a sports school. I was proud to add a national title to the school.","In college, you become truly independent; your discipline is honed. It has to be there for your studies. It helped make me who I am, and it increased my determination to be the best I could be.","Everything that I do is with a purpose and intent of wanting to make a difference.","A new sport is being created every day in the U.S.","It is difficult for our youth to want to be active when PE is taken out of our schools.","We want to make tennis look like America when it comes to cultural backgrounds.","I was a player who was vying to do exactly what everyone else was doing, and I happened to be black.","Someone had to lend me a hand or two to pull me forward. I feel it's my duty to make sure I do the same.","I don't take no for an answer.","I went to Northwestern. I bleed purple and white.","Billie Jean King always was there for me as a role model. She always fought for equality, and that always stood out as I was coming up.","We are a traditional sport in an innovative society, and so trying to make change is always a task.","When we introduced 10-and-under tennis - when we shortened the courts and had smaller rackets and low-compression balls for trying to introduce the sport to youth - a lot of people said we weren't going to succeed.","We make sure that we continue to educate our youth on who Althea Gibson and Arthur Ashe were.","What we instill in our kids is that if you work hard, good things will happen.","Serena Williams is the ultimate champion. She knows what it takes to get to the top.","Serena Williams is the greatest tennis player of all time, the greatest female athlete of all time, the greatest athlete of all time.","I grew up in youth programs in Chicago, so they are definitely close to my heart. It is all about helping kids and giving back to a sport that has given me so much.","For players from every age and every ability, the USTA National Campus will raise the bar on how we deliver tennis with the goal of making our great sport more accessible to more people than ever before.","It can be difficult playing friends. But you also have to know that it's a match, and this is what you do. And you do your best.","I try to walk when I'm playing golf so I get some exercise in.","I think tennis is very different than most of the other sports when you have the opportunity to go pro. For me, it was pretty simple. Tennis was always an individual sport, and your direct results determined where you could go and what you could do.","If you get into the main draw of a Grand Slam, then you've made your mark and proved that's where you belong.","As athletes, the biggest asset that we bring to the workplace is our work ethic, our confidence, our never-say-die attitude. We're about winning."],"Katrina Bowden":["Focus on the positives and be grateful.","I was a dork. I'm still kind of goofy and clumsy and not always the most graceful person.","I love doing horror with comedy twists and I think it's a really fun genre.","I'm not a huge fan of horror movies myself because I'm a big baby and I get too scared to watch them.","Keith Powell and Judah Friedlander are like brothers to me.","I'm a big fan of spinning and yoga. To strengthen my core, kick-boxing is really effective. The resistance tones everything, and it's a great stress reliever.","I can't say, 'I eat whatever I want when I want,' but I have come up with some great treats for myself that are healthy and satisfying.","Kate Spade has great feminine classics and I love her bags. Designs by Rebecca Taylor, BCBG and Herve Leger are sexy and fun, and they work on my body.","I try not to eat too much dairy or gluten.","I've learned to brush off many things.","It is a challenge at times, but trying to stay centered and balanced helps me keep things in perspective."],"Katrina Kaif":["Going by my past journey, I am not certain where life will take me, what turns and twists will happen; nobody knows where they will end up. As life changes direction, I'll flow with it.","Every one has her own love life. Every one has a dream to get a perfect life partner. But this is not so easy in real life. In fact, one doesn't love; it happens.","I have a very positive attitude in life. My insecurity, fear and need to know about tomorrow has fortunately eased. What is going to happen will happen anyway. So why break my head over it?","I feel it is important not to get overly obsessed and overly carried away with just the physical aspect. There is more to beauty than just the physical appearance. You are also a complete person, and a woman should have an identity beyond just the way she looks.","I'm not a television anchor for a Hindi channel or a radio jockey. So I may not be able to have a spontaneous conversation in Hindi. I'm a Bollywood actress, and I can certainly speak my dialogue in Hindi.","I don't believe there is any point in holding on to too many things in life.","For me, physical beauty is never the reason for attraction to anyone.","I'm not a big spender or shopper. Neither am I extravagant, nor do I have big expenses. I mainly spend on travel. I don't buy overpriced clothes, as I feel such expenses are unnecessary. I probably wouldn't buy expensive watches or jewellery either.","I believe in destiny, God's hand and hard work.","If you're a public figure, people have the right to speculate and gossip.","Guys never looked at me. I always had crushes on older seniors who never looked at me. So, when I tell directors that I wanna play that girl who gets rejected, they're like, 'Why?' I tell them it's because I relate to that girl much more than being the girl who makes jaws drop when she walks into a room.","I live my life exactly the way I want to. Nothing stops me from going out or being anywhere that I want to be. I am doing whatever I want to do. I do not live my life according to any restrictions whatsoever!","Love should be all about giving and trusting.","I wanted to be an actress. I wanted to be known. Yes, it's difficult sometimes. I believe that if you're going to be in a profession like this, which is so open to criticism, to speculation, you need to have people around you who will believe in you and stand by you.","I've never made a plan for my life. I have just taken whatever opportunities have come and been very genuine with them.","There's competition in every field, and that's healthy. It makes you work harder and be your best. Competition, not in terms of money or number of projects, but in the quality of your work, is very healthy.","Like the Bond girl, there's a stigma attached to being a 'Dhoom' girl. You have to look pretty good, and people are going to judge you.","My only plan every day is to get up and go to work, work hard and come back home. And whatever else needs to happen in my life will come in its own time.","Financial security is crucial for your family, and I have a large family. Money does matter when you don't have it. When you need it, you realise the value of it. In that sense, money will always have value.","I believe that if you reject and don't respect what you have now, that's ingratitude. I'm grateful for everything I have today.","I will give my life to whoever in need, to any dear friend of mine.","I think what you learn from relationships is that they are unpredictable.","Learning what all you can overcome as a person, as a human being, is very important. It's very important to understand your strength. Which is not to say you become hardened or bitter.","When you're walking at the airport, you're expected to smile at people because they know you... I find that tough. I'm only trying to protect myself. So I don't take my eyes off the floor. People can take that as attitude. But it's actually shyness. Yes, it is a bad habit. But it's a defense mechanism.","I would die without goals or a focus. I need something to keep me going.","I want to clear this once and for all. I was born in Hong Kong. I grew up in Japan and China. London is not home for me. I was there only for three years before I moved to India, but that's probably why I am connected with it. London is definitely not the place I consider my home. It's India that I consider home.","You have to grow. I can't be the same person I was at 18; otherwise, I'd be stagnant.","I have an impeccable memory, and I can learn dialogues in any language in 20 minutes, including Telugu and Malayalam.","I seriously don't take praise to my heart or to my head. I only want to work harder and never get complacent.","I don't click pictures. People carry a camera with them while travelling, take pictures, keep them as memories, but I don't. I don't even have a camera.","I am a religious person and rely heavily on prayers.","Nobody would be an actor if he/she were not charming at some level.","I have never dissected my personal life. What sense would it make?","I think I have been very conscious throughout my career. I can't go back and remember every line of every ad I have done, but I think in the most part I have been pretty conscious that we are not making a wrong claim. I am pretty confident with everything I do.","With every film, we form a small little world for a period of time. Everybody is close, and then one fine day everything is over. That can throw you off. So you have to learn to take things in your stride and not get too emotional about people or situations.","I was always interested in fabric, clothes and designing. Maybe I would have been a designer by profession if I didn't start acting.","I'd like to do an action film like Angelina Jolie's 'Salt.'","All my life, I have judged my worth by how much I have been loved by a man. It's so with a lot of women, that their self-esteem is measured by how much they are loved by a man, their partner, their boyfriend or maybe their husband. In my case, it may be because I grew up without my father.","Dance has been a big passion for me.","You have to understand, beauty differs from country to country. When I came to India, I found my sense of belonging and appreciation. People thought I was beautiful.","There was a time when I desperately wanted to be part of a Yash Chopra film, not because he was a great director, but because I was an outsider and I wanted that validation of being accepted in the film industry.","I realised that you can go through times of extreme happiness, but if that happiness is not coming from a deeply rooted place, you will also be going through extreme lows of sadness.","No support of one star or one director or one producer can make any individual actor a star. You have to connect with the audience; the audience have to like you. That is something that cannot be manipulated or fought for or tried for. Either they like you, or they don't.","There are so many actors whom I can be paired with... like Hrithik Roshan, but there hasn't been an opportunity. Abhishek and I looked good together in 'Sarkar.' And of course, there's Shah Rukh Khan, but I haven't been offered a film with him yet. I hope to work with them in the future; it's just a matter of time.","I'm here to work.. not to like or dislike people. Neither am I here to win a Miss Congeniality competition. I maintain professional relations with my co-stars.","I think people who are regarded as better actors must have better instincts because, at the end of the day, once they say 'action,' it's you who has to do it right. You can do all the research and preparation or none at all, but it's your instincts that tell you, 'No, I'll do it like this.'","You can try to plan your career, but not marriage.","Salman Khan did not help me get movie offers. What rubbish! Will any producer take a risk of millions of rupees at the instance of any person? Everyone knows that the film industry is highly competitive, and one gets a job on one's talent only and not on any recommendation.","My relationship with Salman Khan is too personal to talk about. I take my work like any other regular job, and what I do in my personal life is no one's business. I'd rather let my work do all the talking.","It's not my style to either wear minimum clothes, to strip, or to even be comfortable with a sex-symbol label. I just want to do good work instead of sporting such meaningless tags. Sex sells, but to a small extent, not always. And this is what filmmakers have to accept.","At the end of the day, it is about working in a good film. It's the films that you leave behind that matter.","Luck and being honest and sincere about work has worked for me and helped me reach where I am.","I make an attempt to do different kinds of films. There's no such formula for guaranteed success.","You don't really know how your film is going to turn out, but you can give it your best shot and hope the audience loves it. This has been my approach right from the beginning, and it's helped me a lot in my journey. All you can do is give the film your everything.","'Moral police' is my new word. I am very against the media doing moral policing, giving opinions on actor's lives. Media should not become moral police; they should just report.","My choice of films has never been governed by money. That is perhaps why I don't have a very fancy bank account. I'd rather get respect and creative satisfaction through my work than just earn money.","I don't have any great detail or logic or exact point that I look for in a film. It's just if I get a good sense from it and I feel that there is something interesting that we may be able to do with it, then I just kind of go for it.","I don't know if there's ever been a female-driven film or a male-driven film. I don't believe in that. I believe a film is a film - a movie can only work if everything about the film works.","I'm a private person. And I have a certain way in which I protect myself. I don't openly wear my feelings.","I have done many comedy films. Success of films like 'Partner,' 'Singh is Kinng' gets you to a very wide audience reach. But for greater gains, you need to take greater gambles. If it works, you get respect and recognition.","Personally, I'm a simple dresser. I usually buy my own clothes. Jeans, T-shirts, summer dresses and track pants. Whenever I get the time or see a shop that catches my fancy, I buy something."],"Katrina Lake":["Find someone within the company who is on another team but is at a similar level or role as you to be a friend, a sounding board, and a place to go for candid feedback. Find a mentor within the company who resembles the leader you'd like to grow to be.","Every day, every one of us sets the stage for our sentiment, our confidence, and our success by getting dressed. When you feel great, when you feel your best, it opens up a world of possibility. Feeling confident and self-assured are important inputs into good days, successful days, and happy days.","Clearly define what success means for you. Set short-term and quarterly career goals with your manager that will help lead you to your long term goals.","Ultimately, my belief is that the best marketing is creating a product that people are excited to talk about. Period.","Be known as a great resource. Are you an Excel genius? An expert on local restaurants? Fabulous at proofreading? Go beyond your job description by being an open resource for others in the company who could benefit from your talents. I believe that paying it forward will serve you well one way or another in the future.","I'm most passionate about personalization. I firmly believe that personalized experiences with brands will most drive loyalty and relevance for customers in the future.","Brick and mortar stores will ultimately mark down between 50 to 60% of its merchandise because they don't know who's walking in the door on any day, so they lose control.","I find it is a bad habit to look at social media before bed, so I try to read something on paper - not on my phone - before I go to bed.","Creativity was definitely a big part of our household, and I remember always writing stories and being encouraged to be creative.","I founded Stitch Fix to take on a very human problem: How do I find clothes I love? Like most people, I want to look stylish and feel my best. Spending a day at the mall or devoting hours of time to sifting through millions of products online is time consuming, overwhelming, and neither effective nor enjoyable. I knew there had to be another way.","Figuring out how to scale the very human art of personalization is difficult, but I believe that it is also the key to building a lasting connection with customers for the long term.","I love cooking. It's what clears my mind, since it's pretty hard to multitask when you're chopping vegetables.","I wanted to be a doctor. I was pre-med at school, and I actually even took the MCAT. My ultimate decision was that I didn't love the work environment in a hospital.","When I feel like work and life are both going well, I feel like I can be fully present at both. I think the reminder to me is that both are super important, and I need to be able to feel like I can experience both in the way that makes me happiest. If I'm not happy in one or the other, it really affects the other side.","I've always enjoyed shopping and loved fashion, but my interest as an entrepreneur was definitely more about the opportunities I saw to change the future of retail. My sister was a buyer in New York, and she knew my body and my style, and she could find me things I loved. I thought, 'What if everybody had access to this kind of experience?'","When the business really works is when we hear clients say, 'I've never had jeans that fit me until I got a pair from Stitch Fix.' We'll also hear, 'I would never have tried this dress on in a store.' It's not just about convenience. They're happier in their clothes.","My goal was to have a company off the ground by the time I graduated. But the worst-case scenario was I would have an MBA and a lot of opportunities ahead of me.","There are millions and millions of products out there. You can look at eBay and Amazon. You can look at every product on the planet, but trying to figure out which one is best for you is really the challenge.","The idea of going somewhere where the salesperson is able to personalize the retail experience for you doesn't work anymore. Stitch Fix is an opportunity to provide a service for people who are looking for more than just buying the cheapest thing with one-day shipping.","I like to wear more traditional work outfits like pants and a blouse, but I want the blouse to have something that is a little bit different and interesting - like with some studs on it or a little bit of lace. I want to feel comfortable and confident and don't want to have to think too much about what I wear every day.","Ultimately, I didn't quite find the company I wanted to join, but I met more than 100 entrepreneurs and realized that all these entrepreneurs were just as unqualified as I was. If I wanted to be this retailer of the future, or if I wanted to join the retailer of the future, I could just start it.","As a consumer, you don't want to choose from a million pairs of jeans. You just want the one pair that's going to fit you and look great on you.","Customer-centricity is unbelievably important.","Not a manager or an executive yet? It's not too early to practice. Many companies are always looking for people to volunteer to help coordinate happy hours, onboard new employees, or plan the holiday party.","Delivering a service that consumers feel truly connected to and providing an experience that people love and love to organically share and talk about is the most effective form of marketing I know.","'Personalization' is a popular word in retail, and people often misuse it to describe simple marketing tactics, like segmenting emails or using big data to identify the likely gender of a visitor to their websites.","Ironically, I think some of the inspiration around Stitch Fix is really what was great about stores in the heyday of stores.","When I founded Stitch Fix, I wanted to create a company that I would want to work at for the rest of my life."],"Katrina Law":["I had originally done a production called 'The Resistance.' It was one of those underground guerilla things, very low budget. Then Starz and Ghost House ended up picking it up and funding it, and we reshot it.","'Mafiosa' was written by Veronica Russo. It's her first time making a film, and I'm really proud of her because this woman has a full-time job, and she decided one day, 'You know, I want to write a film, and I want to make it.'"],"Katt Williams":["Golf is a game with morals. There's always an opportunity to be a scoundrel. That's why it's a gentleman's game.","I go where people are hurting. I stand on the stage, and I make people laugh for an hour and a half.","That is the job of a comedian: To take unpleasant subject matter and forcibly, with his hands, wring the funny out of it.","If you didn't laugh at Jared Fogle, then you would cry."],"Katy B":["I love clubbing - the abandon of it, the release of dancing, and being with my friends and the people I love. For me, it's never been about going out to meet guys or to show off my latest dress - it's the music.","I don't think I represent all things dubstep. I just like clubbing, so those are the sounds I've chosen to work with.","When I was 13, listening to Choice FM, I would listen to a lot of R&B from America, and whenever a British person tried to do it, it didn't really work, they just sounded like they were trying to copy that whole style. Now the music sounds British, something real rather than an imitation.","Things go in cycles. It's like fashion, like flares go out then skinny jeans come in, people want something fresh. It's the strongest ever urban scene at the moment and I hope it can progress and keep getting stronger and be the base for something larger.","I had wanted to be a dancer when I was younger. But at some point I figured out I was a better singer.","I guess I've been making records since I was 16, and even when 50 people bought them, I thought that was amazing.","I think as long as you're being creative and finding your own work interesting, that's all that matters.","I'd love to be the new Jools Holland, but you know, for, like, cooler people.","Someone asked me the other day what my favourite record shop was, and I said YouTube.","The first time I went out under the spotlight, I was proper freaked out.","I make music, and if people like it, they like it, and some people won't.","I'm a big fan of Beyonce and Rihanna. I've listened to Beyonce all my life, and she's a big influence on me.","I love being at home now, improving my cooking. I've got a really bad memory, so my first attempts were a disaster - I'd forget what ingredients to put in. But I do a lasagna that's a crowd-pleaser, and a good lemon drizzle cake, which I take to my mom's for the Sunday roast to fatten the family up.","When I do a festival, I want everyone to have a party, I think it is kind of similar to a club where everyone is there to have a good time and celebrate not being at work or just being able to have fun. I love people dancing to my music as well; if I can make them dance I feel happy.","Studying music, everyone sort of has their own style - it's not like everyone's going for the same part.","I don't want people to think they have to like me because I'm on TV every other minute.","What I do and where I come from, the kind of music that I'm making, it's definitely U.K. If I turned around and did a tune with Timbaland, it would be amazing, but it would be me kind of leaving where I'm coming from.","I would love to have the biggest band that I can have. I'd love to put on a massive show and just give people their money's worth, then just come away from it thinking, 'That was a good show', because it's kind of disappointing sometimes when you go and see someone and you can see they're not that bothered.","I used to play the piano when I was younger, and I loved Alicia Keys. I wanted to be Alicia Keys; she was such an idol to me.","My dad was a soul fan and a singer himself, and he loved vocal harmony, stuff like the Beach Boys and Motown like the Four Tops, which was a big influence on me.","My mum loved Joan Armatrading and used to play her records all the time and even took me to see her a couple of times when I was really quite young. I didn't really like her music back then because my mum was always playing it, but I've grown to appreciate it more.","The days of an open mic night when I'd rock up in an old jumper are over.","I go to a club to relax and hear the music on a big sound system. I don't go to pull a guy.","People expect you to be this weird cartoon sometimes when you're a musician. I hate that. I hate standing out. I hate people looking at me. I just want to be part of the crowd.","I went to my first drum n' bass rave when I was 16 and remember being terrified. Looking around, trying to figure out how to dance to this music, watching some girl in some hot pants, trying little ways to learn her movements.","I went to the Brit School for the performing arts in Croydon at 14, picking music as my main subject, and I'm so glad I did. I knew lots of people who'd gone there, so I always had my mind set on it.","I've always known my own mind, and I'm not shy about speaking it.","The nice way to meet a guy is through getting to know them first. Then you can really judge their personality. What I can't take is meeting someone, going on a date, getting to know them, then finding out they're a complete psycho - 'Great, I've just wasted all this time on you!'"],"Katy Jurado":["Some of these little girls are afraid to admit they are getting older. I am not afraid. You can't put your finger in the sun and stop time.","Women can have a career, but the real career is to be a woman. It's beautiful to be a woman and give birth.","I always do what I feel and say what I think.","American women today want too much liberty; that's why they're unhappy. Because when an American man meets a woman, he treats her like a pal instead of a woman.","Some Mexicans go to Hollywood and lose career in Mexico because they play imitation. I don't want this to happen to me.","I was born with a terrible temper, but this is the way of expressing myself. I flare up, but it goes quickly, and I don't remember it long.","I didn't take all the films that were offered, just those with dignity.","I was always asked to play roles where I was the contrasting or multicultural character. Sometimes that worked for me - often it didn't."],"Katy Manning":["Life doesn't get easier but it does get funnier.","I lose things all the time. I once left my mother's ashes at a bus stop!"],"Katy Mixon":["I'm loving 'We Are Young,' by Fun. Really gets the morning rockin' to a great start.","Pensacola isn't Florida, really. It's the Panhandle. It's right up there near Alabama and Louisiana. It's, like, a stroll away from New Orleans. I feel like New Orleans is home.","A lot of people don't know that my background is completely classical. For a while there, I was all about Moliere and the Greeks and Brecht and Tennessee Williams.","My very first acting job ever, the first time I got paid to be an actress, was in 2001, right between my sophomore and junior year in college, when I was just 19 years old. I got paid $250 every two weeks, 10 shows a week, to be in the Utah Shakespearean Festival. I was Calpurnia in 'Julius Caesar.'","You can't do Shakespeare with a Southern accent, honey.","'Eastbound & Down' is giving you a rhythm. It's just a whole different vibe with improv. As an actor I just kind of exercise within my environment and adjust depending on where I'm at."],"Katy Perry":["I'm kind of a good girl - and I'm not. I'm a good girl because I really believe in love, integrity, and respect. I'm a bad girl because I like to tease. I know that I have sex appeal in my deck of cards. But I like to get people thinking. That's what the stories in my music do.","My personality is up and down, sassy and cheeky.","If you're presenting yourself with confidence, you can pull off pretty much anything.","I'm a good girl because I really believe in love, integrity, and respect. I'm a bad girl because I like to tease.","I'm happy, I'm in a good place, I'm looking forward to my future.","Find out what your gift is and nurture it.","I see everything through a spiritual lens.","I believe in a lot of astrology. I believe in aliens... I look up into the stars and I imagine: 'How self-important are we to think that we are the only life-form?'","I think it's great to dress up and play on all the girly features.","Sometimes if you want to achieve something great, there will be curveballs. You just have to dodge them every once in a while.","I can't be the candy queen forever.","People love the idea of a good girl gone bad, thinking that my parents were so strict and disowned me, but that actually wasn't the case. Even though they don't necessarily agree with some of the things I do, they love me as their daughter. That's always been their perspective.","Santa Barbara is my hood. I mean, it's not much of a hood, but it is definitely like my hood. I claim Santa Barbara like I claim my family. I'm going to be married and buried there.","I get a lot of the ideas when I'm resting - either when I'm meditating or getting some kind of work done on my back, like physical therapy or acupuncture. That's where I get my best ideas, maybe because I'm balancing my body.","One thing I can't do, and I hope that there are other people out there that feel the same way, is climb a rope. Oh my gosh, it's so hard to climb rope! It's all about grip and arms.","I unfortunately still crave chicken McNuggets and bacon, which is the meat candy of the world.","I don't feel like I'm very pop-star lame, but I'm definitely not hipster-cool.","I don't need the Prince Charming to have my own happy ending.","People talk about bullying, but you can be your own bully in some ways. You can be the person who is standing in the way of your success, and that was the case for me.","I like to go out there looking like a strong woman, because I am strong. But I am also a woman who goes through all kinds of problems and highs and lows.","I don't want to be above my audience; I want to be one with my audience.","I'm every woman. It takes a village to make me who I am.","For a modern woman it is important to be supported and that there is equality in every aspect, and that it's not two halves that make a whole - it's two wholes that make a whole.","I'm competitive with myself, and that goes hand in hand with how I present myself. I'm not only trying to put one foot in front of the other, I'm trying to put my best foot forward.","Touring is always important to me. It's like a big IOU to my fans, because I know they are the reason I exist.","I love what I do, and when I don't love what I do, I'll make a change.","I feel like my secret magic trick that separates me from a lot of my peers is the bravery to be vulnerable and truthful and honest.","I don't care what people say about my relationship; I don't care what they say about my boobs. People are buying my songs; I have a sold-out tour. I'm getting incredible feedback from my music.","I come from a very non-accepting family, but I'm very accepting.","There are a lot of things that are personally uncomfortable to show, especially me without makeup and completely bloated or crying. But I've realized that it's time for me to show my audience that you don't have to be perfect to achieve your dreams. Because nobody relates to being perfect.","When I was 13, I asked for a guitar. And that's how I really started explaining my point of view.","I pray for humility, honestly, because it's very easy to be caught up in this world.","I just like having fun. And, you know, sometimes I just like to present myself in that fun energy.","I fall in love every time. And I don't really fall in love a lot, but when I do, I fall hard.","Oh, I will always be honest with my music. The records are black boxes for me. Like if you want to know who I am, my views, my perspective, things I love, things I hate, my convictions, my anthems. I've never let people's opinions affect the way I write.","I really like to look like a history book. I can look 1940s, I can look 1970s hippie-chic, or sometimes I'll pull that '80s Brooklyn hip-hop kid with the door-knocker earrings.","Honesty has always worked for me.","People always ask me, 'What is it that you regret?' And I say, 'nothing, because I could not buy what I've learned.' And I apply those things to my life I learn. And hopefully, hopefully it helps me to be a better human in the future and make better choices.","I wasn't going to great schools, because my parents didn't believe in public education. They wanted the education to be influenced by their religion, so I was going to these halfway education-slash-Christian schools that were like pop-up shop-style education.","My parents are Republicans, and I'm not.","I did a lot of thrift and vintage. I would mix those pieces into some of the more inexpensive items from Express, Gap, Old Navy, and Clothestime.","Sometimes I can be distracted by the glamour and the fabulousness.","I'm a good girl because I really believe in love, integrity, and respect.","I sacrifice in my love life and my social life, but those things will be there in three or four years. This is a really important time in my life. I can't just be the girl who sang 'I Kissed a Girl.' I have to leave a legacy.","I just like having fun.","I'm not going to be everything to everyone.","When I first started out, I was really attracted to having my own sense of style because I started swing dancing, lindy hop, and jitterbug.","Fame is, I think, just a disgusting by-product of what I do.","I wanted to be that quirky girl who writes funny songs that still have meaning.","I'd never devote a whole record to heartbreak.","I have a second chance on life.","My singing is really important to me, but when children come along they'll be my main focus. I'd never put my career in front of my babies - it'd be a case of fitting jobs around them.","My parents were strict, but it was the world I lived in. I had no idea there was a world outside.","I don't follow trends. I'm just not into what everyone else is wearing. I have my own look, which I call 'Lolita Meets Old Hollywood Glam.'","I don't believe in a heaven or a hell or an old man sitting on a throne. I believe in a higher power bigger than me because that keeps me accountable.","My mother is very emotional as well, but my dad is more of the guts of the family. He was the main preacher, so he kind of had this little Pentecostal flair, but they are born-again.","I always knew I wanted a great man of God, someone who was going to be an inspiration for people and also be a lovely husband and father.","If you are not happy with something, you should change it. So I went to a lot of therapy, and finally, I am able to speak up for myself: You are going to hear me roar!","I write my songs because I've lived them.","I think we're all blessed with gifts and I was lucky I just found out what mine was early on and have planted that seed and tried to water it every day.","Honey, I am the chief of my train. If critics want to hop on board, fantastic. There's plenty of room. The KP train is fun.","I'm okay with having bad dance moves. I'm okay with having horrible lower teeth. That's what makes me me, and for some reason it's worked out all right.","Everyone related to me in my circle was from church: church friends, church school, church activities. All my friends weren't allowed to watch MTV or go to PG-13 movies or listen to the radio, so I didn't really know anything different. That's how I was raised.","I think that parents grow up with an idea of what they want their kids to be like - and then their kids grow up to be people of themselves, of their own.","I gave myself until I turned 25 to make it. And if it didn't happen, I thought I'd just try to find a nice husband.","At my second record label, they told me and other female artists that some of us were going on the chopping block. I was 19... and it was devastating.","It was so draining. Going to parties to rub elbows with so-and-so and act like it's no big deal, when really all I was doing was hoping I'd have the success they had.","I'm not defined by where I came from. I never took part in the rules and hatred that sometimes go along with religion. But if my parents are happy with what they believe, then I'm happy to stay out of their way. We agree to disagree.","My career is like an artichoke. People might think that the leaves are tasty and buttered up and delicious, and they don't even know that there's something magical hidden at the base of it. There's a whole other side of me that people didn't know existed.","I didn't have a childhood.","I have always been the kid who's asked 'Why?' In my faith, you're just supposed to have faith. But I was always like 'why?'","The press is just not your friend when it comes to a marriage. That's why we didn't sell the pictures of our wedding, and we got offered millions of dollars for them, millions.","I think sometimes when children grow up, their parents grow up. Mine grew up with me. We coexist. I don't try to change them anymore, and I don't think they try to change me. We agree to disagree.","I have multipersonality disorder - in a very good way, of course - when it comes to my fashion choices.","I feel really blessed because of where I come from.","My parents are very quirky, eccentric. They have their own world.","People don't want just vanilla. They want 31 flavors. I couldn't do what Rihanna does. I couldn't do what Gaga does. They can't do what I do.","I've lived such a great, fantastic life already, but there's still so much more.","I was a hop-around. I hung out with the rockabilly crew, the guys who were trying to be rappers, the funny kids.","If people want a role model, they can have Miley Cyrus.","I got this Jesus tattoo on my wrist when I was 18 because I know that it's always going to be a part of me. When I'm playing, it's staring right back at me, saying, 'Remember where you came from.'","I've done a lot of bad things. Use your imagination.","I think people appreciate a songwriter who shows different sides. The whole angst thing is cool, but if that's all you've got, it's just boring. Everything I write, whether it's happy or sad, has a sense of humor to it.","I'm really critical of my posture, it makes a big difference. And I try to suck my belly in. Everyone should do that whether you're on a red carpet or not. Even if you're just going out to dinner with your boyfriend you should try and suck it in.","My dad would give me $10, which is a lot of money when you're 9, to sing at church, on tables at restaurants, at family functions, just about anywhere.","I'm kind of a more sunshiny person myself.","I grew up not really having anything, so the idea that I can take care of my family and my friends now is a really cool bonus.","I just want to make it very clear that I come from very humble beginnings, and I worked for everything!","I've actually always wanted to make something like an acoustic record.","I'm a woman who likes to be courted - strongly.","You have to spend a lot to make a lot. It's not like I'm sitting on top of a pile of money.","I never live in the present. I'd do interviews and people will say, 'Isn't this great?' or 'Can you believe?' And I would react, like, 'No, I can't believe it because I'm not living in this moment.'","I just have so much love for my record label.","I still have a spiritual base and a spiritual foundation.","Not to sound overly cheesy but I really appreciate the freedom we have in America - especially as a female.","I like a good boy, but sometimes you get bored.","Hollywood is so fake and people need to realize that people are just people, and you, too, don't need to be born into something or have money or have whatever product someone is hawking on you.","I still believe in love, most definitely. I'm just going to let that take the lead.","I love those documentaries where everyone is fabulous and always perfect.","I've always been ambitious since I was nine years old and that was never going to change.","There are times I go out and meet people and flirt, but it's not really appropriate to have anything serious.","I still want to be as approachable and relatable as possible - when I meet fans and they're crying, I'll say, 'Calm down, there's nothing to cry about.'","If you like my music, great, and if you don't, whatever. I'm going to keep making it either way.","I'm okay with having bad dance moves.","I'm okay with having horrible lower teeth.","Ever since I was younger I wanted to be on stage, singing my songs in a glittering costume. And that happened and is still happening. I have to remember that this is what I wished for and be grateful because there are 500 other girls right behind me that are ready to snatch it up.","When I decide to become a mother I will just be that. That will be really important to me.","I came from a lot of intolerance and prejudice, which aren't necessarily healthy to evolve as a human.","I am so grateful for all the love and support I've had from people around the world.","I can't just be the girl who sang 'I Kissed a Girl.' I have to leave a legacy.","I don't have a Kate Moss body, but I'm very proud and happy with mine.","I was never really attached to a clique, and I wanted to be in all the different groups; I was never a one-group kind of person. I think that's still part of my personality today.","I never want to be just one thing - I want to be multidimensional.","I think that you should definitely listen to what people say, because everyone says it: High school is not the real world.","My whole thing is to agree to disagree and to have respect because nothing can really be changed and you wouldn't want to ruin their happiness - even if that happiness is ignorance.","Unfortunately, I think a lot of people are affected more by the idea of fame than the actual work ethic involved. A lot of them just want to be reality TV-type people who don't do anything.","Even if you actually have the good intent to do something creative or special with your life, it's hard. I mean, look at the number of people who actually get the opportunity.","I think sometimes when children grow up, their parents grow up. Mine grew up with me. We coexist. I don't try to change them anymore, and I don't think they try to change me.","I'm on this extraordinary adventure, and if I have no one to talk to at the end of the night, I feel lonely.","The media tried to destroy my parents and has taken things completely out of context, but there's not a whole lot you can do in terms of fighting back. You have to hope that it passes, which it always does. But they have to be careful. They didn't necessarily sign up for this.","I got a fantastic person to work me out and get me into really good shape.","I'm going to let love lead the way, always. And I was born with this blind - blind ambition, and it's kind of gotten me here to this point. And I think that I'll stick to it.","I'm either going to go completely mental, completely bankrupt, or have the best success of my life.","I want to sell out arenas and sell millions of records.","You look at someone like Beyonce singing 'Single Ladies,' when we all know she's married. Some of it is just for entertainment.","I'll continue to try and balance like a circus act. And I will just fight to always tell the truth. Even if it's difficult.","I'm okay if everything is honest and truthful and relatable. If it's fabricated and ill-motived, it's not good.","I don't want to completely self-sabotage everything that I've got and alienate everyone. But I definitely want to take some chances as I always have.","With songs, I've always pledged to be honest. I write my songs because I've lived them.","I came from a different mind-set growing up, and my mind has changed."],"Kaui Hart Hemmings":["Hawaii is so complex; there are so many points of view, and there are so many experiences to see and to find.","Writing has never been like therapy for me, but blogging comes a little closer - I can smack-talk freely and frequently, and this is good for me.","When you're a child, you crave formal recognition; you crave ceremony, celebration, certification of proof.","When a place comes across vividly in a novel, it's often compared to a character. I can remember writing teachers who encouraged me to treat setting as if it were a character, to give it three dimensions, to make it come alive, jump off the page.","I like to add props to render the specificities of place - paintings, food, clothing, signs, infrastructure, music, sayings and slang particular to the region and particular to the character. And props shouldn't just sit there; they should get used.","Tragedy brings change, and that's what I'm interested in most - how people plunge into change and try to fight, then eventually move with it with grace.","I felt like I haven't had the typical experience of a novelist whose book becomes a movie.","Two days a week, I go to my office at The Grotto, a writer's collective in San Francisco. I get there at 8:15 and write until around 1 or 2 P.M.","I try to think of it not as writer's block, but a time where you just need to live life and experience things so you have something to write about.","After college, I moved to Breckenridge, Colorado, and went snowboarding every day. I didn't know what I wanted to do, but I knew what I didn't want to do. So I applied to grad school for writing, and I just gave it a shot and took it from there.","The beauty of cinema is that it can do some things that novels just can't.","I always felt a little bit of an outsider, especially because I grew up on Oahu.","I'm proud of being from Hawaii, and I'm proud of being Hawaiian, but I'm more than that, too.","I love film and have taken a stab at a screenplay. I love writing dialogue and found it highly enjoyable.","I like to work out every day, so that takes up some time.","I can't speak for all Hawaiians, but the reality is that we depend on tourism. Locals might not want to go to the spots like Waikiki, but we do want tourists to experience more of the islands.","Disney's Aulani Resort has really developed the southwest coast of Oahu and led to it getting more attention.","My seven-year-old daughter knows old songs and how the neighborhoods got their names. There are little things: Businesses receive blessings from Hawaiian priests before opening, and everyone's kids have their debut luau. You can't really get through a day without doing something Hawaiian.","People go surfing before work and paddling afterward. My husband is from Wisconsin, and he goes to work in his Hawaiian shirt.","The best thing about being a fiction writer is that where the truth is inconvenient, I could veer away.","The entire island knows our father, Fred Hemmings, Jr. - kids, adults, surfers, the governor, grocery clerks, gang members who call our house at night and threaten to kill us as soon as they get out of jail. Fred was a world-champion surfer and is now a well-known, controversial politician.","With families, no matter what kind you inherit, at some point you want to announce that you belong to it.","For my 11th birthday, I asked to be adopted.","I loved 'Belzhar' by Meg Wolitzer.","Jonathan Franzen seems like the grumpiest guy, and he doesn't seem to like much of anything, so I really don't care what he has to say.","It's useless to criticize things that people love and something that speaks to them.","What's great about teen fiction is that it's all mixed up - there's highbrow and lowbrow!","In putting setting to work, I like to think about long shots and close-ups. The long shot is the overall view of the place in which the characters live - the island, the town, the wide sweep of place. Then we narrow in. The close-up, the tight focus, makes the place different from anywhere else.","Setting shouldn't just consist of describing nature or a landscape, or of saying where something takes place. It is the world of specific people. It's not enough for it to feel vivid or credible; it should feel necessary.","I've never gone back to the stacks after my book's expiration at the front of the store. Not because I'm above it or anything, but I'd be mortified if someone caught me looking for my own book.","I just try to write what I think would really happen, and with grief and tragedy, there are these naturally occurring moments of levity and humor and absurdity. I think that's what life is really like. Sadness gets interrupted, and happiness gets interrupted.","Especially when I write, I want to get out of people's heads and have them speak and have them get dressed and have them go to work.","I feel like having details from their day and having a plot and action and things to do is much more revealing than having a character sitting and thinking to themselves. When I'm writing, I want people to actually have a goal, something that's dragging them forward.","I wasn't creative enough to imagine my first novel becoming a film directed by Alexander Payne. Nor did I consider the possibility of seeing Hollywood stars moving through my personal version of Hanalei town: going to Tahiti Nui, rehearsing a scene in front of my cousin's cottages, driving the snaky roads.","One day during filming, George Clooney was wearing his surf shirt and board shorts, and my six-year-old daughter was in the background as an extra, playing in the sand - playing herself. She and Clooney suddenly looked equally Hawaiian, equally related to the place I call home.","Nothing has changed that much, even during filmmaking for 'The Descendants.' I wrote. I took the kids to school. I cleaned the house. And I had dinner with George Clooney.","Sometimes I loved the disruptive student in class who livened up lectures with wisecracks - it put a spin on things, added flavor, made me laugh. Other times, I wished the heckler would just shut up so I could learn something."],"Kavita Ramdas":["Feminism, unlike almost every other social movement, is not a struggle against a distinct oppressor - it's not the ruling class or the occupiers or the colonizers - it's against a deeply held set of beliefs and assumptions that we women, far too often, hold ourselves.","With few exceptions, the leading women in philanthropy, notably Melinda Gates, are the wives or daughters of rich and powerful men.","People with lower incomes tend to give a greater percentage of their incomes to help others and show greater empathy and compassion - perhaps because they know they might face the same circumstances.","I work for the Global Fund for Women, an organization that is actively supporting women's rights groups in 160 countries around the world."],"Kawhi Leonard":["I'm just a low-key guy.","I'm always trying to come down with a win. That's what matters to me and my squad.","I like being the underdog so they don't expect what's going to happen. It pushes me to work harder and do the things I'm not doing better.","It's an honor to have been considered for the team, and I hope that in the future I will have the chance to represent my country by playing for U.S.A. Basketball.","I'll never try to win an award. I'm out there just playing for my team.","When I'm on the court, I feel all problems go away.","I want the kids to know that it's not a myth that somebody from their city plays and wins in the NBA. I just want to influence them to work hard and do whatever they want to do in life, whether it's to be a basketball player or scientist... if they believe in themselves, they can do anything.","I played basketball when I was little because it was fun for me. It still is now. I just love it. I have a passion for it.","I just want to keep improving, to keep getting better.","I'm just the same guy... I don't need to be a celebrity or a superstar.","Winning is motivation.","I'm just living in the moment, trying to win every game. That's all I'm focused on.","There's nothing to be scared of. We're playing basketball. The only thing that could happen is you failing. But as long as you're going hard, there's nothing to be scared of for me. I don't know what there is to be scared of.","I could have gone to a bigger school. I use it as motivation going to a school that loved me. I wanted to put them on the map and show everyone that you don't need to go to a top school to make it in the NBA.","I'm not one of the guys in the league for the fame. I'm here so I can take of my family, my mom, my friends and take care of myself.","The Spurs are a great organization.","As long as you give your best effort, I feel like that's all you can do.","It was a great feeling to be named an All-Star starter, to know that my hard work is paying off and fans around the world are recognizing that.","My mindset is the same every game.","I've always liked home-cooked meals.","I definitely don't like to eat a lot before I play. I don't like to play on a full stomach. Sometimes, if I'm feeling hungry before a game, I'll eat one of those protein bars, but that's it.","I rarely eat breakfast because of our schedule, actually. If I do, though, I'll try to do an egg-white omelet with some bell peppers and mushrooms. Maybe a side of a bunch of different fruits.","I don't eat the same meal or at the same time every single day. You get tired of that real quick. I just try to make sure whatever I'm eating is fresh and clean and good for my body. That's about it.","I don't like to bring attention to myself. I don't like to make a scene.","I could be on the court for two hours, and it felt like 10 minutes. It made time go by.","That's how I grew up. Just play defense - and make a basket.","I look at film, but more than watching individual players, I'm trying to watch a team's whole offensive scheme. I'm trying to know their tendencies so I can... guess. That's what it comes down to, really, making the best guess.","Not all water is great for you. I drink a lot of water during the day, but I stay away from certain waters because their pH levels are low. Stick to alkaline waters with a higher pH. Trust me.","It's all mental. I just have to worry about my game.","I try to come in with a focus to stop my man and win the game. I'm always trying to be ready to catch them off their strides by being physical enough without getting fouls.","My motivation wasn't really to get a $95 million contract, you know?","I'm not out here just for the money. I want to be a great player.","You definitely see a difference in some guys' games when they do get paid. I'm trying to make sure I'm not that player.","I'm just trying to pass Tim Duncan in championships if I can one day. That's my motivation; that's what I strive for. Tim is one of the greatest players who has ever played, so if I could get close or reach that plateau and have my name on that list.","I'm trying to see what way I could lead so when the opportunity comes, it won't just hit me in the face.","Oh man, I like Chevys.","I like the old-school muscle cars.","I'm never trying to break a career high out there.","Coming to a team like the Spurs, you're automatically going to learn how to play the game the right way.","I'm trying to be one of the greatest players, so whatever level that consists of is where I want to take my game.","Everybody in the NBA works on their game. I just tried to follow that lead when I was in high school, college - and now.","I'm just happy that people like the way I play.","It's just the game itself that drives me. I just want to be able to compete at a high level.","My dad leaving my life. That's the biggest thing that happened to me. I just remember what he tells me, the memories, and try to move on forward each day, knowing that he's still here, looking down on me.","When I was growing up, I didn't have a hometown hero.","When I'm away from basketball, I hang out with my friends, chill, and that's about it.","It's how I've been playing my whole life, guarding the best player on the other team.","My hands make me a little longer, and that's always a good thing.","People always want to compare their hands to mine. Pretty much everywhere I go.","Coming in, I wanted to be a great player, and right now at the beginning of my career, I'm showing some slight sunshine that I can be the player I want.","I just have to move forward and keep working on my game and getting better.","I know people are going to put the main focus on stopping me, so I need to learn how to make my teammates better by passing and creating opportunities for them.","I'm just playing basketball. I just want to be a great player. That's it. That's all I'm thinking about. If the other stuff comes, it comes, but I'm just fortunate to play in the NBA Finals and just to play basketball, period.","I want to play against the best, and that's what I'm doing, just going out there and being focused, just competing every possession.","I was good. I probably could have gone to the NFL. I just hated practice.","People in the NBA are just as athletic as you. That's the game. You have to have the change of pace. You have to change speeds to get around people.","Playing football helped me a lot. Just reading the quarterback's eyes and reading receivers, figuring out what they want to do.","I always wanted to play both ends of the floor. I never wanted to be one-dimensional.","Everybody plays back-to-backs.","I work all summer and throughout the whole season to be prepared for the challenges that I have to face.","I don't watch ESPN, don't listen to the radio. I just go home and deal with my family.","Obviously, I like guys that can defend other positions. Draymond Green is doing a great job with Golden State. Jimmy Butler brings it every night when I'm out there.","Tony Allen is a good defender, very smart.","At the end of the day, we all know what the Jordan logo means, and you can't take anything away from that. But it's pretty cool to have my own logo on a Jordan shoe.","I remember being a teenager and watching 40-year-old Michael Jordan compete in his final All-Star game.","Whoever I'm playing against, I go in and try to stop their best scorer and try to get myself going on the offensive end.","You just go out there and try to compete and try to make a play for your teammates.","I just try to play every game like it's Game 7 of the NBA Finals.","I didn't work out with Kobe. I don't know where that came from. I wish I could have.","I'm just here to play basketball and have fun and try to win another championship.","I can't be impatient. It would show on the floor, and I won't compete if I'm thinking about getting the ball.","I'm just going out there to do my role, the same role - defense first - and then see how the ball turns out on the offensive end.","It's definitely fun when you're able to translate your practice into the game. It's fun, and you know that your hard work paid off.","I'm just happy that I get the opportunity to do the things on the court that I do in practice.","The bigs are there on the help-side if the guy goes by me, and I'm able to switch to other offensive players.","I just think repetition and getting the game reps shooting the ball in games really helps, rather than just practicing. You can get game timing.","If I get noticed for my individual performance, that's what happens. Other than that, I'm just trying to win the game.","If I can get back and win a championship, that's what I'm trying to do.","I love the game of basketball, and as long as I can do that, keep playing and try to get some more championships with the organization, I'll be happy.","I don't care about winning an MVP - the MVP doesn't mean you're the best player in the league.","People would ask what college are you going to, and I'd say, 'San Diego State.' And they'd say, 'Why?'","Everything outside doesn't matter when I'm on the court; it's just me and nothing else. Family problems, school, what happened to my father, all the stress goes away.","I believed I could play in the NBA.","It's just a great feeling, once you have a child.","I've been working hard to be one of the focal points in the NBA, one of the top guys.","I've got to learn how to create shots for others."],"Kay Bailey Hutchison":["When I became the first woman to represent the state of Texas in the United State Senate, it was with the help of a lot of women - and a large number of men, too.","The traditional role of the Senate has been to be the adult in the room.","I am proud of the President's leadership. I am proud to support him in saying: Yes, we are going to do what is necessary now when it is less painful and less expensive.","Our country was hit on 9/11, 2001. Everybody in the world knows that. It hasn't been easy to deal with a different kind of enemy, but that is what we have, a different kind of enemy.","Well, I think that it's clear that the Republican Party is a pro-life party. And we do value life. And we do believe that the unborn have a right to life.","When it comes to dividing Americans on the basis of their gender, I know a little something about the subject.","I have long believed taxpayers make better use of their money than the government ever could.","People can't imagine an enemy that would cut someone's head off before a video camera and spread it out across the world. But that has happened with the kind of enemy we are now facing.","Our country also hungers for leadership to ensure the long-term survival of our Social Security system. With 70 million baby boomers in this country on the verge of retirement, we need to take action to shore up the system.","We are battling fanatics who kidnap and behead civilians and shoot fleeing children in the back. There can be no dialogue with such people, and the American people understand this.","There are elections in which everyone knows that 'the people have spoken' but they don't always know exactly what the people have said. This November's election was different. Not only did the people speak, they spoke clearly.","Texans should not be taxed on our taxes.","The important thing is that we recognize our President's leadership, that he is not saying: I am going to walk away from this. He is saying: I am going to do the right thing.","We can be proud of our record as an international beacon of liberty. From fostering democracies in Eastern Europe to the stabilization of Iraq and Afghanistan, we have been true to that calling and helped spread freedom to oppressed peoples everywhere.","I grew up in a time when many people believed that men and women should not always be treated equally.","My dad was a workaholic. I saw him work seven days a week.","Saying you're from Texas makes you kind of proud.","Cheerleading gave me a love of sports, which I brought to the Senate. I can talk to the good ol' boys about college sports because I follow it like they do.","I do think women generally are more humble.","Unfortunately because of the variety of outlets for people to speak their minds on the Internet and that kind of thing, it's made the media in general more opinionated and there's more of a 'gotcha mentality' than real reporting.","We cannot afford to lose the Medicaid funding for low-income women.","I want to thank the people of Texas for asking me to represent them in Washington.","Congress suffers a great deal of criticism for its partisan acrimony. But while we may disagree politically, and air our opposition in this chamber, it is the conversation behind the scenes that cements and defines our relationships.","I have always been able to rise above the expectations.","Congress can't take the year off, election or no election.","I just don't see anonymous sources as fair against a candidate. I think if someone has a real concern, they should come out and say it.","In my opinion governors don't make the best presidents. That's my opinion and it's because they don't have the foreign policy experience and they have to learn on the job.","I am not a moderate. I am a conservative. I'm a fix-it conservative.","I think when you've been in office for a long time, you have a record, and that record is fair game."],"Kay Cannon":["On the set of 'Girlboss,' I had to keep introducing myself as the show runner - literally, 'Hi, I'm the boss' - to a lot of my crew. My first AD said, 'Why do you keep doing that?' I said, 'Because I get mistaken for an extra.'","When I was younger, I wanted my hair to look like Molly Ringwald's.","I love that feeling, that feeling of team.","I didn't set out to write some female-empowering movie; I just wanted to write a funny college comedy.","I'm a huge fan of Ace of Base. 'The Sign?' I love that song.","I wake up around seven, and I give my daughter breakfast. I spend the first hour or two of her day with her.","We're big 'Game of Thrones' fans, so we call our house King's Landing. I have a studio apartment above our garage that we call Winterfell. I go to Winterfell to write.","On '30 Rock,' the hours were really intense, and I was often on set. I'm glad I didn't have a kid then because I don't think I would have ever seen her. I would work 15-hour days, and weekends, too.","When I was in college, I started an improv group, and I did a bunch of plays and some musicals. I have a theater degree. I'm a school person: I like getting homework and having deadlines. When I graduated, I worked right away as an actor.","I was a writer on '30 Rock' for six years.","I played volleyball and basketball, and I did track and volleyball in college.","I was in relays for track where you just bonded with all these different kinds of personalities who were coming together for this one common goal of beating a rival team.","I was an athlete, so I have kind of an athletic sensibility towards writing. I can work for many long hours without fatiguing.","No one ever actually said they were resistant because 'Pitch Perfect' was female-centric. When a project is sitting there for a while, you start to speculate about what could be the thing that might be a little tricky about it.","'Pitch Perfect' was my first screenplay, so it was like my little baby.","Ultimately, I want to direct a movie, so that's another thing, too, where I wonder what that will look like and how will I be able to manage.","I was auditioning a lot in L.A., and I was actually getting called back a lot for sitcoms. But I wasn't getting jobs. I even tested for 'Saturday Night Live' and didn't get that.","I was like, 'I have to start writing for myself, to show people what I can do and what my point of view is.'","I was working at 'New Girl' when I found out there was going to be a 'Pitch' sequel.","I would be writing while I was breastfeeding. I didn't want the computer to be too close to her, so it was at an arm's distance away while I was clickety-clack typing away.","I ran track in college. And that team, that all-lady team that I was on, I can remember just being so incredibly sad that I knew we were all going to leave each other after we graduated and that our lives would change. And even though I was the bridesmaid at all their weddings and stuff like that, it's just not the same, right?","You never imagine that the Green Bay Packers were going to be in something you wrote or singing 'Bootylicious.'","You just tell a good story where you're funny and it makes people laugh.","I'm actually from a small town about an hour and a half south of Chicago.","I have to say, my husband is a big Patriots fan. Like, a huge Patriots fan.","'Hot Pursuit,' 'Pitch Perfect 2,' 'Trainwreck,' and 'Spy' were all being done in the last year. All four of those movies I just mentioned are not rom-coms: they're all about women doing different things.","I started writing because I wasn't getting things as an actor.","I wasn't, like, pretty enough to be the ingenue; I wasn't 'character' enough to be the goofball sidekick. I'm kind of ethnically ambiguous.","I've got to literally write my own ticket.","I took a class at The Second City, and it became contagious.","I saturated myself with the improv community.","It's interesting: when you're kind of 'known' for being a writer, people don't think you've done anything else.","I started writing for myself because I know how to write for myself. I know how to show what I can do.","When I finished grad school, I moved to Chicago proper, and I was at all the different improv schools, taking classes or interning.","I was crazy poor, but I was learning and putting myself out there and getting hired to do whatever gig I could and auditioning.","Second City Las Vegas is very different from Second City in Chicago on the main stage, where they do improv sets. That's how they kind of hone material, kind of work up to new material.","I loved all the people involved with '30 Rock.'","I started writing when I was trying to be an actor, and I happened to be friends with Tina Fey, who happened to have her show '30 Rock' coming out. So Tina, who happens to be a mentor to me, gave me my slot and hired me.","I feel like the guilds are, just to be frank, people I pay money to.","'Bridesmaids,' I think, opened up a door to allow women to show a bunch of different women in different ways of being funny. It was kind of like an arrival moment.","Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, they made it cool to be funny and to be embarrassed and to look a thousand different ways and show a bunch of different areas of their lives.","There's still only maybe three female writers or two female writers to 10 guys in any kind of writer's room.","I like it when adult straight men are big fans of 'Pitch Perfect!'","We have a lot of depressed people in the world because they don't know what their purpose is in life.","People try to make women a very specific thing so that we like them.","Society has this deeply rooted love of seeing women fail.","Even if I wrote 'The Kay Cannon Show,' I would have to audition to play Kay Cannon. And I probably wouldn't get it.","I was the runt of the family, the shortest and the smallest, so I think they perceived me as the one who was like, 'Look at me!' - just trying to get their attention and being a goofball.","Everything that makes us who we are is A-O.K.","It's not about having luck; it's about putting yourself in a position of luck.","Tina Fey is my mentor, whether she likes it or not.","Tell your daughters and their daughters that if they want to be a firewoman, they can be a firewoman. If they want to be an astronaut, they can be an astronaut. If they want to run their own business or run for president, they can do whatever they put their mind to.","I felt that a cappella was the improv world with music, where it's very serious, and there are groups and competition, and some people become famous, and there's a language we speak from one improviser to another.","I've seen 'Bring It On,' like, a thousand times.","Writers who sit down and write might judge what they're putting down, but I always just try to barf it out. I'm writing crap, but I'll put it down."],"Kay Granger":["Human rights are not a privilege granted by the few, they are a liberty entitled to all, and human rights, by definition, include the rights of all humans, those in the dawn of life, the dusk of life, or the shadows of life.","Having removed the dictator, the allies have moved to put Iraqis in control of Iraq. Now, as they draft and ratify their Constitution, we will indeed see the character of a new Iraqi nation revealed through the principles it chooses to uphold.","In responding to a terrorist attack, there are only two choices - take the fight to the enemy or wait until they hit you again. In my estimation, America chose the first.","Bottoms line: terrorists are always at work.","The blame for the 9/11 attacks lays squarely and exclusively with the Al-Qaeda network.","It has been said that a nation reveals its character by the values it upholds.","I reached a time in college when I didn't know what I wanted to do. At that time, women's careers were essentially nursing, secretarial and teaching. My mother advised me to get my teacher's certificate.","I lived in Meadowbrook. I went to church at Meadowbrook United Methodist Church. I went to school at Meadowbrook Elementary School and then Meadowbrook Middle School. I learned to dance at Meadowbrook Country Club. All those things grounded me in one place and I think most of Fort Worth is just like the area I grew up in.","I started selling insurance in 1979 and continued doing that until 1985 when I opened my own insurance firm.","It was while starting my business that I saw my first glimpse of government's impact on business."],"Kay Hagan":["The fabric of North Carolina and what makes our state so special is our families and our common desire for a brighter future for our children. No matter what your family looks like, we all want the same thing for our families - happiness, health, prosperity, a bright future for our children and grandchildren.","My faith guides my life.","I need to be looking at what's important in North Carolina, and you better believe that's what I will do.","I want to look at the whole package, but I definitely want to protect the middle-class taxpayer, first and foremost.","I'm up for re-election in 2014, and yes I do plan to run for re-election.","Well, I believe in God. I taught Sunday school.","After much thought and prayer, I have come to my own personal conclusion that we shouldn't tell people who they can love or who they can marry.","Religious institutions should have religious freedom on this issue. No church or minister should ever have to conduct a marriage that is inconsistent with their religious beliefs. But I think as a civil institution, this issue's time has come and we need to move forward.","North Carolina is strong because our people are strong. They define our state - by their hard work, commitment to their families and neighbors, their willingness to sacrifice so that their children can have a chance to forge their own path.","For too long, Americans have fallen victim to financial abuses at the hands of predatory lenders that operate in the shadows.","North Carolina is home to some of the largest financial institutions in the country, and a vibrant network of community banks. We're a banking state, and we're proud of that distinction. But we also understand that responsible financial regulation protects consumers and businesses.","We in Congress need to do everything possible to encourage and cultivate small businesses, so that they can expand and create jobs. Far too often, however, U.S. small businesses are impeded by government paperwork and bureaucratic red tape.","The Small Business 'common app' would function much like the one that students complete to apply to multiple colleges and universities simultaneously. It would ensure that small businesses across the country can concentrate on growing and creating jobs - not wasting time, filling out mountains of repetitive paperwork.","People like Elizabeth Dole have given too much power to the special interests.","I want to use every tool in the toolbox that's at our disposal to help our economy and put people back to work."],"Kay Lenz":["On my 30th birthday, all the presents I got were boxes of food. That's what I needed.","I'm a loner. I like to hide a lot."],"Kay Panabaker":["If you're going to think mean things about me or not be a true friend, then we don't need to be friends.","I've actually always wanted to be able to read people's minds. My sister did a movie with super-powers and that's the one I would have wanted, so I really lucked out. The negative is that people are really cruel in their own minds, but you can weed out the bad people from the good people, and then just hang out with the good people.","I'm on my own now. I have my own apartment.","It's rough being a teenager in this day and age.","You can't be crazy and wild when you're on work time. But, I like it, in that sense I think it makes you a better person for having matured at a younger age.","My whole thing is I want to have a backup plan because maybe I won't get another acting job after 'Fame', maybe I'll want to give up on acting in five years or whatever and I want to have something else that I enjoy just as much as I enjoy acting.","I spend so much time with my parents. My mom and I were joined at the hip for five years. There was not one moment when I wasn't with her.","My whole thing is that often times when teenagers are about 18, 19, 20, 21, they get this mentality that they have to be old, they have to appear older, they can no longer be seen as a high schooler, they need to be seen as mid-20s all of a sudden even though they're only, like, 20. I'm the opposite of that.","I went to go see 'Final Destination' which you have to be 17 and over to see and they're like 'Uh, we need to see your I.D.' Here's the really funny thing is that I actually had done my hair and makeup that day. If I don't do my hair and makeup I can understand it but I had actually made an effort to look older.","I have a really hard time watching my sister act in anything but especially anything where it's a strong emotion. Whether she's crying or she's angry or she's - whatever emotion she's feeling I actually think that she's feeling it and I want to hug her and make it all better.","I just feel like I haven't grown up yet. I live on my own and I do grown-up things, but there is something about me that is very youthful.","I can't age on the inside, and I'm totally okay with that. I have no need to grow up and see myself as mature.","Some people do need to grow up, but I don't think I'm there yet. I don't think I'm ready to do grown-up things and be a grown-up."],"Kay Rala Xanana Gusmao":["Freedom goes hand-in-hand with mutual respect.","It is not enough to receive support, no matter, how needed it may be. It is fundamental to know how to receive this support and ensure that its result is exponential.","After so much suffering, after enduring so much sacrifice, sanctioned and embraced by our people, what is it that the people of East Timor expect as a result of independence?","I believe that when people have an occupation that allows them to provide for their families, the social dimension of human nature will emerge instinctively and lead people to help and organize others less privileged."],"Kay Redfield Jamison":["Moods are complicated and very much a part of who we are. People would be very boring without them.","I think one thing is that anybody who's had to contend with mental illness - whether it's depression, bipolar illness or severe anxiety, whatever - actually has a fair amount of resilience in the sense that they've had to deal with suffering already, personal suffering.","People respond differently to people who are grieving. They reach out. But depression is so very isolating. It's hard to explain to anyone who has never been depressed how isolating it is. Grief comes and goes, but depression is unremitting.","Confidentiality is an ancient and well-warranted social value.","When public figures remain silent about depression, there is a cost to the rest of society. Silence contributes to the misperception that successful people do not get depressed, and it keeps the public from seeing that treatment allows many individuals to return to competitive professional lives.","I am one of millions who have been treated for depression and gotten well; I was lucky enough to have a psychiatrist well versed in using lithium and knowledgeable about my illness, and who was also an excellent psychotherapist.","I love animals, and I was always attracted to the idea of being a zoo veterinarian or a veterinarian with the circus.","Grief is so human, and it hits everyone at one point or another, at least, in their lives. If you love, you will grieve, and that's just given.","I believe that curiosity, wonder and passion are defining qualities of imaginative minds and great teachers; that restlessness and discontent are vital things; and that intense experience and suffering instruct us in ways that less intense emotions can never do.","Lithium prevents my seductive but disastrous highs, diminishes my depressions, clears out the wool and webbing from my disordered thinking, slows me down, gentles me out, keeps me from ruining my career and relationships, keeps me out of a hospital, alive, and makes psychotherapy possible.","Lithium remains the gold standard, but many drugs now treat bipolar disorder. Medication is critical and should be combined with psychotherapy. Compliance is a major problem. Patients believe that once they're better, they no longer need the medication. It doesn't work that way.","When I'm talking about depression, I'm talking about the more severe forms of depression, and I think that conceptualising as a form of grief is probably not the most effective way of looking at it. I mean, at the end of the day, people suffer enormously, and you want to treat it.","Nothing good comes out of depression.","There is no common standard for education about diagnosis. Distinguishing between bipolar depression and major depressive disorder, for example, can be difficult, and mistakes are common. Misdiagnosis can be lethal. Medications that work well for some forms of depression induce agitation in others.","It is an odd thing, owing life to pills, one's own quirks and tenacities, and this unique, strange, and ultimately profound relationship called psychotherapy.","With grief, you have reason to despair; it's a human thing.","I have had manic-depressive illness, also known as bipolar disorder, since I was 18 years old. It is an illness that ensures that those who have it will experience a frightening, chaotic and emotional ride. It is not a gentle or easy disease.","Grief comes and goes, but depression is unremitting.","Knowledge is marvelous, but wisdom is even better.","I say I'm an academic: a professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins. And I write.","People talk about grief as if it's kind of an unremittingly awful thing, and it is. It is painful, but it's a very, very interesting sort of thing to go through, and it really helps you out. At the end of the day, it gets you through because you have to reform your relationship, and you have to figure out a way of getting to the future.","It is important to value intellect and discipline, of course, but it is also important to recognize the power of irrationality, enthusiasm and vast energy.","Mania is as bad as it gets. If not treated, it will become worse, more frequent, and harder to treat.","Scientists have made extraordinary advances in understanding the brain and its disorders.","Psychotherapy is a sanctuary; it is a battleground; it is a place I have been psychotic, neurotic, elated, confused, and despairing beyond belief.","No pill can help me deal with the problem of not wanting to take pills; likewise, no amount of psychotherapy alone can prevent my manias and depressions. I need both.","In some cases, some people do get depressed in the middle of their grief, and they really need to be treated for depression.","Never once, during any of my bouts of depression, had I been inclined or able to pick up a telephone and ask a friend for help. It wasn't in me.","Mood disorders are terribly painful illnesses, and they are isolating illnesses. And they make people feel terrible about themselves when, in fact, they can be treated.","One of things so bad about depression and bipolar disorder is that if you don't have prior awareness, you don't have any idea what hit you.","There are a lot of studies that suggest a higher rate of creativity in bipolars than the general population.","We expect well-informed treatment for cancer or heart disease; it matters no less for depression.","Because I teach and write about depression and bipolar illness, I am often asked what is the most important factor in treating bipolar disorder. My answer is competence. Empathy is important, but competence is essential.","There are scientists all around the world looking for the genes responsible for bipolar illness and major depression.","It's more common than not that bipolar illness will start in the teens. One of the reasons I spend a lot of time on college campuses is exactly that reason. It's terribly important to talk to students about knowing these things in advance.","'An Unquiet Mind' wasn't hard to write in terms of the actual writing of it.","You become aware of an illness by understanding yourself and understanding the meaning that that illness has in your own life, symbolically and, more importantly, quite literally.","An intense temperament has convinced me to teach not only from books but from what I have learned from experience. So I try to impress upon young doctors and graduate students that tumultuousness, if coupled to discipline and a cool mind, is not such a bad sort of thing.","Several politicians and wives of politicians have been public about their experiences with depression or bipolar illness, including Lawton Chiles, Patrick Kennedy, Tipper Gore and Kitty Dukakis. Each made a tremendous difference by doing so.","A possible link between 'madness' and genius is one of the oldest and most persistent of cultural notions.","Psychologists, for reasons of clinical necessity or vagaries of temperament, have chosen to dissect and catalog the morbid emotions - depression, anger, anxiety - and to leave largely unexamined the more vital, positive ones."],"Kay Robertson":["Robertsons love Sundays! The most important thing we do is gather together with our church family for worship, teaching, and fellowship. After church, we like to have a nice lunch of roast, vegetables, and definitely rolls or biscuits. And I love catching a nap when I can.","I tell my kids and my grandkids, 'Never forget where you came from. Never forget your roots.' My grandkids, they didn't go through the hard times as much as other ones in our family did. One thing is to just never forget where you came from and you never forget that nothing is more important than your relationship with Jesus Christ.","I think America needs us. 'Duck Dynasty' has given some hope to bringing the family back. I want to set that example.","My grandmother's house was just a place of comfort. I mean, I remember going in there, and the kitchen always had pots cooking with the lids were always bump, bump, bump, bump, bubbling, you know?","I love my squirrel and dumplings, but you can make it with chicken and dumplings. I love making the dumplings. I think I just like to roll out dough.","You have to fight for your marriage, do whatever it takes. The commitment has to be there. And if you don't have a sense of humor, I don't know how anybody makes it.","One of the great tragedies I see is people not putting every effort into the foundation of their marriage. My grandmother told me that it's one man and one woman for life and that your marriage is worth fighting for.","My kids would come in from school and sit on the floor in front of the TV and line up duck call boxes and put the stickers on the duck call and then put them in the boxes.","Families need to have a time when they can cook together. They can eat at the table and you can look eye-to-eye. Phones are put away and there are no interruptions. And what you do is concentrate on each other. Listen to what they have to say, and let them listen to you."],"Kay Thompson":["You have to eat oatmeal or you'll dry up. Anybody knows that.","I am Eloise. I am six. I am a city child. I live at The Plaza.","Getting bored is not allowed."],"Kaya Scodelario":["I like to have fun. I'm also a bit of the crazy one. All my friends are boys. I was bullied a lot by girls in school. There was also too much drama and demands.","I don't like to make predictions, because my life's been pretty unpredictable so far.","There are so many things that you're supposed to conform to as an actress. Keep your mouth shut. Look pretty. Be a fashionista. I'm not stylish. I don't want to become this character.","I love dressing up, but I do find the red carpet thing quite stressful. When I went to Venice Film Festival last month to promote 'Wuthering Heights,' I told my boyfriend beforehand 'I will be a nightmare, I will cry, I will be nervous.' Actually once I was there, it was fine.","I don't know any women who are one-dimensional, so why would I play one?","When I was growing up, we didn't have much money. What was important in my house was to have food on the table, be happy, and have our family.","People don't realise how dyslexia affects your confidence and how brutal it can be. People think you're dumb, and you know you're not. it's just how your brain works.","I think really good drama comes down to real human emotion. That's what makes us all tick, and that's what I've always been drawn to when it comes to scripts is real human emotion and dealing with that.","I like the idea of up-and-coming actors nowadays being a little different and not necessarily the drama-school stereotype, being a bit more edgy.","I'm not comfortable doing nudity. That's something quite personal.","When someone shouts 'Skins' at you, its funny the first time. But after a hundred times, you think, 'I do have a name.'","The best part about doing 'Wuthering Heights' was you were completely in that world. It could not have been done with CGI. You had to be there.","I'm not a girly girl. I don't brush my hair.","I can't wait to take my son to see 'Wonder Woman' - I can't wait to show him all the female characters can be well-rounded people.","I'd love to find a really good Brazilian project, an up and coming director or something. I wouldn't want to do the typical favela story, Brazilian cinema has a lot more to offer than just that.","I find it easy to act being in love. I've experienced that and analysed it.","My mum has told me that I have to work with Antonio Banderas just so that she can meet him and try and marry him.","It was really cool to work with Dakota Fanning. I've watched her grow up and I've always loved her films, loved her. It was amazing working with someone who was American as well, because obviously it's going to be a different energy straightaway. We got on really well; she's so professional and hardworking.","My mum is Brazilian and very proud. I'd love to do a Brazilian film. I've been brought up in the Brazilian culture. My mum brought me up on my own, I cook Brazilian food, I've never spoken a word of English to my mother.","I would love to make a Brazilian film, but it would have to be something very close to my heart. It's such a personal thing, so I'd want to do my family proud. I'd want to do justice to Brazilian cinema. I think Brazilian cinema is brilliant. I would really love to do something, but I'm just waiting for the right thing.","'Skins' wanted to create a new thing by actually casting real teenagers. I think it was very brave of them. They also wanted to give the opportunity to people who didn't go to drama school.","I'm finding a lot of actors my age now who are a bit more like me, and not as posh or brought up in a certain way. There's now people of all sorts of kinds of backgrounds.","I felt there needed to be a show for teenagers that didn't make them feel judged. 'Skins' never tried to preach. It allowed young people to make their own decisions about what to do and whether it was right or wrong. Young people really respond to that, and that's what sets 'Skins' apart.","I've just made a cancer drama, called 'Now Is Good,' directed by Ol Parker and starring Dakota Fanning. We filmed in Brighton and it's about a girl dying of leukemia, although it's not as depressing as it sounds.","Who doesn't want to shoot for 'Vogue?' I remember updating my Facebook status to say 'Doing 'Vogue' today', it was so exciting. I thought it would be really intimidating, and I don't like photoshoots, but that was the most relaxed one I've done.","Clothes are my drug. I love Camden market - I have so many vintage pieces from there it's unbelievable. Clothes are really important to me, they give me that feeling of happiness. I love being a bit free with it all and not giving myself rules.","I've missed London so much for its fashion. No disrespect to the girls in Manchester, but some really do look like clones - there's a lot of hair extensions and fake tans. You're free to experiment down here.","I was painfully shy as a child; I was dyslexic. I had a single mother who's an immigrant. I just didn't believe acting was something that people like me could do on a professional level.","I remember doing my first school play. We were doing 'Oliver Twist,' and I was cast as Oliver. It was the first time I ever felt brave and confident and truly happy about something.","My mom always let me watch movies that were probably slightly too mature for my age, but she wanted me to see different stories. We grew up with quite a hard life, so she wasn't afraid to show me that in movies.","I'd like to think that even if I wasn't acting professionally, I would still be doing it for free. It helps me get through the day.","In England, there is this tradition of the upper classes going to very expensive drama schools and then going on having careers. I knew that wasn't an option for me. My mother would never have been able to afford that.","I was bullied; I was kind of a girl in the corner. So acting was a great outlet for me by pretending to be someone else.","I got incredibly lucky, and you have to be if you want to be quite successful.","Considering what the 'Fifty Shades of Grey' film is about, I wouldn't be able to play Anastacia.","I think, like every actor, you've just to pick what you're interested in.","Acting's such a good job in that you're stimulating and pushing yourself constantly. I'd never want to do anything comfortable.","I'm the unhealthiest person in the world. I'm not fit at all.","I like working with new and young directors.","I want to play Keith Richards.","Being asked to memorise a script in one day when you have dyslexia is the same as having a broken foot and being asked to dance. You have to make exceptions for it.","At 21, you've come out of the craziness. Maybe you've been to university, but now it's time to get serious. It's the age where you make decisions about your life.","Do the little things that make you feel normal and happy, even if that's just getting in your pyjamas and watching 'X Factor' at the weekend.","When I'm at work, I do try and embody it as much as possible.","We're all lucky to be working, and I'm glad to be employed.","I don't stay in accent or anything, but internally, I get quite dark and destroy myself a little bit. But that's what I do, and I enjoy it. It's how I do my work.","I do have a lot of respect for the girls in 'Hollyoaks.' It takes a lot of effort to look like that constantly. I couldn't do it.","'Skins' has been such a great thing for our generation - I don't want it to become a parody of itself.","My friends still see me as the girl they went to school with. We're very much home bunnies.","It's important to enjoy the moment.","I didn't tell anyone in school that I was going to be in 'Skins.' I was terrified of them putting me down.","Kids will pick up on weakness, and I was very shy growing up. I was skinny and flat-chested; I didn't have the latest clothes. For me, it was about being left out and not having any friends and being laughed at. I was very lonely, but that happens to so many people.","I'm not good at dressing up. I always feel a bit out of place. It's just not me - high heels and designer dresses - and I can't seem to get used to it.","'Skins' meant so much to so many people. It was so much part of its time, and I was so young.","My mother is amazing. She moved from Surrey to London, taught herself English, and found a job.","I wasn't good at anything very much at school, but I did like drama.","I was incredibly shy and insecure as a child. I was bullied. I was dyslexic. I had an immigrant single parent. I was the opposite of that kind of ideal, cool girl thing.","I consider myself a Londoner first, and then I consider myself Brazilian before I consider myself English.","On 'Skins,' we only ever filmed for a couple of months in the summer. When I wasn't on set, I was doing my normal things.","A lot of my friends back home are boys, so I do well with boys I like.","I like to work. I feel blessed that I'm working.","I love my job every day. So whether it's for four years or for two weeks, it's still... And when you're working on a set, it feels like a family straight away.","I don't think there is enough youth employment or enough push for youths to kind of do want they want to do.","I'm not the best auditioner.","I'm a Londoner, so I'm a bit feisty.","I think if someone was really rude to me in an audition, even someone quite important, I think I'd be, 'What are you doing? Don't talk to me like that!'","The way I work, I didn't hold the accent all day.","It's very strange: I watch a lot of interviews with other actors that I know saying, 'Oh we had a great time; we're best buddies,' and I know for a fact that they didn't, and they actually hated each other.","'Skins' is actually a part of who I am as a person, so I was really focused on making sure the scripts and the story lines were right.","It was hard to go into the world and start auditioning as real actors. Having to pay bills was rather scary, too.","What attracted me to 'The Maze Runner' is its pure action.","It's nice to know that a studio is willing to put a female in a film without expecting the character to have a love interest.","Everyone asks, 'What's your goal? Do you want to win an Oscar? Do you want to work with Meryl Streep?' No! I want to buy my mum a house. I want to make her proud.","As a teenager, you're still discovering who you are, what your life is about, and who you want to be as a person. It's very intense.","I was very hesitant about doing a period film. It was very much out of my comfort zone; I'd never done anything like that before.","I would have loved the opportunity to have gone to drama school, but it just didn't work out for me; there are always several paths, and there's a reason why I've been down this path.","I am quite proud that I managed to prove that you don't have to be able to afford drama school or have the right connections to do well.","I believe there are some things meant only for you and the person you love.","We come from a very humble background. A lot of my paycheck from 'Skins' went to paying the bills and getting us a new sofa.","I wore an Urban Outfitters dress on my wedding day. It was one I had in the back of my wardrobe. It was white. We went to City Hall here in New York. I wore it with blue velvet boots my husband bought for me. I loved it. It was my favorite thing. It was chilled and spontaneous.","I think of women as an all-being creature.","We should just be good humans.","I've wanted to produce for a long time. I'd love to get a bunch of my girlfriends together - a female writer, a female director - and create something. Creatively, it's a different dimension. Why wouldn't people want that?","I had a really honest conversation with my husband about equal pay because we met on a movie where he was paid more than me just because of gender.","The fight for equal rights or pay has become this thing where people expect actresses to talk about it. Why they feel that a man is worth more is an important issue to discuss - we are moving in the right direction, but we need to continue to talk about it and continue to label it as an issue.","I think a lot of people, when they don't quite fit in in the world, use humor to combat that and to find their place in society.","'Skins' was the university for me. It was the best years of my life, really. We were all just a bunch of friends.","I played American when I was, like, fourteen, and I was awful. I cringed the whole way through.","The thing you think is going to be huge ends up not being huge at all, and the most minute thing you do is talked about for the rest of your life, so I try not to have any expectations at all. I think that helps, if you're just focusing on the project at hand.","'Southcliffe' is extremely dark. It's an extremely depressing, intense story, but the shoot was like being at Disneyland. It was unbelievably different from what we were filming.","Mum built a life for me in a difficult place at a difficult time.","She had to play the role of mother and father at the same time, and she did it to perfection. I managed to find a way through because of her. My mother is my biggest inspiration.","We lived in a council flat, and I spent most of my time on estates. My mum was very strict. I used to hate it.","Most people think of 'Wuthering Heights' as romantic; it's really not about that at all.","The moors have this weird energy. They trap you.","I've always had confidence issues; I just get scared of doing things wrong.","I was incredibly nervous about doing a period drama. I thought that to play period, you had to be English-looking and blonde and very well spoken, and have gone to drama school.","My mom raised me on her own, so I decided to take her name 'cause she was my mom and my dad.","My mother is Brazilian, and her grandfather was Italian.","I'm lucky to have fallen into this trade, and I'm still fighting to stay in it.","I'm lucky: I've got one of those fast metabolisms where I can eat whatever I want, and I don't put on weight. But I know that's only when you're young. It'll probably hit me when I'm 30.","I had to learn to jog because I run like a fish. All my friends found the thought of me running on screen hysterical because I do absolutely no exercise.","Every job I take, I really want to learn something.","I like movies because I've been getting leads, and TV is more about ensemble casts.","I really take a lot of influence from London style.","I love that kind of edgy, rock n' roll punk thing that we do so well in England. But my style adapts to where I am. When I'm in Los Angeles, suddenly I'm like, 'I need a sandal, and I need a beige dress, and I need some flowers in my hair.'","My hair was always frizzy. I always wanted to be blonde with lovely straight hair. I was very skinny. I was quite tomboyish, just very quiet. I always wanted to fit in; I just couldn't.","I had no confidence as a child; I still really don't. Acting is the only thing I've ever felt comfortable doing.","'Skins' was such a great platform for young actors. They had this whole thing about getting people who weren't trained, this new generation, this new culture.","'Skins' was never about sending a message. It was showing you everything there was and letting you make a decision.","My first secondary school was in East Finchley, and I was one of only five white people in the year. I was really skinny and flat-chested with frizzy hair. I don't consider myself posh, but my mum brought me up to speak properly, and they picked up on that, as all kids do.","I wanna make my mark, and I wanna be part of something!"],"Kayla Ewell":["My all-time favorite is Brad Pitt in 'Interview with the Vampire.' He's so sexy. I'm a fan of anything he does, but in that film he's a vampire who doesn't want to feed. There's something super sexy about someone who has to feed to survive but doesn't want to do it.","I'm a sucker for accents and any man who can actually sing and serenade you.","I used to date Kellan Lutz. We were together for two and a half years, but the distance and travel really kept us apart. In the end, we decided it wouldn't work, but we're still good friends.","I'm one of the only actresses in Los Angeles who has never waited tables - yet - and I'm so terrible at holding trays. When we shot the 'Vampire Diaries' pilot, I totally spilled water all down Nina Dobrev, and she had to get her hair and make-up redone.","Nowadays, everyone broadcasts everything about their life - I think vampires are really sexy because there's so much that you don't know about them. There's a lot of mystery.","I eat hamburgers all the time.","I'm sort of a gym buff. It's a stress relief for me. But I only go for 20 minutes at a time."],"Kayla Tausche":["Staffing branches with tellers can be considered a premium service in a world where fewer customers visit bank branches for transactions.","April Fool is widely considered one of the top yachts ever built by Feadship, the famed Dutch shipyard. Launched in 2006, April Fool has a huge master stateroom, a Jacuzzi on the fourth-level sun deck, a sauna, and sprawling outdoor dining lounge. The yacht first came onto the market in 2011 with a price of $69.5 million.","Peer-to-peer lenders originally sought to attract retail investors to its loan marketplace, but the lack of high-returning assets elsewhere in the market has made these platforms increasingly attractive to major asset managers and hedge funds.","Everything from Washington's handling of the N.S.A., as well as Apple launching a new iPhone. These events can move billions of dollars in the stock market, and it seems as if the East Coast and West Coast are merging in some respects, so we felt like we needed a little bit more from a content perspective to match what our audience was looking for.","The easier question might be, 'What isn't Alibaba?' The company is only 15 years old, but it has gotten so big over that timeframe that it basically touches every single part of the Chinese economy. I think the simplest comparison to draw is that it is like eBay and Amazon combined.","I think that, in addition of the intersection of media and technology, there has also been an intersection between technology and finance, which is something I find a little closer to home, seeing as I spend so much time covering Wall Street banks.","Certainly, some of the anti-bank rhetoric has shifted a little bit, but on either side of the aisle, there seems to be different tacts. On one side of the aisle, you see a proposed scaling back of Dodd-Frank. On the other, a proposed reinstatement of Glass-Steagall.","I always take a fiction break in between business books to keep the content from bleeding together.","Some of the closest friends you make in TV are the producers who travel on field assignments with you - you're together 24/7.","Live television invites a lot of comic relief, and I've definitely had my share. I got tongue-twisted on the word 'prevalent' once; had a homeless man accost me during a segment; and got my mic snagged off when a congressional staffer barged into my frame.","I'm trying to get on the yoga/pilates train, but I can't seem to sit still. I imagine a lot of reporters would say the same.","Banks now want you to pay for face time, as more institutions charge fees for what was once the ritual for withdrawing and depositing your money: interacting with a teller.","At Capital One 360, a customer forfeits the in-person experience to save money. If the app or website is down, a customer must send a deposit by mail.","At Bank of America, customers shunned a product that offered fee-free checking without access to branches.","When SoFi launched in 2011, it focused squarely on the burgeoning student loan market - a market that, unlike housing, had no viable option to refinance both federal and private student loans from higher interest-rate eras.","Dan Loeb has become a billionaire searching out value in financial markets.","An improving credit landscape means fewer loans are delinquent - and fewer people are needed to service these loans."],"Kayleen Schaefer":["A sure way to claim a bit of cool in Hollywood - if you're an actress, at least - is to announce you don't have a stylist. Some of the most consistently elegant, inimitable women on the red carpet, like Marion Cotillard, Blake Lively, and Diane Kruger, say they go at it alone.","There's nothing new about fashionable women borrowing from men's style; just think of Marlene Dietrich, Brigitte Bardot, or Diane Keaton.","In terms of its endorphin-boosting potential, a good hair day is on par with a good workout.","South Korea has very few natural resources. The country isn't stocked with oil, much natural gas, or even many minerals. What it does have is an enormous quantity of sheet masks, BB creams, essences, and face masks packaged to look like tomatoes.","The thing with the mustache is, it's a classic. A guy can always wear a mustache. But it's still tricky and potentially fraught with peril.","A guy in a mustache looks best dressed up in a suit. A track suit and mustache won't help your look. You need to look groomed and polished.","Galentine's Day is the day before Valentine's Day. People sometimes think, 'Oh, it's a replacement for Valentine's Day.' But it's not. You can celebrate Galentine's and Valentine's. And it comes from the sitcom 'Parks And Recreation'... Amy Poehler's character created this holiday because she wanted a day to celebrate her girlfriends.","There just isn't only one love story in our lives.","Holiday shopping can be tough: sometimes you don't know what to get a person; sometimes you really do just want to help those in need."],"Kaytranada":["Deep down, you know what you want, and you should go for it.","I don't think about doing new. I just do it.","The way I picked the tracks for '99.9%' was based on the feeling of, 'Is this going to be a hit?' I wanted songs that people would immediately hear and remember.","You gotta be versatile, man.","It's pretty much about doing what you love and following your dreams. It sounds really corny, but it's so real.","I know a lot of people who jumped into a record label right away, dropped an album, and then nothing happened for them. Build your fan base first, and follow your gut.","I'm looking for all types of sounds. Anything that has soul and funk in it, no matter the genre.","Neo-soul caught my attention more than any other sub-genre. I was really attracted by that sound. It made me do what I do musically: trying to find the same type of vibes, those nostalgic vibes.","I used to listen to my music on the bus. It was one of my favourite things, to look out the window and over at the Jacques Cartier Bridge and Parc Jean-Drapeau.","I come from hip hop for sure, and there are basic elements of that, but then I'll take from somewhere else, like samba, and do it with trap drums. I like going places other people haven't gone before.","I like that people are still trying to guess what kind of music I'm making.","I felt like there were two people inside me. I was trying to be somebody I was not, and I was frustrated that people didn't know who I was.","Really, what I'm trying to do is make soul music, but I don't even think of it as a genre. It's more of a feeling.","When I'm playing, I play what I want, but I make sure that the crowd is going to love it at the same time. It's like a balancing act, a mix of two, a perfect circle... if you do it right.","I don't have much of a wish list, but I'm dying to work with Erykah Badu. That's pretty much my dream collaboration.","I don't feel like a live set even seems super real for an electronic act like me. It's not really that entertaining. I've seen a lot of my favourite acts take it to a new level with a live band and stuff, which is amazing, but for me, a live set would be boring to watch.","'99.9%' is the end product of years and years of me going through multiple styles and interests.","I'm from the suburbs, really, so I actually didn't go to Montreal until I was, like, 19. I wasn't allowed to go to the city at night or really be in the scene with other producers. It was hard for my parents to understand what I was trying to do as an artist, but it didn't stop me. They eventually saw that it wasn't a joke.","Some people say I make hip-hop. Others see me as doing EDM. Some people might look at me as a trap artist, but I'm not really stuck to any of those.","I'm always home, doing nothing, making beats, and watching movies.","I'm my own stylist. Always! I don't wanna hire someone to chose what I should wear. At the same time, I do always wanna wear some crazy clothes.","The producing side is always a hard thing for me. I look at Flying Lotus and see producers dropping instrumentals, and I think I should do it myself. I just try to be an artist for myself. That way, it's a lot easier.","I can't judge Justin Bieber, because I don't know him.","When I make a good beat, I'm possessed. I'm not on earth!","It's easier to collaborate with instrumentalists than singers; they know exactly the sound that I need.","I love the London vibe. I get so much love from London that I never had from other places. It's crazy. The people there understand music so much more.","Nando's - boom! That's what I'm thinking of whenever I'm in London. I go there every time.","I don't want awkward shows with people looking at their phones or tweeting. That's something you should do at home.","People should be going to shows to have fun and express themselves - just enjoy it!","The DJ thing is just a way for me to perform my songs in public. It put me on the map, and a lot of people discovered me because of my DJing and later found out that I made beats.","I've always wanted to push someone who's not really known but has mad talent. I don't know if I'm going to do a publishing company or a record label, but I'm interested in pushing artists in any sense.","I've always wanted to produce a whole album for an artist.","Especially for Haitian immigrant parents, being a musician is not a job.","I always say I want creative control. A lot of people don't think about that. And that's what every artist should think of - being creative and not just a puppet.","I suck at video games.","I was really not into school. Everything was distracting to me. I would have a beat in my head or a song. I was always not paying attention, just daydreaming.","I'm not just a remix guy.","I didn't finish high school. I tried to as an adult, but with all this touring, I had to quit."],"Kazimir Malevich":["Painters were also attorneys, happy storytellers of anecdote, psychologists, botanists, zoologists, archaeologists, engineers, but there were no creative painters.","Painting is the aesthetic side of the object but it has never been original, has never been its own goal."],"Kazuo Ishiguro":["I'm interested in memory because it's a filter through which we see our lives, and because it's foggy and obscure, the opportunities for self-deception are there. In the end, as a writer, I'm more interested in what people tell themselves happened rather than what actually happened.","I want my words to survive translation.","There's something peculiar about writing fiction. It requires an interesting balance between seeing the world as a child and having the wisdom of a middle-aged person. The further you get from childhood and the experience of the teenage years, the greater the danger of losing that wellspring.","Many of our deepest motives come, not from an adult logic of how things work in the world, but out of something that is frozen from childhood.","I like the fact that by mimicking the way memory works, a writer can actually write in a fluid way - one solid scene doesn't have to fall on another solid scene, you can just have a fragment that then dovetails into another one that took place 30 years apart from it.","There was another life that I might have had, but I am having this one.","There are things I am more interested in than the clone thing. How are they trying to find their place in the world and make sense of their lives? To what extent can they transcend their fate? As time starts to run out, what are the things that really matter?","When you become a parent, or a teacher, you turn into a manager of this whole system. You become the person controlling the bubble of innocence around a child, regulating it.","As a writer, I'm more interested in what people tell themselves happened rather than what actually happened.","We all live inside bodies that will deteriorate. But when you look at human beings, they're capable of very decent things: love, loyalty. When time is running out, they don't care about possessions or status. They want to put things right if they've done wrong.","I wouldn't want to try to adapt something of my own. It would be like going back to school and doing all my exams again.","This is the big question that we all have about our children: How much, how soon, do we tell our children the less comfortable facts about the world they're going to inherit?","I had been plunged into a different world. I found myself spending half my time answering weird questions on book tours in the Midwest. People would stand up and explain to me the situation in their office and ask me whether they should resign or not.","I discovered that my imagination came alive when I moved away from the immediate world around me.","I had the sense when I looked back over my life I would actually see a mess of decisions, a few of which I had thought about, some of which I had sort of stumbled on and many that I had no control over whatsoever.","I'm always trying to make something that is impossible to film. Why would somebody just read a novel when they can see it on TV or in the cinema? I really have to think of the things fiction can do that film can't and play to the strengths of the novel. With a novel, you can get right inside somebody's head.","I started as a songwriter and wanted to be like Leonard Cohen. I've always seen my stories as enlarged songs.","I try to always go for something... very interior, following thoughts and memories, something that I think is difficult to do on the screen, which is essentially a third-person medium.","My wife is the most savage critic. She doesn't feel intimidated by my reputation. As far as she's concerned, she's just criticising a boyfriend who'd recently had a go at fiction. She can tell me to abandon whole novels.","What is difficult is the promotion, balancing the public side of a writer's life with the writing. I think that's something a lot of writers are having to face. Writers have become much more public now.","Memory is quite central for me. Part of it is that I like the actual texture of writing through memory. I like the atmospheres that result if episodes are narrated through the haze of memory.","To some extent, at least, you have to shield children from what you know and drip-feed information to them. Sometimes that is kindly meant, and sometimes not.","All children have to be deceived if they are to grow up without trauma.","I don't hang out with the glitteringly successful people; I hang out with people who've been friends for many years, and to some extent I feel my worldly success is a bit uncomfortable for them.","The book was at a reasonably high position on the New York Times... before I was in the country. I thought it would be an interesting experiment to see if my presence here would push it up or down.","People aren't quite sure what it means when a book is a Booker Prize winner. They're not quite sure what is being recommended, what literary values it stands for, because every year it stands for something different.","There's a practical problem about time and energy, and a more subtle problem of what it does to a writer's head, to continually analyze why they write, where it all comes from, where it's going to.","Now when I look back to the Guildford of that time, it seems far more exotic to me than Nagasaki.","When I got to 40 or so... I had the sense when I looked back over my life I would actually see a mess of decisions, a few of which I had thought about, some of which I had sort of stumbled on, and many that I had no control over whatsoever.","Screenplays I didn't really care about, journalism, travel books, getting my writer friends to write about their dreams or something. I just determined to write the books I had to write.","I think I had actually served my apprenticeship as a writer of fiction by writing all those songs. I had already been through phases of autobiographical or experimental stuff.","I couldn't speak Japanese very well, passport regulations were changing, I felt British, and my future was in Britain. And it would also make me eligible for literary awards. But I still think I'm regarded as one of their own in Japan.","I like novelists who can create other interesting worlds.","There comes a point when you can more or less count the number of books you're going to write before you die.","There's something very misleading about the literary culture that looks at writers in their 30s and calls them 'budding' or 'promising', when in fact they're peaking.","I was a little concerned that a lot of people thought I wrote Merchant Ivory movies. I also thought if I was ever going to write something strange and difficult, that was the time.","I spent ages figuring out things like viewpoint, how you tell the story, and so on.","Memory is quite central for me. Part of it is that I like the actual texture of writing through memory.","I'm very fortunate in that I don't have money problems. I have lunch with my wife at home. I don't have to commute, so I have much more time with my family.","The world is crawling with authors touring now. They're like performance artists.","Our family arrived in England in 1960. At that time I thought the war was ancient history. But if I think of 15 years ago from now, that's 1990, and that seems like yesterday to me.","People were incredibly kind to our family and went out of their way to help.","My friends and I took songwriting very, very seriously. My hero was and still is Bob Dylan, but also people like Leonard Cohen and Joni Mitchell and that whole generation.","I felt slightly superior to student politics, for instance. I had no reason to think this, but I thought of myself as slightly more seasoned. I became quite cynical talking to my student friends.","I do feel part of that generation of people who were rather idealistic in the '70s and became disillusioned in the '80s. Not just about social services issues, but the world.","If you look at my last songs and first short stories, there is a real connection between them.","I want my words to survive translation. I know when I write a book now I will have to go and spend three days being intensely interrogated by journalists in Denmark or wherever. That fact, I believe, informs the way I write - with those Danish journalists leaning over my shoulder.","I work very regular hours, roughly 9 to 5:30. I think I have it much easier than a lot of parents. I just sit at home, I have a very flexible timetable, and I'm very fortunate in that I don't have money problems. I have lunch with my wife at home. I don't have to commute, so I have much more time with my family.","I'm not at all interested in the brave who fight against the odds and win. I am interested in those who accept their lot, as that is what many people in the world are doing. They do their best in ghastly conditions.","When I was younger, I didn't read that much. I was more interested in film and music. Now I'm curious. I want to know what it's all about.","When I write a novel, I want it to be completely different from a screenplay. I'm very conscious of the difference, and I want novels to work purely as novels. Otherwise I don't see how they'll survive - why don't we just all go to the movies or watch television.","When I see films made from books, I make a huge effort not to remember the book. It's important to see the film as a film.","I've always had a great fondness for English detective fiction such as Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers.","I don't have a deep link with England like, say, Jonathan Coe or Hanif Kureishi might demonstrate. For me, it is like a mythical place.","When you're lucky enough to have a good film made of your novel - and 'Never Let Me Go' is, believe me, a heartbreakingly good film indeed - you get wonderfully talented individuals each focusing on their special area.","I loved cowboy films and TV series, and I learned bits of English from them. My favorite was 'Laramie', with Robert Fuller and John Smith. I used to watch 'The Lone Ranger', which had been famous in Japan as well. I idolized these cowboys.","Why would somebody just read a novel when they can see it on TV or in the cinema? I really have to think of the things fiction can do that film can't and play to the strengths of the novel. With a novel, you can get right inside somebody's head.","Even though I spent the first five years of my life in Nagasaki, going to Japan can be really difficult. Even if they know I've been brought up in the West, they still expect me to understand all the subtleties of their culture, and if I get it wrong, it matters much more than if a British person gets it wrong. I find it intimidating.","I think jogging is bad for your health. All that pressure on the knees and back cannot be good for you.","What interests me is the surprising enormous extent to which most people accept the fate that's been given to them, and find some dignity.","We always like to keep our children in a kind of bubble and censor the bad news about the world. We like to tell them the world is full of benevolent, nice people."],"Keahu Kahuanui":["I started taking pictures when I was around 10, so I have been inadvertently been training my eye for it for years. Traveling gave me a ton of practice as well, and the ability, once you learn to properly manipulate and capture light and freeze any moment in time for safe keeping, has always fascinated me.","I do what I'm allowed, but I gladly let the professional - and often incredibly talented - stunt team to do their jobs. Even with all their training, they still get hurt.","Because some of my at-home life was rough and lonely, I often looked to escape into my imagination. Science fiction provided a deep well to pull from and was something easily accessible to me.","A departure from the movie with Michael J. Fox, 'Teen Wolf' tells the story of how a group of angsty teens deal with werewolves, their supernatural kin and the world of trouble that comes with it, all while trying to still live their lives.","I was a bit of an introvert growing up, and I tended to do better in math and science at school, so I went with it."],"Keala Settle":["I used to want to look like every European person that was being held up as a standard of beauty, whether in the industry or in life. Then I just realized that it's not in my genetic make-up. I decided instead to go for the gold in whatever I'm doing and just be as healthy as I can be.","The parts that I get to play are not based around the European beauty standards: They're more about character, and I love that.","I was never one of those actors who believed, 'I'm so gonna be an ingenue.' I already knew that wasn't gonna happen, and I decided not to torture myself with it.","Women put ourselves through so much. Really, everybody does; it's not a gendered thing. I think all of us are always gonna be tortured by some sense of inadequacy, no matter what. I don't know if there's a way to tell people not do this to themselves.","I have a lot of cultures within me - I'm basically chop suey.","There is a struggle when you do represent so many countries within you, but that makes you who you are.","I'm an actress who likes to work as much as possible, so I'm very grateful for all these opportunities.","We weren't wearing shoes on a full-time basis until prom.","Music was always a part of my life.","It takes a damn village to get a show on Broadway!","Stevie Wonder was a big influence in my life.","To be honest, being a fat girl, when people are telling you you need to eat, it's the biggest thrill of your life.","I was causing trouble in high school, and in order to get me to stop and to pass, they put me into theater, and I ended up winning a Shakespeare competition. All I had to do was imitate people properly, and I ended up going to the finals when I was about 16.","We all have fears! Don't lie! We all have fears.","If anybody says they're not afraid of themselves, they're lying!","There's always doubt and fear. If you're a human being, everybody's got it.","I've always been afraid of who I am and not knowing what I can do.","I've always been the biggest bully to myself.","No one can bully me better than me. I'm the first person to the party going, 'Don't worry - you don't have to cut me down, 'cause I'm already there.' I struggled with all those voices and gave them so much power, to the point where they took over my life.","What is so beautiful about a composer and a lyricist is that their job is to push a story along and not halt it.","I used to not walk out the door; I was so afraid. Everything from, 'You shouldn't be here,' down to, 'Girl, don't wear those pants.' I was so sad. I tried my best to not even look in a mirror!","There were pockets of this career - whatever you want to call it - where I said, 'I've tapped out. I don't want to do this. I'm gonna go be a stage hand. I don't want to do this. I don't want to talk to people. I'm afraid of people. I'm going to walk away from everything that this was and is.'","As a human being, you find a way to survive, moment by moment, every single day of your life.","I used to be a pop singer; well, not used to be. I am an R&B singer. My emphasis was on Stevie Wonder and Chaka Khan and Aretha Franklin.","Musically, I'm a huge fan of Stephen Sondheim, and I love, love 'Sweeney Todd.'","I love people that go the distance. I hate things that are lukewarm. They've got to be one way or the other and go all the way.","Sometimes I get frustrated with my own self because I'm such a perfectionist.","I would have loved to play Atticus in 'To Kill a Mockingbird.' There's no music in it, but it doesn't mean I wouldn't want to do it!","'Miscast' is a family affair. It highlights so many different aspects of the industry in that one night, and it's a great evening.","I was born and raised in Hawaii.","If someone puts a character in front of me - no matter what it is, whether there has been a film or not - I want to be that character, not imitate it. There's a difference - a big difference.","For me, I want to say whether or not you believe in God - or a universe of any kind that's watching over any of us - you can have faith that things will go your way as much as you want to, and they won't.","No one was created to be alone.","I was successfully hiding from the world on Broadway for about 25 years.","I loved dancing.","I wake up in the morning, and I look in a mirror, and I go, 'Is this really all I got? Is this all the universe has given me?'","It doesn't matter if you're a Victoria's Secret model or you're someone's 90-year-old grandma or you're a little kid who's getting bullied or you're that kid's bully - everybody feels like there's something going on that's more correct than what is. We all have to reach out to one another in that fear, and we'd be surprised to hear, 'Me, too.'","When I was younger, my mother wanted me to look like Claudia Schiffer. I was like, 'We're not even German, but all right.'","As you get older, whatever your struggles may be - how you sound, how you look, how you dress - you grow into yourself a little bit more. You end up realizing the world wants you and not a carbon copy of six other people.","I woke up one day and thought, 'Enough is enough with bullying myself.' The war is within you, and that's also where it's won. You just have to tackle your insecurities and then let them go.","On days I'm not working, I don't wear a ton of other makeup, but if I have to look like I care, I'll use this By Terry Ombre Blackstar eye shadow stick in Frozen Quartz and Eyeko mascara.","My mother played guitar by ear, and all of us sang except my father, bless his heart.","My mother taught us all to bake. It literally calmed us down, and she was able to get rid of all her frustrations.","My goal is to stay in good health, and every day, I wake up and pray that I do.","Broadway is really, really hard.","Everyone makes mistakes, and we need to learn to forgive ourselves.","I never got to see the circus... I was always in love with being a trapeze artist, though."],"Keanu Reeves":["Falling in love and having a relationship are two different things.","Money doesn't mean anything to me. I've made a lot of money, but I want to enjoy life and not stress myself building my bank account. I give lots away and live simply, mostly out of a suitcase in hotels. We all know that good health is much more important.","Grief changes shape, but it never ends.","On a good night, I get underwear, bras, and hotel-room keys thrown onstage... You start to think that you're Tom Jones.","It's always wonderful to get to know women, with the mystery and the joy and the depth. If you can make a woman laugh, you're seeing the most beautiful thing on God's Earth.","The simple act of paying attention can take you a long way.","I am not handsome or sexy. Of course, it's not like I am hopeless.","I'm Mickey Mouse. They don't know who's inside the suit.","How do people relate to movies now, when they're on portable devices or streaming them? It's not as much about going to the movies. That experience has changed.","I'm sorry my existence is not very noble or sublime.","I'm not a photographer, so I didn't get into F-stops or ND filters or background, foreground, cross-light, all that stuff. But I was interested in the camera and the lenses. That's the world that I'm moving in, in terms of acting and giving a performance.","I believe in love at first sight. You want that connection, and then you want some problems.","But I think we're also just talking about the literacy of the audience. The visual literacy of the audience. They've seen so many images now, especially here in the States. There's so much to look at, to watch. So the visual storytelling literacy is harder to impress.","Sometimes when you make a film you can go away for three months and then come back and live your life. But this struck a much deeper chord. I don't have the ability yet to speak about it in an objective.","I had the classic 40 meltdown. I did. It's embarrassing. It was pretty funny. But then I recovered. To me, it was like a second adolescence. Hormonally, my body was changing, my mind was changing, and so my relationship to myself and the world around me came to this assault of finiteness.","But, you know, it's still a drag to get your picture taken when you're eating a sandwich. It's a downer.","Basically it starts with four months of training, just basic stretching, kicking and punching. Then you come to the choreography and getting ready to put the dance together.","Because we're actors we can pretend and fake it, but I'd rather the intimate investment was authentic.","And of course to work with Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton, and work with a wonderful, beautiful script directed by Nancy Meyers, it was really for me a dream come true.","I am waiting for the right story to tell. Just like 'Man of Tai Chi' just seemed to be the right story to tell. So I'm looking for that. Because I really love directing. I love developing the story. I love actors. I love the cinema of it, the way that you tell a story visually.","I was always interested - I mean, it's kind of part of your job - I was always interested in the camera.","'Speed' and 'Point Break' were a lot of running and jumping, and then 'The Matrix Trilogy' had a lot of fights and wire work and green screen elements.","Energy can't be created or destroyed, and energy flows. It must be in a direction, with some kind of internal, emotive, spiritual direction. It must have some effect somewhere.","Sure I believe in God and the Devil, but they don't have to have pitchforks and a long white beard.","Kissing someone is pretty intimate, actually very intimate, and your heart always kind of skips a beat before you do that.","The truth is often terrifying, which I think is one of the motifs of Larry and Andrew's cinema. The cost of knowledge is an important theme. In the second and third films, they explore the consequences of Neo's choice to know the truth. It's a beautiful, beautiful story.","I'm a meathead, man. You've got smart people, and you've got dumb people. I just happen to be dumb.","It's the journey of self, I guess. You start with this kind of loner, outside guy, which a lot of people can relate to, and he goes out into the world.","Letters are something from you. It's a different kind of intention than writing an e-mail.","I don't know the law, the kind of law of quantity and quality, but I think the opportunity of people being able to express themselves and to have the means of production is a great thing. It's also changing how we're telling stories.","Oftentimes, when we think of 3D, we think of things coming out of the screen, but actually, you've got this zero, this negative space, what they call the negative space, which is the scene, what's being filmed in the positive space of the audience. As you can have things come out, you can have all of this depth.","I'm a meathead. I can't help it, man. You've got smart people and you've got dumb people.","I try not to think about my life. I have no life. I need therapy.","It's fun to be hopelessly in love. It's dangerous, but it's fun.","How do I confront aging? With a wonder and a terror. Yeah, I'll say that. Wonder and terror.","I think the form, the Hollywood movie, I think the quality is obviously always going to be there and I think that the question of taste, there's always a question of taste.","Eventually, it came to this place like, 'I'd like to direct, but I need to find the story to tell.' 'Man of Tai Chi' became the story to tell.","I loved the material when I first read it, and the experience of making the film was a great one. So when we came around to complete the trilogy, I just signed on board without even reading the scripts because the experience of the first film was so good.","Mortality is very different when you're 20 to when you're 50.","My name can't be that tough to pronounce!","I used to have nightmares that they would put 'He played Ted' on my tombstone.","When I don't feel free and can't do what I want I just react. I go against it.","You want to play another kind of character in another genre, and it's been something I've been trying to do if I can in the career so far, and it's something I hope to continue because it's interesting to me and you get to do different things as an actor.","But I did 'Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure.' They made a cereal out of it, so once you've had a cereal, it doesn't get much more surreal than that. Surreal cereal.","You know what, I'd done an interview show when I was like 16 or 17. One of my first jobs. I did interviews for this television show in Toronto.","When we talk about how movies used to be made, it was over 100 years of film, literal, physical film, with emulsion, that we would expose to light and we would get pictures.","It's easy to become very self-critical when you're an actor. Then you get critiqued by the critics. Whether you agree with them or not, people are passing judgment on you.","I have definitely been curious and involved in the process; even as a young actor. I was always looking at where the camera was, what story it was telling. And as my experience grew, I wanted to know even more.","I've had the opportunity to work with so many great directors. Different styles, as well, like Gus Van Sant. He just does the casting and the milieu and let's you do your thing, quietly. Bertolucci, who can talk to you about your internal world in quite a creative way or just say, 'Well, put your hand over here.'","I mean, I went to a Catholic boys' school for a year, but that was to play hockey. Religion class was quite contentious for me.","I just felt that if I went into Speed 2, I just... wouldn't have come up out of the water.","I want to make a good, solid kung fu movie.","Here comes 40. I'm feeling my age and I've ordered the Ferrari. I'm going to get the whole mid-life crisis package.","People were saying that David Geffen and I had gotten married and it just blew me away. Not that they thought I was gay, but that they thought I could land a guy that hot.","When the people you love are gone, you're alone.","I've been really fortunate to be able to do different kinds of films in different scales, different genres, different kinds of roles, and that is important to me.","The whole aspect of cinema and film festivals should be a moment to come together and celebrate art and humanity. It would be a shame if there was such a divide.","I've been pleased to work with so many wonderful stars through the years. This has been an amazing journey. I hope it continues.","I mean, if you didn't get it or if you didn't feel like you enjoyed it, sometimes that experience can change.","I have a producing partner named Stephen Hamel, and we've been trying to generate material.","I do think there must be some kind of interaction between your living life and the life that goes on from here.","Artists are losing the choice to use film. People have a love for it - the grain, how it feels, the texture.","I think - I don't know, maybe it's nostalgia. But the choice, losing the choice to be able to use film is going to be - it's gone. It's going to be gone."],"Keegan Allen":["Sorry, I don't eat any fast food. I believe in eating healthy organic foods for a better lifestyle.","When I was in high school, my friends and I would drive out into the country to abandoned houses and structures... haha... to ghost hunt. We would scare each other so bad! We would sometimes camp out by the abandoned buildings just to scare ourselves! Such good times. The adrenaline of real fear is so cool!","As an actor, to go and see those shows - great plays like 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' and Clifford Odets's 'Golden Boy' - it's so exhilarating. I'd personally love to perform the role of Jerry in Edward Albee's 'The Zoo Story.' He's a transient, lost soul, and an example of humanity at its rawest.","I really like playing the bad guy. There are so many more objectives to play when you're mad or villainesque, or when there's some agenda that you have. That's drama, that's where the heart lives. I love playing the bad guy, but especially the bad guy who's still with the girl.","The stage calls my name.","But I love to write music. What I would love to do is give some of the songs I write to someone like Taylor Swift because I feel like she could sing them.","I personally call one of my fans every month. I answer all of my own fan mail.","I have my dream job! As a young person training as an actor, walking on the WB studio lot is a dream in itself.","Once I start reading something, I can't stop. I obsessively read, which is a problem with long books!","When I was 17, I was hyperactive and annoyed my teachers.","The scariest movie I have ever seen, and my favorite horror film is, 'The Exorcist.' It is a must-see horror/thriller classic. I watch it every couple of years."],"Keegan Bradley":["When it's deep into the season and you're not playing well, it's frustrating. This is when it's time to revisit some basics.","You can't swing with hesitation; you can't try to steer the ball to the flag; you can't worry about that water hazard as you take the club back. You have to pick the right club, visualize the shot you want to hit, and then focus on that shot until the ball is gone.","It's very difficult to consistently hit good iron shots if you get off to a bad start. That's why I'm always paying attention to my setup and takeaway.","Growing up in Vermont, no matter what I did, I didn't get much recognition.","I realize Tiger Woods is Tiger Woods; he's intimidating.","I love team environments, like the Celtics, the Bruins. I love going into the locker room and meeting these guys.","People look at me weird because I'm a Howard Stern fan, but he's very misunderstood. It's the first thing I do when I get in my car at a tournament - just pray that I get Howard 100 on Sirius or XM.","I've always played my best golf in the summer.","The beauty is, while you're working on chipping, you're also working on driving. This is because the bottoms of both swings - the area around impact - are identical.","When I throw a softball, there's no time to think about the motion of my arm. I just look at the first baseman's glove and react.","It's such an advantage to be able to hit short irons low on command. When it's windy, you'll hit more greens. But low shots are a great strategy in calm conditions, too: The less time the ball hangs in the air, the less time it has to stray off line from the flagstick.","To flight approach shots lower with the scoring clubs - what I consider my 7-iron through wedges - I stand two or three inches closer to the ball than normal.","Especially in wind, each shot and stance can feel different, so it's important to first get comfortable.","The best part about winning the PGA is getting great pairings at tour events. It's fun to play with Phil Mickelson and other past major champions.","I like using a 75-percent swing for wedge shots instead of full force.","I was the first to win a major with a belly putter, and I've spent hours practicing that way, so I hope they don't ban anchoring.","Seems like my iron play gets a little better every year. Which makes sense - I've been working hard on things with my teacher, Jim McLean.","Most amateurs are so worried about mis-hitting the shot or hitting it off line, they don't make an aggressive move. You'd be surprised how much better your swing will get if you let your natural athletic ability shine. So go after it."],"Keegan Connor Tracy":["I'm always playing extremes, either the vulnerable girl or the vixen.","I like to make definite choices and give my characters as many unique edges as possible.","I would get parts and not be able to take them because my mother didn't have a car."],"Keegan-Michael Key":["You can not have comedy unless people are behaving badly. You can't have it.","I get overwhelmed when I approach things intellectually.","If you look at any successful skit comedy show, ever, there is that format of introducing you to the player in the beginning, and then going on to see those sketches.","To make an absolutely gross generalization, I think a lot of people feel like if you're mixed, more often than not you're quote unquote white. So if you're mixed, you embrace the mainstream culture more than the African-American culture.","I'm adopted, so I didn't know my father, but apparently he was pretty tall.","A poet can feel free, in my estimation, to write a poem for himself. Or a painter can paint a painting for himself. You can write a short story for yourself. But for me, comedy by its nature is communal. If other people don't get it, I'm not sure why you are doing it.","I'm tall and thin but not strong, so you're either an athlete or you're funny.","When you're a child, the most important thing is to be able to live a life of comfort. You want to be sure that the moon goes up at night and the sun comes up in the morning and dad comes home from work.","I'm very concerned with what's going on the news, but I would not call myself a political animal, per se. I pay more attention during election years, or if I see some topic or issue that I care about. But I would never call myself a political animal or political junkie.","There's a thing called the 'One Drop' theory in African-American culture, which is if you have one drop of black blood in you, you're black.","It was very important thousands of years ago to categorize things. I can eat that plant, I can't eat that plant. Or this tribe, not that tribe. We don't have to do that anymore - we have processed food now!","Everybody puts on airs, regardless of race.","For me, as a child, I certainly thought that there were more black people in the world than white people.","I have always, or for the most part, identified myself as a biracial person.","Surprise is not humor. I think that there can be a fine line there.","My parents were not big sports fans, but my mother loved Barry Sanders, but she wasn't a huge fan. Now she likes Calvin Johnson. He's such an amazing athlete and such a wonderful, humble guy.","Being a Lions fan is like being a Cubs fan: you just have to keep going. You don't have a choice. You can't give up, because one day, when it happens - and I believe it'll happen - then you can really savor it because you were there in the doldrums, and you get to be there in the victory.","I was raised Catholic, so guilt shackles you from acting like a complete fool all the time.","I'm a great consumer of kung-fu movies - mid-'70s to late-'80s.","I'm trying every day, when I meet a new human being, to not have the first thought that comes into my mind be, 'Are they going to like me?' I'm allowed to say, 'I like this, and I don't like that.'","At times, I can be vocal about what I think people want to hear as opposed to being vocal about what I really feel.","I'm looking for human stories to do.","I'm a firm believer in the idea that there are a limited amount of human stories that we tell - there's about seven of them - and of course, there's variations on those stories, and they can take place in infinite places.","I love dialects and accents; they're something that really resonate with me and that I find fascinating.","Some of the friendliest, friendliest people you're going to meet are going to be in Detroit.","I would like to invest more of my brain space in understanding the history of my city, because whenever I learn about the history of Detroit, it's always so fascinating, from a little kind of beaver-trading post to the place where automobiles were manufactured.","Bill Murray is such a tremendous talent, but the world wasn't ready for 'Razor's Edge,' for something that thoughtful and with that much depth at that time in his career.","It's when you're true to yourself that resonates with other people.","With a lot of my comedic heroes, I'm trying to make sure that, wherever they might have gotten off-track a bit, I've learned that lesson.","The immediacy of improvisation is intoxicating, but there's an intimacy that you get that's very different when you're doing drama.","Success isn't measured by the amount of people that watch you unless you allow it to be.","I would play just about any role, male or female, in the Anton Chekov play 'The Cherry Orchard,' which I love.","I would love to play a fun character. Like, I would love to be in 'A Long Day's Journey Into Night.' I love that play. I'd play Edmond or Jamie. I don't care which.","There's a very famous South African playwright named Athol Fugard, and I'd be in any play he's ever did.","There's something very simple and contemplative about 'John Wick' - what is interesting is that it looks like it was based on an Akira Kurosawa movie.","I don't know if people would be surprised by this or not, but I'm kind of into nutrition and weight lifting. I know I'm kind of a slender man, but the human physique fascinates me, and learning about metabolism.","I'm very, very, very interested in martial arts.","I'm from the Midwest, so I always assumed, 'Well, I have to think badly of myself, because that's being humble.'","I want to make movies and pieces of television and pieces of art that crack everyone's assumptions.","We live in a gray world, and I want to tell gray stories."],"Keeley Hawes":["I don't like dirt. Cleanliness is high on my agenda, but I don't have a phobia of dirt. I'm just not keen on it. I don't really like dirty people or houses or smelly things.","There's nowhere to hide in the theatre. You can't be the one in rehearsal who doesn't know their lines.","My beauty regime is very simple. I just take my make-up off before bed. And oh, I always put moisturiser on. But that's about it, apart from a bit of soap maybe.","Botox and other fillers make everybody look the same, with the big cheekbones where they fill you up. It's much cheaper to have a fringe - it takes years off everybody.","Marriage and being a mother are absolutely crucial to my happiness and my life.","My husband is the chef of the family; he's a brilliant cook. Actually, it makes you quite lazy when you have somebody that's so good at cooking under the same roof. It's all beans or spaghetti when I'm left to run it.","I hope to be still acting when I'm 70 on TV, film and theatre.","When you think about such fine actors as Maggie Smith or Michael Gambon, they do all mediums. I think it would be quite sad and a bit dull just to have to stick to one. I like all of them.","There's always a sense of tragedy with icons. It happened to both the Princess of Wales and Diana Dors. A lot of people had grown up with them, and everybody loved them. Then, when they had at last found happiness, they were taken in the most dreadful way.","When I grew up in central London, we had six pavement slabs for a garden.","The funny thing about children is that, whichever room we're in, that's where they'll be. If I'm in the bath, they'll want to be in there too, playing with the toothbrush pot or brushing my hair.","If there's room for 30 reality shows, surely there's room for two amazing costume dramas.","I do love playing aristocrats, probably because it's so against type. So much more interesting than playing a version of yourself.","I happen to know there is nothing sexy or romantic about love scenes. They are just awful to do.","I'm not saying that every night of the week, my husband, ex-husband, our children and I all sit around together like one big happy family. But we do see each other frequently, and everyone loves each other, and we are all friends.","When you get into your 40s, the roles do tend to drop off, and I've seen it happening to friends of mine. Hopefully it is improving, and there are female TV executives now who are championing women of all ages in leading roles. But I'm not counting on it.","There are lots of actors who are posh and stick with that, and there are lots of actors who are cockney, and that's what they do. That's fine, but I don't think that could be said about me.","I've stopped worrying about whether people think what I do is any good. I've taken stick in the past, and I've genuinely worried and got incredibly upset.","Things can change on a daily basis in television. You can be introduced to aspects of your character that you had no idea existed because they didn't exist a week before. The next week it might be taken away from you in some way that you can't control.","It's very easy to keep putting off having a family if you enjoy your job, but you just have to get on with life.","I'm a size 12 and I'm very happy with it.","Life is simply too short to think about everything you put in your mouth, and it's not good for children to see you picking over bits of salad.","Coming from a family where the parents had been together for 40 years, you never imagine that divorce is going to happen to you.","I think if you do a lot of interviews, you're laying yourself open. If you put yourself out, accept every invitation to every premiere, then you can't really complain when people knock on your front door and photograph you in the street.","I've nothing against stay-at-home mums, but I love going to work, I love what I do and I wouldn't want to start resenting my home life if I was staying home 365 days a year.","We're not an acting family, but my parents have always encouraged me.","I've never seen an episode of 'Downton Abbey.'","I love fashion; I adore it. I love the madness of it.","I prefer watching movies on the sofa rather than sitting next to Bob Geldof at a premiere and wanting to kill yourself.","Yes, I'm anal. I am just really organised.","'Ashes To Ashes' is a victim of its own success. We started lots of trends. I like to think we had something to do with bringing back the high waist. It's so much more flattering.","Something like a divorce does change you, but children change you more, and now I've had three.","There are all sorts of ways you can take somebody's identity or change your own, and a million things you can do with it once you have. It's quite incredible.","In the adverts, I look like I do because 150 people have spent seven hours making me look dazzling. That's not me at all.","It's a healthy thing to get some bad criticism. I'm still here and I'm fine, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't get to you reading the negative stuff.","If I was ambitious in my career, then I would have moved to the United States and given it a good go at films.","I love washing, hoovering, ironing, you name it. I find it very therapeutic.","There have been times in my life when I have felt like I can't go out without my makeup on. But now I just put on some dark glasses so people can't see if I look rough!","I have quite a lot of anxiety dreams.","I went on two holidays as a child. It wasn't what people did where I grew up.","I am not into action and adventure on holiday; that doesn't really do it for me. I would much rather go and lie down.","My children have been all over the world, and I think it's so good for them: expanding their horizons and imagination and seeing how other people live.","'Upstairs Downstairs' and 'Downton Abbey' appeal to people because they're about our history, they look so beautiful, are written by amazing writers and have high production values.","I'm a total stationery fiend - I have drawers and drawers of lovely printed cards and wrapping paper.","The Turkish people are the friendliest I've ever met.","I worked in McDonald's, but I didn't mind it. You got free cheeseburgers. I love eating a bit of junk food.","Children will be children, and they're inquisitive. If teenagers want to know what's out there, they'll look, but there are things that aren't for their eyes.","I was never one of those teenagers who sang into their hairbrush.","I don't punish myself. Life's too short."],"Keenen Ivory Wayans":["There are two phases to a movie. First you shoot the movie, and then you make the movie. Generally, post-production is longer than filming.","Creativity is the answer. I always prefer the creative solution to an expensive solution.","Slot machines are like crack for old people.","I put the cameras on her and told her to be obnoxious as she could possibly could be. She was.","I go through a whole process with the actors first, building and creating characters, then I encourage them to sort of live in that character when they're in the screen.","I like to have fun and be funny, but I'm much more of a thinker.","You just can't make any movie and it will be good now. This is a really a difficult time to be in films.","All I need is a camera and I'll make things happen.","I'm just calm under fire. I'm not intimidating at all.","I always prefer the big laugh. That is always the objective, especially with a film like Scary Movie 2.","I enjoy the character interplay. Sometimes the audience is not laughing, but smiling, and that is almost just as good because it keeps them ready to laugh.","I have been a director who has starred, participated on both sides of the filmmaking process.","I prefer the smaller budget versus the bigger budget because the mentality that goes along with big budget filmmaking doesn't really suit me; the mind-set that money is the answer.","I put heavy emphasis on the characters.","I think a lot comes from having the experience of doing stand-up comedy. It allows you to figure out the psychology of an audience; what things are funny and not.","I throw it all in there, Kung Fu, blaxploitation, horror.","I'm not on all the time. I like to have fun and be funny, but I'm much more of a thinker.","In rare instances you have to give up what you thought was a great scene.","It's rare that you cut out something that is really good. You screen all of it, and when the audience doesn't respond, you cut out whatever is holding the story down.","It's the teenage and university crowd, so we give them lots of sex jokes and gross humour.","Just making a good movie is hard to do.","My brothers can be a little out of control sometimes and so somebody has to be able to keep them focused.","The pressures having grown up in this business can be really rough. And it is a testament to you that you have remained focused and NOT lost your mind.","This is really a difficult time to be in films.","We do nods to Charlie's Angels and Mission Impossible because they are popular with our fan base.","We felt like we had done as much as you can do with the slasher genre. We were trying to find the next group of scary movies that were ripe for parody.","We've seen so many films now, that you have to be on par with the best films that have preceded you. You just can't make any movie and it will be good.","You can kind of feel when things are going to work out.","You do what it takes. It was on me to deliver.","You never really know until you put the movie in front of an audience. I am a big advocate of screenings, which are getting harder and harder to do nowadays."],"Keerthy Suresh":["My collections are a reflection of my personality, and the satisfaction I get from wearing my own designs is indescribable.","Someday I will get married, and I should be able to watch my films with my children, mother-in-law, and father-in-law.","I'm happy to work in Malayalam.","I am quite a dreamer, and usually when someone tells a story, I tend to get distracted easily.","I have never wanted to leave Malayalam films.","I'd like a balance of class and mass films.","It gives me a lot of joy when I wear my design at a show and someone asks me who designed my costume.","Whatever big movie I work in, ultimately my concern is my personality. I make sure that I keep it up.","My family is very conservative.","I have never behaved like a star kid, and since a lot of people in the Tamil and Malayalam film industries know my parents, they treat me like their own child.","I always wanted to be an actress, but my parents were adamant that I complete my studies first before I take up acting.","More than comparing with somebody else, I'd prefer comparing my own work from film to film.","I believe each actor is versatile and different, so you can't compare them.","All I need to worry about is have I done better than my previous film or not.","I always wanted to act, but not because my parents were associated with the industry.","I don't think about my past or future.","I don't know if I am going to become an A-lister tomorrow.","I don't take up too many projects at a time. I choose with care. I guess that clarity comes because my parents are from the industry.","I don't want to be part of movies where I just sing and dance and go away.","I like to prepare for my roles well, so you can call me a method actor to an extent.","I always believe in the projects I do.","Even though my earlier film 'Idhu Yenna Mayam' didn't do well, I got a lot of good feedback.","The modern girl I played in 'Idhu'... came quite naturally to me.","I studied in Kerala, so learnt to read and write Malayalam.","In Tamil, the actors have to take care of themselves quite well and that is something I am all set to be serious about.","If I am offered good roles, I will definitely be back in Malayalam, anytime.","Tamil industry has been offering me wonderful roles, and that is what keeps me here.","My parents themselves had a love marriage.","After my schooling, I was not thrilled by the idea of treading the usual doctor-engineer line. I wanted to pursue something artistic, and I was good at drawing. The options before me were architecture, fashion, and interior designing.","I would love to grab roles like the ones my mom did in 'Oppol' or the role Kangana Ranaut played in 'Queen.'","I had trained a bit in Bharatanatyam in the past but did not learn in depth. The same goes with jazz, western, and cinematic dance, as I was quite laid back with the training.","Fashion designing involves a lot of work, and, as opposed to the general perception, it is different from costume designing for films. While a fashion designer can take up a costume designer's role, it is not possible vice versa.","I can speak Tamil fluently, and the sentence structures in Telugu are quite similar.","When I tell people that I am acting in Telugu, they ask me if I have to overact.","Whenever someone asks me to name a dream hero or pair, I always end up getting Bollywood names in my mind.","Going to a theatre and watching yourself on the big screen is a nightmare.","I'm the greatest critic of my work.","The idea is to choose good roles and good movies. I don't want to act simply to remain in the industry, nor am I here to do glamour roles.","If I get to do only 10 roles, then I should be remembered for all the ten roles.","I've never been jealous of any girl in my life, but while shooting for 'Remo,' I was 'really jealous' of Sivakarthikeyan. The day I saw him in his pretty nurse look, I knew that he's going to steal the show.","It was a great experience to work with director A. L. Vijay.","I am not concentrating on any industry but just taking up good offers, which gives me scope to perform.","I don't have the time to design my own costumes, but I do give suggestions and style tips.","Luckily, neither in my Tamil nor in my Telugu movies do I have roles that require exaggerated emoting."],"Keeth Smart":["Being properly prepared is one of the biggest assets in business and in athletic competition.","In my job, whenever I delivered a presentation I would rehearse several times before the actual event. In sport, it is important to be equally prepared about my opponents.","Some of my competitors overlook the importance of knowing as much as possible about their opponents, but I think that it is an invaluable asset that I have gained from working.","I've always dreamed of an Olympic medal.","Brooklyn is a very weird borough."],"Kehlani":["Success to me is only two things: happiness and stability.","I used to think that love was giving up everything of yourself and giving it to the other person. Now, I've realized that love is when you have somebody that doesn't make you give up half of yourself.","I think most people don't know that I really write everything myself. No help. There's nobody in the studio except for me and the engineer. A lot of people don't think I'm a singer. They think I'm a rapper.","I feel like I don't really care about impressing other people. I thoroughly enjoy impressing myself.","As far as creation goes, you just really have to not overthink and just create and be confident. If you think it's tight, then the world is going to think it's tight.","Me being so open just helps other people. People feel like they know me so much that they can talk to me all of the time about really personal things. Sometimes it's really nice and comforting. It depends on the person, whether they're creepy or not.","Sex is biological, but gender is mental.","I think, as musicians, our music should be who we are. Sometimes it's not - it's someone else's. All heartfelt music and all honest music, it's who we are. Of course, our upbringing has everything to do with it.","There's girls that grew up like me and even worse, and they need to know that there is someone out there that can give them hope with my music. It's about inspiring people and helping people.","Stardom is a crazy thought. If that's what my path is, then that's where I'm excited to be headed towards.","I've always been a very young person with a very old soul.","You start singing by singing what you hear. So everyone, when they first start singing, they naturally are singing like whatever they're hearing, because that's the only way you learned how to sing. So when I was growing up on Lauryn Hill, when I started singing her songs, I literally trained my voice to be able to do runs.","When you look at me, you can't really tell what I am, but I'm black, white, Native, Spanish, and a little bit of Filipino.","I went from broke and homeless sleeping on couches. Couldn't even figure out what I was doing in Los Angeles. Now, I'm paying my own bills. I'm about to move my mama in with me at 19. I'm on tour now, and this is all off of one mixtape.","I hang out with the right people, my friends that I've had since the beginning. We go to the beach, take walks, paint, see our family - just normal things that people who become famous lose sight of.","I want babies before I'm 25. I want to bring my babies on the road and bring them to concerts and raise them in the studio.","When I started singing, I was covering Lauryn Hill, Brandy, and all the girl groups of the '90s. It's just what I would listen to and what I was singing when anybody asked me to sing for them.","If my eyebrows are cool, if my eyeliner is popping, if I'm moisturized, then I can pretty much wear whatever I want. I think if your hair and your face are together, I think it's pretty much polished!","I'm a healthy eater, but I don't consider Chick-fil-A fast food.","I just remember falling in love with the old Chris Brown music, where it was, like, that real R&B, and I love the radio smashes he's put out since then, but I go back to his older music for that R&B.","I was in art school, and we had all these random classes. We'd listen to a lot of Bollywood. I'd listen to Spanish music - and I don't even speak Spanish, but Hector Lavoe is amazing - we listened to French music like Edith Piaf. She's tight. I like cool vocal inflections; I like cool sounds. I pretty much listen to anything I think is good.","I think writing and singing go together, but I treat them as two separate careers because I write for others. If I'm writing for myself, I prefer to be with the producer. And then we can vibe out and throw ideas back and forth, and I'll basically let the producer play me a bunch of beats until I vibe with one.","It's funny: I don't listen to too much rap. I don't listen to too much older hip-hop. If I do, it's Ja Rule.","My biggest role model right now is Beyonce, just 'cause she is a very, very strong, powerful woman, and that's obviously the number one reason to be inspired by her. She is just killing every game there is to kill.","I was out of the house at 16 by my own doing. It forced me to really grow up and take care of myself, and I learned a lot of things that your parents usually teach you, on my own.","My pops passed when I was little. I didn't have a dad around to tell me certain things. I didn't have my biological mother.","I think my main two songs are 'FWU' and 'Get Away.' 'FWU' made a cool point because it came out right after Chris Brown's 'Loyal' came out. I combated it with 'FWU,' a song that basically says, 'These women are loyal.'","If I was to have a reality show, it wouldn't be a show based on my personal life. I'd want it to showcase me and my girls on tour, like living life as a young artist, not exposing what goes on in my family situations.","I write most of my songs to beats. I play around on guitar, but not enough to where I can compose my own stuff or play solos. I can accompany myself 'cause most songs are, like, four chords.","My brain kind of works in steps. I have to go through things and then process them and then write about them. I have to understand them first.","Sometimes I make songs about girls, and I say 'he,' or I'll make songs about guys, and I say 'she,' or sometimes they're exactly what they're about. I feel like it just allows me to get a lot more perspective."],"Keifer Thompson":["You always rebel what your parents want you to listen to.","If it wasn't for the fans I would probably be bartending somewhere.","When you know who you are as an artist and you have your own identity and got it figured out it helps you know what to write about.","It is always easier to write from the heart and deal with things in the present.","I think it is your job as an artist to be able to hear a song."],"Keiko Agena":["Being on a successful show is kind of like being a sea turtle. Every year, sea turtles lay hundreds and hundreds of eggs, but only a few manage to survive and mature. It's the same with TV pilots. There are so many great ideas, but for whatever reason only the lucky ones get picked up.","I am really fortunate to have parents who supported my plan to become an actress when I was a little kid. And then there was my grandma. She was the best. She was always there and ready to drive me to all my plays and stuff.","Ever since I found out I got the part on 'Gilmore Girls,' my life has been changing in so many ways. It seems as though all we get is good news. I'm just so grateful to be a part of it. It's a wholesome show with an edge. I have no idea how we pull it off."],"Keir Dullea":["I think the life we are living now is just a blink in the eye of eternity.","Kubrick never explained the ending to us, or what his intentions were. He didn't intend for it to be a predictable film.","For me the most moving moment came when I first started working on 2001. I was already in awe of him, and he had very much already become Stanley Kubrick by the time the film started.","I play a recurring role for a character named Doctor Imo. I assist the villain and show up from time to time."],"Keir Gilchrist":["I like camping.","I guess Johnny Depp has a pretty good career. I love a lot of parts that actors have played, so I love pieces of their career, but it's pretty hard to look at an actor's whole career and go, 'That was awesome!' Usually it either ends on a crappy show or with no work at all.","I don't think I was anything short of ecstatic when I found out 'It's Kind of a Funny Story' would be premiering in Toronto.","I'm the sort of actor who doesn't really prep a lot - I don't do a lot of research for parts. I just go for it, and I usually pull through.","When I create a character, I do it with the directors, and I take their notes and try to have my notes meet in a common ground. I don't create characters myself, and I don't really think that's my job. I'm not a prep person at all - plus, I'm just a lazy procrastinator."],"Keira Knightley":["I see the world through my eyes. It's sometimes a strange world.","I don't think that you can fake warmth. You can fake lust, jealousy, anger; those are all quite easy. But actual, genuine warmth? I don't think you can fake it.","If only I wasn't an atheist, I could get away with anything. You'd just ask for forgiveness and then you'd be forgiven. It sounds much better than having to live with guilt.","All through my life what I've loved doing is watching movies. I love the escapism of film, I love stories. So it is incredible to be able to be in them as much as I am, to see them from the first stitch in a costume to the end product.","Film is a much lonelier process than theatre. You really don't have any rehearsal time in film. You don't shape it together... with theatre, there is a complete kind of family atmosphere. The sociable side of this business is the theatrical side, it really isn't the film side.","Well, the thing about great fictional characters from literature, and the reason that they're constantly turned into characters in movies, is that they completely speak to what makes people human.","It's an interesting thing when you discover something about yourself. To go: 'Wow, I'm not the person I thought I was. I'm in the middle of something and I can't actually deal with it.'","It's not everyday you get to do a pirate movie, you might as well go for it.","At this particular time, I probably am more comfortable with myself. Just now I'm having a lovely time.","If only I wasn't an atheist, I could get away with anything.","I really believe that in this industry women have to be very true to themselves about what they're comfortable with.","I tried college for three months but I was desperately unhappy. I just wanted to perform. I was getting straight As but I had no friends and cried every day.","You already feel unsure of yourself, and then you see your worst fears in print. It really knocked me - which is why, I think, I was working, working, working, because I was trying to run away from the fact that I thought I couldn't do it.","I'm doing a film now with a lot of guys as well, so at the end of that I will be growing a beard.","I don't have a problem with my body. I'm not just going to strip off all my clothing, but if the part calls for it and I don't think there's any way round, I'm absolutely fine.","It's fantastic to have the opportunity to work abroad, and do all that, but there is a certain point where you're just like, 'Oh, I'd love to work at home.'","It's impossible. You try to have any kind of relationship with your family, with a man, or with a friend, and you have to be on the phone and the Internet the entire time.","My upbringing is why I am the person I am today. I have very wise parents.","I always find it much easier when there's one person whose vision you're following, as opposed to many people.","I didn't know this about myself, but when 'Pirates of the Caribbean' came out I realised that I didn't enjoy a huge amount of recognition. I didn't react to it well, but I think life is about finding out who you are and what you like. So I started doing independent movies and art-house films instead.","When I was about 5 I think, I desperately wanted to be a pirate and have the hat and everything.","I like watching films when I don't know anything about the people.","I think every girl is looking for her Mr. Darcy.","It's all about perfection, isn't it?","It's good to know that other people think differently, and that's what makes the characters interesting.","I find more interesting roles for women in period pieces. I do personally like watching period films; I think you can really get lost in the fantasy of them.","My mum says that I was born 45, and I do remember at six thinking that I should be earning my own living.","I started working when I was seven, and ever since then I've been saving for an apartment. Even before that I had a little jam jar designated for my apartment money.","Nice is the worst word.","I don't think I can call myself an actress yet. I just don't think my skill level is that high. I hope that with every job it gets better. But until I'm good, I can say I'm trying to be an actor, but I don't think I've completely made it.","And we're fortunate if we have parents who are great and loving and inspiring. But, unfortunately, there are people who don't have that.","But acting is very much a profession that is you're hot one moment and not the next - and that is totally cool. I think that's what I find most fascinating and most exciting about it - is that it can be gone in a puff of smoke.","What's nice about playing somebody real is that generally there's more information about them, so a lot of the questions that you'd otherwise have to make up the answers to are already there.","I cook. I go to farmers markets in London and cook really good sort of organic foods.","I find it quite difficult on studio films because there are so many different executives and things like that that you have to go through, so very often getting that definitive opinion is actually quite difficult.","I think everybody has the right to a private life.","I am a slow reader. I always loved words, which is a strange thing given that I couldn't actually read them.","I wasn't allowed to do commercials. I wasn't allowed to do TV series. I wasn't allowed to do soaps or basically anything that would mean I missed too much school.","I made a conscious decision to live my life the best way I could and that meant to publicise myself as little as possible."],"Keisha Castle-Hughes":["I absolutely love being a mother. It's been a blessing. It's fun and it's hard, but it's absolutely amazing.","Thanks to a lot of people, not just myself, 'Whale Rider' had an amazing impact emotionally, and people remember it. I count myself very lucky that all those doors were unlocked, I just had to open them.","I've lived a fast-paced life, but I had the best childhood. I didn't miss out on anything by having my daughter at a young age.","I want to be a science teacher. My friends asked me why, but I'm intrigued by it and I'm quite good at science at school.","Your private life should be private. I reckon that's a good thing that you talk about your work and you talk about what you're doing, but without having to go into how your brother's been and how your mum's been because none of that's really relevant.","When I found out this was going to be the last 'Star Wars' film that was ever going to be made, I felt pretty privileged to be in it.","I come from a big family, so I'd like to have a big family.","I was able to grow up and do silly things and have a life with only a small amount of public scrutiny."],"Keith B. Alexander":["I see no reason to use offensive tools unless you're defending the country or in a state of war, or you want to achieve some really important thing for the good of the nation and others.","We followed the law, we follow our policies, we self-report, we identify problems, we fix them. And I think we do a great job, and we do, I think, more to protect people's civil liberties and privacy than they'll ever know."],"Keith Barry":["I can do lightning mathematics quicker than somebody can do them on a calculator.","Besides what I do, I love fishing; I love bringing my children to the forest, getting outdoors in nature. Get outside, people! Stop looking at screens.","Some computers have security software that make it impossible to hack into, and it's the same with brains - some malfunction, and some, you can't hack into them at all.","I pray in my own way, not regularly, and I wouldn't say structured prayers. What I'm praying to I'm not sure. I'd be a firm agnostic.","With brain hacking experiments, I've hacked into Morgan Freeman's brain. He was the most famous and the most nerve wracking because I got really awestruck when I met him, and the moment I was introduced to him, he challenged me there and then to hack his brain.","I want to bring magic back to where it started, which is not about the props, and it's not about me as a magician: it's about the audience and playing with their minds and playing with their perception of magic and having fun with it.","The cosmetics world and mentalism are both arenas of deception, but I suppose the difference is that mentalists and magicians are more honest about it. People tell me I have good skin, and I tell them the magic secret is E45 cream: cheap, cheerful, and very effective.","I mixed hypnosis and magic together to try and create a new area. I'm not trying to reinvent the wheel.","Magic is all about directing attention. If I didn't want you to look at my right hand then I don't look at it.","Anyone can learn a trick, but to make it entertaining, to put a presentation twist on it, and then to take it out there and really amaze people is a whole different ball game. You have to have some kind of a natural ability to do that, I suppose.","How does the subconscious mind work? Is it independent of the conscious mind? Is it programmed by experiences or instructions? Many questions come up, but the one answer is common: if you can access the subconscious, then you can reprogram it, period!","There's a lot of different styles of hypnosis. There's conversational hypnosis, which, even though we joke about it, politicians use conversational hypnosis. I've been hired back at home in Ireland by certain politicians to assist them in specific language patterns that will just tip people over into their, you know, into their zone.","Needless to say, my stunts take years to perfect and are closely monitored by a team of trained professionals at all times, so no one should ever think about trying to re-create them.","Once you've hypnotised someone once, you can pretty much put them under instantly any time you meet them afterwards.","When you have a traumatic experience, you look at your mindset.","Studying neuro-linguistic programming is what teaches you how to implant and extract thoughts. Mixing psychology, hypnotism and magic somewhat goes into this area called mentalism, which is what I mostly do. It's magic of the mind.","If someone is lying to you, they'll generally look up to the top right. That means that they're trying to construct an image that doesn't exist.","I don't pretend that I can read minds. I don't believe anybody can read minds. In other words, I don't believe in psychics.","By combining elements such as hypnosis, magic, neurolinguistic programming and psychology, I can make it appear that I can hack into people's brains.","Some brains are easy to hack into, and other brains are nearly impossible to hack into because they are so complex.","I like pushing the envelope. I like pushing myself and the audience, whether it's a TV show or live. I like to throw people over the edge of the cliff and scare the wits out of them, but then pull them back and make them safe.","Once people enjoy what I do, I don't mind if they call me a magician or an illusionist or a hypnotist, entertainer, comedian, whatever people want to call me. I'm comfortable with all of the above, so I don't really mind at all what people want to call me.","For me, I live for performing live because people look at magicians on television, and they always wonder, 'Is it a camera trick?' 'Is it a stooge?' whereas, live, they know there's no set-ups; there's no stooges.","I love reading about new advances in my industry. I love feeding my brain.","We all go to the gym, and we're thinking about how we look and what we're eating, but our brain is a muscle, and you have to train it!","I have been working with people on an individual basis for years to help them break habits and deal with anxiety. I've helped people with everything from fears, phobias, and stress right the way through to eczema - anything that is governed by our psyche and inner psychology.","I'm pretty much self-taught - I never went to any courses. If I want to learn about, say, the frontal lobe, I'll buy 40 books and absorb them in a couple of weeks. I'm a nerd like that.","Sometimes I implant thoughts, sometimes I extract thoughts, but I don't like to explain it too much. It's based on science, deduction, and reasoning - it's a bit like what 'Sherlock' does, except that's a dramatised version. I look at every clue around me.","You need to talk like your boss and copy their actions. Like, if they cross their legs, you do the same. If people think you're like them, you're more inclined to get what you want out of them.","Psychics prey on the vulnerable of society. They look like they're contacting the other side, but they're not, and they're interfering with the natural grieving process that everyone has to go through.","Dave Franco, I could put him up there with the best card throwers in the world. Not the best sleight of hand, but he could take a card and fire it over there and stick it into an apple. If he kept training at it, he could definitely break a Guinness World Record - he's that good.","I'm not saying I do evil things. I'm just saying if a cop stops me when I'm speeding, sometimes - not all the time - I might get out of that ticket. Let's just say I don't have any points on my licence in Ireland, and I drive relatively quickly.","I don't believe I'm psychic, but if I can get people to focus on a specific thought, I can hack into brains and figure out what they're thinking.","I believe everyone has the ability to be hypnotised, and I think, on different days, different people will have varying levels of susceptibility.","Hypnosis is about shutting down the conscious mind and re-igniting the unconscious and the imagination, so while I give instructions to them under hypnosis, the contestants might interpret those instructions in all kinds of ways.","My first TV show was 2003. You wouldn't be in the game this long if you were using stooges and actors and all that kind of stuff; quite honestly, the answer is we don't need them.","Our ethos for 'Now You See Me 2' was that everything in the movie at least had the potential to be done in real life, and I'd say over 90% of it was actually done in-camera with no CGI. Of course, movies like this are always going to be bound by the rules of Hollywood, being there's going to be enhancements of CGI.","You see guys going up to girls in bars and saying, 'Oh, can I show you a trick?' It's a tool. I find it kind of sad; it breaks my heart a little bit. They should try to use their own personalities. It sort of smacks of using magic as a crutch, which is not what it should be.","I remember hearing Will Smith, back when he was just a rapper, saying, 'When all the other rap stars are in bed, I'm practicing my rapping.' I try to be like that. There is always something to improve.","I am constantly asked can anyone be hypnotized, and does it really work? Yes, and it does.","In 2006, when doing a live stage show in Ireland, I tried for the first time to instantly induct a subject on stage, something I had never done before, nor did I know if it would ever work. The result almost cost me my career; the man I grabbed and instantly inducted went out cold and fell to the floor.","Strive for extraordinary, don't moan, and sleep when you're dead.","I have to stay in shape for the physical endeavour stunts I do. I work out a lot. I have a personal trainer. I go two or three times a week. I'm on a diet where I photograph everything I eat and send it to her.","I'm a terrible sleeper because I work all the time. I stay up late almost every night working, whether it's on a TV or live show. I come up with new ideas, do research, watch loads of TED talks, or find psychology articles.","I don't like people being negative, whining, or moaning. If you're in a situation you're not in control of, just change.","We're able to use certain techniques to get people to behave in certain ways. We're able to use certain techniques to make it look like we're reading minds, even though we're not.","If you write your own material and perform your own material, then nobody can really expose it because if you keep your secrets close to yourself, then nobody can really expose you.","I haven't hypnotised a whole lot of celebrities, because they're fearful of it.","I wanted to develop a hypnosis show that no-one had ever seen before, so I made it very topical and interesting. I've created a UFC fight night every night on stage, where I hypnotise twenty people into thinking they're mad, crazed UFC fans, and the energy is unbelievable.","I think to get Simon Cowell out of his comfort zone would be rather interesting. I don't know what I would make him do.","Let's just say I don't have any points on my licence, and I drive quickly sometimes.","I haven't done anything I regret; I don't live for regrets. I'm not a mean person, so I don't go around doing evil things to people.","I buy so much when I go through airports: I buy psychology magazines; I buy 'Mind,' another magazine, 'New Scientist,' 'Scientific America.'","I stock up on nuts, protein shakes, protein bars, seeds, and have them everywhere - the car, wherever - for when I'm on the move.","I remember meeting my manager Eamonn for the very first time, and one of the first things he said to me was, 'You're fat. The first thing you need to go is get to a gym.' It was quite a wake-up call. I got a bit angry initially, like, 'The cheek of him', but I'm quite a pragmatic and thick-skinned person, so I just went ahead and joined the gym.","If you look at the first TV stuff I did years ago, I've a pretty chubby look about me. I went at it quite hard in the gym at the time. If any footage of me ever came out from those days, I would genuinely die. I did step aerobics to lose the weight, and then I literally ran and ran the weight off on a treadmill.","I've trained with trainers in L.A., and they get complacent. They're used to dealing with celebrity egos, so they cotton-wool you a bit.","If you've got creativity, imagination, and intelligence, and you want to be hypnotised, then there's no reason you shouldn't be able to.","If you feel depressed, go and buy twenty books about depression. Learn about it; find out how it works.","There has to be a level of intuition involved in what I do, and the more you use that intuition, the more honed it is."],"Keith Belling":["Marketing is a core part of anything you do.","My passion for snacking and search for a great tasting, better-for-you snack sparked my interest in creating what has become popchips.","I'm a snacker, but also health-conscious. I thought there had to be an alternative to what was out there. But it had to taste good - if it doesn't taste good, it isn't a snack.","The influencer strategy hasn't been built around celebrities. We're looking for influencers within every marketplace, who are the people who help influence decision-makers within that community.","We have 11 great potato flavors, and customers have been clamoring for tortilla. For over a year, we worked to develop the four flavors of tortilla popchips: chili limon, nacho cheese, ranch and salsa. They're made with traditional stoneground masa, are gluten-free, and have less than half the fat of other chips.","When I went to visit this rice cake plant, I hadn't realized how the rice cakes were made. As soon as I saw the molds of rice and how the heat pops it like popcorn, the light bulb went off. This is popped. This isn't baked or fried.","I hope popchips will be the Vitaminwater of the snack aisle.","I answer every single e-mail that comes in myself.","You have to have a ton of passion for what you're doing because being an entrepreneur is probably twice as hard as you think it's going to be. The good news is that it's probably twice as much fun when it's going well.","I love fried chips, but they weren't good for you, and I didn't like the healthy options like rice chips.","There's a deli around the corner from my office where I'd get a bag of chips with my sandwich, and I was hiding them under my sandwich because I was embarrassed. When I had this epiphany that I was hiding the potato chips from myself, I realized there was an opportunity there.","We focused on getting popchips into the hands of tastemakers and influencers wherever they were, from the fashionistas at Mercedes Benz fashion week to the passengers on Virgin Airlines.","I'm definitely a serial entrepreneur and a serial snacker. And when it comes to snacks, I'm more of a salty snacker, though I've been known to have a craving for sweets from time to time.","Like a lot of snackers, I recognized that snacking is an indulgence and is all about taste.","Everyone on our team shares a couple passions - putting the fun back in snacking, an entrepreneurial spiriting, and the passion for creating an innovative and exciting brand - all of which makes popchips a really fun place to work these days.","My focus has always been on connecting with consumers in a meaningful way.","Once consumers try popchips, most people really like it and become fans.","We just wanted to do a chip that tasted great, but wasn't bad for you.","Potatoes are popped, with no oil, using the same technology used in the rice cake manufacturing business. It took a lot of trial and error and lots of practice, though, to get the right flavor.","We have a broad range of snackers - moms, kids and healthy active people.","You can't rest on your laurels. You have to continue to innovate; you have to continue to be different.","We came out with a rice and a corn chip, then quickly decided we needed to focus on potato. It was just too much for consumers to figure out at once.","I was convinced you were not able to tell a consumer you can have a healthy fried chip or a good-tasting baked chip.","I knew I shouldn't be eating fried chips, but I'm just not a fan of baked chips, as much as I tried them."],"Keith Carradine":["I've grown this mustache which saves me from having to glue on one every day in the heat.","When you get all this stuff on and you put on the guns and the hair, it has an effect on the actor. It tends to lend a certain something to the way you feel as you're just walking around looking that way.","The Western genre is certainly something with which I'm familiar.","I like the Western genre, I think it's uniquely American.","He was definitely known as the foremost man killer in the West; however there's controversy about virtually every killing that he was known to have been involved in.","But I love to be outdoors. I prefer being outdoors to, you know, being inside.","And so I love films that are kind of rural in atmosphere. And you know, it's just a nice place to be day after day. All be it, it can be hard, it can be hard work. You can get hot."],"Keith Coogan":["I cuss like a sailor; I smoked cigarettes for many years but quit and have never looked back; also, I ride a motorcycle... in Los Angeles... so there ya go.","I was watching 'Mr. Roger's Neighborhood', 'Sesame Street', 'Electric Company', 'Romper Room', and 'Villa Alegre!' when I said to my self, 'Hey, self! Wouldn't it be fun to be one of those kids on the TV?' My mom thought it was a pretty good idea, too... and she instantly moved us from the Bay Area to Malibu... nice.","At first, we lived in very, very small places... with my mom cleaning houses and scrounging up just enough to keep us in town with a working car. She introduced me to my first agent, and I started with stand-in work, then eventually commercials and television guest-shots.","I would advise anyone seriously interested in acting to study, train, and work as much as possible... You will know soon enough if it's the right avenue for you.","That is one of the first things my family, my mother and my grandfather, had taught me about acting: 'Use your eyes!' Not being able to do that physical aspect of it, and having to put it all into your voice? That was a little bit of a challenge.","I have been a Jack Albertson fan forever.","I started out as Keith Mitchell. I had done probably about ten years of television work under that name. Then my grandfather passed away in 1984. I wanted to honor him and his name.","For one year, I was Keith Mitchell Coogan on my headshots. The next year, I was just Keith Coogan. And I have gone by that ever since, maybe 1984 or 1985. That is my mother's maiden name, and it was out of reverence for my grandfather."],"Keith David":["What has been happening more lately - of course, I also put in my bio, I say I do the voice of Goliath, but some people go - you know, I say something, and it's a funny thing when you work in this business, people will talk out loud in front of you like you're not there.","I came out singing, the doctor slapped me on the head, and I started singing.","Actually, I wanted to be an actor when I was two years old.","And it has some weight, I mean, the whole history of the gargoyles, that's some wonderful stuff.","But Gargoyles, bar none, is the most fun I've ever had in life.","I am working on my nightclub act, definitely want to do more singing.","I don't think they're going to pay me to play Mufasa.","I loved old movies as a kid, so I always watched old movies.","In fact, I have never met anyone who didn't like Gargoyles.","It can't hurt, publicity is publicity, controversy and all that, it's all good.","My whole life, I always wanted to be an actor.","Well, you know, I played Mufasa in the workshop of The Lion King."],"Keith Ellison":["Not voting is not a protest. It is a surrender.","While there are corporal descriptions of what the afterlife is like in Christianity, Islam and Judaism, what's going on there is the finite trying to describe the infinite. If God knows everything, started everything and is the only one who knows how it's going to end, how can any human know what God wants?","If people want to protest, to get out there and express themselves, as long as they do it peacefully, they should be encouraged to do so.","I have always been a fierce fighter against anti-Semitism. I oppose it and always have.","You have to knock doors, make calls, and build a relationship with voters long before Election Day.","I know a lot of police officers who are on the force to do the right thing to protect people. But how can you deny this pattern, this disturbing pattern, Alton Sterling, Mr. Castile in my own community, Philando Castile, but then Tamir Rice, Mike Brown, Eric Garner, Sandra Bland?","Our democracy is not something to be taken for granted. You have to fight for it. You have to commit yourself to working for it - for the long haul.","At the end of the day, the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott had to be converted into the 1964 Civil Rights Act. We don't want politicians who've gotta be coaxed, cajoled and protested. We want them on our side from the beginning.","Clean air and a healthy climate benefit all of us, but it will take a diverse coalition to step up to the threat posed by unchecked climate change.","A Republican philosophy goes something like this: If you take your car to the mechanic, and instead of fixing it, they take out the engine and charge you an arm and a leg, you should conclude that mechanics can't fix cars and you should probably just take yours to the junkyard and sell it for scrap metal.","You approach faith with humility. You can have some idea, but it boils down to do you see religion as a club, or do you see religion as a path? Do you see it as a wall that separates you or do you see it as a bridge that connects you to God and other people? When you see it as a bridge, you aren't so worried about bringing others over to your side.","We must invest in and empower our state and local parties by creating effective field operations, an enhanced and advanced voter file, and a culture of collaboration between candidates at every level. Let's put the voters first.","Why can't we get real, sane, sensible gun legislation? Because the NRA, funded by Mossberg, Smith & Wesson, Glock and all the rest of the big dogs in the weapons industry, you know, spread around donations and won't let it move through.","I believe that Israel and the U.S.-Israel relationship are, and should be, key considerations in shaping U.S. policy in the Middle East. Americans with roots or interests in the region should be involved in advocacy and discussions of public policy concerning the region.","The middle class should not continue to foot the bill for tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires.","Those who seek the divine want to make this world a better place, which first requires that we communicate.","We need a strong farm bill that gives assistance to farmers during times of drought, creates markets for local goods, protects our environment, and helps struggling families bridge the gap between hard times and a full dinner table.","Republicans profess to be against deficits, but they are experts at creating and exacerbating deficits.","People spend money on negative campaigning because it works.","I'm an energetic person. I work hard.","Throughout my work as a state legislator and member of Congress since 2002, I have worked as hard as I could to build bridges. I've worked to combat anti-Semitism and confront Holocaust denial. I've organized dozens of meetings to promote interfaith dialogue and joint projects.","My mom, Clida, taught my four brothers and me about her father's work to organize black voters in rural Louisiana in the 1950s. We carried her dad's legacy of activism with us. The Civil Rights Movement was present in the daily life of my family in Detroit in the 1970s.","There must be something in the water in Minnesota because historically, despite its seemingly homogeneous population, the state has produced some of our more radical political thinkers, and its people have put their prejudices aside to vote for them.","When you're a leader, you cannot ignore parts of your constituency, even if you know they're not going to vote for you.","Environmental spending creates jobs in engineering, manufacturing, construction, materials, operations and maintenance.","Vehicle emissions standards directly sparked the development and application of a wide range of automotive technologies that are now found throughout the global automobile market.","If you can make a movie, make one. If you can sing a song, sing it. If you can write a play, write it. If you want to run for office, run. But do something to make this world a better place.","Middle class families should not be forced to scrape by with less while oil companies get away with more.","Americans used to be able to depend on their jobs to provide a stable retirement.","Every now and again, people on the far right take a quote from a progressive out of context and use it to attack them.","We're Americans - in times of crisis, we step up.","Progressive economic policies lead to a sustainable economy.","Progressive policies implemented since the early 1900s launched America into the modern age and created a vibrant middle class.","I'm not against T.V. advertising for campaigns, but we need to emphasize field campaigning much more than we do.","Democrats need an organizer who will energize the grass-roots across this country to build the party from the bottom up.","I support Israel. And I have long supported a two-state solution and a democratic and secure state for the Jewish people, with a democratic and viable Palestinian state side-by-side in peace and dignity.","I was born and raised in Detroit.","Serving my neighbors in Congress and fighting for them has been the best job I've ever had.","When I started running for Congress, it actually took me by surprise that so many people were fascinated with me being the first Muslim in Congress.","I would really like to hear somebody who is really articulate about the elements of their faith conversion. I'm not.","My faith and my identity as a Muslim - I never saw it as something that made my job harder. It's just an aspect of who I am.","Faith really should be a bridge, not a wall. Because at the end of the day, we should be focusing on what you believe, not what your religion is.","I understand the risks associated with being a soldier. But I think as members of Congress, we should not intensify the chance that we'll have to commit troops to a military conflict unless it's absolutely necessary to defend the nation.","I think that anybody who is going to be the standard-bearer, the spokesman for the progressive movement, in the context of a presidential race, has got to learn to master the language and really get their finger on the pulse of how people are feeling. I think that's really important.","I'm not a scholar of Islamic history or jurisprudence or anything.","I've never gotten up in front of a Muslim congregation and played the role of a religious leader, and I decline those invitations because that's not what I am.","When I hear about these terrorist ideologies, they are completely foreign and strange to me. I mean, to me, it's, like, antithetical.","The United States' job is not to police the whole world.","Pragmatism is not always a good thing. Experience is not always a good thing.","People will politicize religion; we see it in every faith, in every religion. We see it with Pat Robertson, in my opinion, and we see it with the Taliban.","I try to live tolerance in my own way, which is why, as a politician, one of my key priorities is to stand up for human rights.","When voters know what Democrats stand for, we can improve the lives of all Americans, no matter their race, religion or sexual orientation.","All I'd like to say is that I am a patriotic, loyal American. I love my country and the values that it stands for. And I am a Muslim.","Anybody that's ever been to Israel and to Palestine knows that you can't look at a person and tell if they're Israeli or Palestinian. You can assume. But I've seen Palestinians who look Swedish, and I've seen Israelis who are black.","I study these bills. I read them carefully. If it makes sense, I'll sign on them. If not, I don't.","How are we all going to pitch in to fix this party to make working America know that the Democratic party is absolutely on their side? That's the real question.","The truth is that we have got to make America work for working people again.","I'd tell you whose brand was tainted is Donald Trump. I mean, this guy was tainted every kind of way you could imagine. I mean, no way in the world that Donald Trump is a champion of working people.","I'm going to be fighting to rebuild the Democratic party no matter what. I'm going to be fighting to make sure the Democratic party is known among working people that we are their champion no matter what.","Americans deserve journalists who provide responsible, objective reporting.","For Ben Carson, Donald Trump, or any other Republican politician to suggest that someone of any faith is unfit for office is out of touch with who we are as a people.","There's nothing wrong with any group of Americans using our democratic system in order to advance their policy views.","I'll never forget working to get my college, Wayne State University, to divest from the government in South Africa. This was the beginning of my activism, and the fight for social and economic justice has been a constant thread in my life.","My values - going back to my childhood - were always based on respect for all people and rejection of bigotry and racism.","I think debates are healthy. I think they include more people. And I don't believe most people, if they don't win, are just going to take their ball and go home.","I think that whenever businesses harm the economy, harm workers, harm consumers, or undermine human rights in any way, then it is the role of the government to make sure that they don't do that and to make sure that markets are fair and they operate properly.","I am not one of those people who has contempt for Hillary Clinton. I think she's served our nation. I think there are things that she's done that are very good.","I have a deep and personal aversion to anti-Semitism regardless of its source, and I reject and condemn the anti-Semitic statements and actions of the Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan, and Khalid Muhammed.","I think it's dangerous to prosecute people for their political views and their political associations. I think you prosecute people for what they do, for their acts.","We need more leaders speaking up for minority groups who have been marginalized and attacked.","I think there are real dangers to escalating military conflict with ISIS, and we need to be aware of them. But at the same time, you have to understand, you know, that this whole thing started with Bashar al-Assad and how he is the one who continued to escalate against the people of Syria who were trying to get democratic reform.","The idea of a financial transaction tax on Wall Street trades is gaining momentum. I have a bill called - nicknamed the Robin Hood tax also. It's a bill that taxes stock trades, derivatives and bonds, and would generate in the neighborhood of $300 billion a year.","Decent wages keep people out of homeless shelters. Decent wages allow families to afford books and, I don't know, school fees and things like that.","The real problem for Democrats is we've got to help people believe, and then we've got to deliver the message to them. Believe what? That we are absolutely, unshakeably on their side, and we're going to fight for them every single minute.","We got to make sure that the Democratic Party is not just Democratic, but seen to be Democratic. That means we got to have systems in place that makes sure that everybody who participates in a primary is perceived to have an equal shot with everybody else.","We've got to make sure our veteran, Democratic veterans are strengthened and feel like they are fully included.","What is it to be white? It does mean something to be Norwegian. It means something to be Polish or German or Spanish. But 'white' is simply a catchall for 'light-skinned person.' It doesn't really mean anything.","One of the things that will decline over time is the demand that the society or the government bring forth a particularized racial remedy based on a history of deprivation. That will be even more difficult to do in the future.","People like, George Soros, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Paul Krugman, Joe Stiglitz, Jeffrey Sax, Dean Baker, Robert Poland, Larry Summers have said they all support a transaction tax.","The government has a right - the government and the people of the United States have a right to run the programs of the United States. Health, welfare, housing - all these things."],"Keith Emerson":["Find a good teacher, as I found for my sons. I feel the worst thing you can do is to try and teach your own children yourself, because there is a natural rebellion that occurs.","If you're a good parent, see the changes that are happening in your kids.","I consider everything I compose a gift.","I guess when Rick is finished with his Journey to the Centre of the Earth, then we might have a go at something. We'd like to, we're open to it, and we've been talking about it.","You've got to keep things flying.","I was always playing the Hammond Organ back to front even during the days of the Nice, going back to 1968. Really what I was doing there, was choosing notes at random and trying to make some sense of them, improvising back to front.","They were keen for me still to play the piano, which I was going to, but 45 minutes of piano would be extremely boring. I like a bit of light and shade.","I've never written a book before.","There's a clip where he had someone miming me running around from keyboard to keyboard. Oh dear, I am sure a lot of people didn't know what he was going on about.","We'll be presenting a broad spectrum of the music and looking at how the younger guys can carry it on.","The best thing about this band is I'm the leader!","I don't regard myself as a great classical or jazz pianist. I like country music, but I'm not a great player. I just like music. Drums 'n' bass is pretty exciting and I'd love to explore it.","My sons are into German music, but they are into all kinds of music.","I remember that I used to mix with my friends who had brothers and sisters. I was an only child.","I'm proud of my kids, they are doing what they want to do.","I love my mother dearly, but it wouldn't be suitable for me to live with her all the time.","If we didn't do the tour, it would have been disastrous.","I'm not a rich man, and Greg Lake is certainly not. I don't know how he can survive. I don't know how he can be that suicidal. But having said that, I'd love to be there to help Greg.","I had written movie scores, television series, played with other people. Carl had done the same with Asia, with other bands, everything. We weren't about to entrust Greg automatically with a production credit.","We can all put weight on or lose weight.","I've gone through hell and back.","Next year I'm going to be a guesting soloist with orchestras all over Europe, to start off with.","I don't care who I play to, as long as they enjoy listening to what I play.","If they want a photograph, then just take it.","I've broken my nose, I've broken ribs. You name it. In fact, we just got back from South America, and I fell over a monitor speaker on the stage and almost ended up in the front row of the audience. I managed to sprain my wrist on that one but luckily nothing was broken.","Since this our first show, I think they'll see us sweat a lot.","At the Isle of Wight, the sound went out and kind of kept on going. And I wasn't... when I came off stage I was kind of unhappy about how we had played. But now, I listen back to those recordings and it's not bad.","If it wasn't good, I wouldn't be going back out on tour.","We manage to bounce ideas off one another. Every band fights, but at the end of the day, we're very positive about the way we fight. At least we come out with a result."],"Keith Haring":["Red is one of the strongest colors, it's blood, it has a power with the eye. That's why traffic lights are red I guess, and stop signs as well... In fact I use red in all of my paintings.","Art is nothing if you don't reach every segment of the people.","My contribution to the world is my ability to draw. I will draw as much as I can for as many people as I can for as long as I can.","I have been enlightened. I have fallen into poetry and it has swallowed me up.","Art is for everybody.","I don't think art is propaganda; it should be something that liberates the soul, provokes the imagination and encourages people to go further. It celebrates humanity instead of manipulating it.","When it is working, you completely go into another place, you're tapping into things that are totally universal, completely beyond your ego and your own self. That's what it's all about.","Everybody draws when they are little.","Nothing is important... so everything is important.","The public needs art - and it is the responsibility of a 'self-proclaimed artist' to realize that the public needs art, and not to make bourgeois art for a few and ignore the masses.","Drawing is still basically the same as it has been since prehistoric times. It brings together man and the world. It lives through magic.","If commercialization is putting my art on a shirt so that a kid who can't afford a $30,000 painting can buy one, then I'm all for it.","I think you have to control the materials to an extent, but it's important to let the materials have a kind of power for themselves; like the natural power of gravity, if you are painting on a wall, it makes the paint trickle and it drips; there is no reason to fight that.","There are some images that I will only use once, and not use again because they don't seem to really hit the nail right on the head, but there are some which are so strong they have to be reduced; sometimes just reusing them makes them stronger.","When I die there is nobody to take my place.","I grew up in Pennsylvania in a small town. Real small, like one high school and one movie theater. Well, there was a state college there, that was the only good thing about it.","I am intrigued with the shapes people choose as their symbols to create a language. There is within all forms a basic structure, an indication of the entire object with a minimum of lines that becomes a symbol. This is common to all languages, all people, all times.","The dripping... well, if it happens, it happens; it does not take anything from the work. The dripping just proves that you were not trying to control the work, but the work was developing by itself and if it drips, it's a natural part in the evolution of the work.","See, when I paint, it is an experience that, at its best, is transcending reality.","I've always wanted to work for Walt Disney. That's what I thought I was going to do when I grew up.","I didn't start doing graffiti until two years after I got to New York. Jean Michel Basquiat was one of my main inspirations for doing graffiti. For a year I didn't know who Jean Michel was, but I knew his work.","People were more interested in the phenomena than the art itself. This, combined with the growing interest in collecting art as an investment and the resultant boom in the art market, made it a difficult time for a young artist to remain sincere without becoming cynical.","Shapes that contain no inner components of positive/negative relationships will function better with other shapes of the same nature."],"Keith Henson":["Cult recruiting methods based on dosing victims with the brain chemicals released during capture bonding would make cults even more of a problem than they are now.","I suspect that a substantial fraction of human problems in the world today, not just cults, result from the mismatch between the current environment and the environment in which we evolved.","I much prefer the modern world.","Anyone who has ever had the feeling of being higher than a kite after giving a public speech is well aware of the effects of attention.","Could people be trained to be less gullible? Or are you as stuck with gullibility as you are with skin colour?","People can undergo a sudden change of thinking and loyalties under threat of death or intense social pressure and isolation from friends and family.","Primates will continue to play social games without the least insight into what is killing them.","The rare person is still interested in new advances when they are adults. There is possibly a correlation with intelligence. In any case, you have to be fairly bright to keep learning and changing attitudes as you get older.","As for leadership, I am the kind who leads reluctantly and more by example than anything else. Someone had to be on the incorporation papers as president.","I can't think of anyone who is up on evolutionary psychology and related areas who is deluded enough to be called a utopian.","If anyone wonders why the airlines are not doing well it is because flying has been made such an unpleasant and degrading experience.","Attention is the way social primates measure status. It is highly rewarding because it causes the release of brain chemicals such as dopamine and endorphins.","Most of the suicide hijackers came from Saudi Arabia, a place not lacking in wealth. But due to rapid population growth, the wealth per capita has fallen by about half in a generation.","Even small cults are a serious cost on the world economy, to victims, their families, employers, friends, and credit-card companies.","Cults, or related social movements such as the Taliban in Afghanistan, result in massive military expenses.","The information that is passed from person to person and from generation to generation is the primary factor that gives humans a competitive advantage over other animals.","Children do not have to learn that streets are dangerous places by potentially fatal trial and error.","Evolution acts slowly. Our psychological characteristics today are those that promoted reproductive success in the ancestral environment.","Genetic studies in Iceland have found that many of the women who were the founding stock of Iceland came from England and what is now France. Some were probably captured and carried off in Viking raids only 40 generations ago.","Fighting hard to protect yourself and your relatives is good for your genes, but when captured and escape is not possible, giving up short of dying and making the best you can of the new situation is also good for your genes.","High status males had multiple wives or additional mating opportunities in the ancestral environment.","Brigham Young had 47 children, and over 50 women as wives.","Humans have evolved to be exquisitely sensitive to changes in status.","People repeat behaviour that leads to flooding their brains with pleasurable chemicals. The short-term reward loop acts over hours to years, and the long-term reproductive success loop over generations.","Action leads to Attention. that in the short-term releases Rewarding brain chemicals and in the long term improves reproductive success.","Successful cult memes induce intense social interaction behaviour between cult members. This trips the attention detectors.","The drug or cult has major if not exclusive sources of brain rewards.","Some people recovering from drugs or alcohol stay with the programs indefinitely, making the recovery program their family, a long-term source of attention rewards.","Lie detection is like language; there is a learning window. Telling whoppers to small children seems to be a family tradition in many families."],"Keith Hernandez":["I won't say that women belong in the kitchen, but they don't belong in the dugout.","Everyone has someone they looked up to. Mine was Mickey Mantle. For Alex Rodriguez to idolize me coming up, that makes me feel very good.","They can't have Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling lose a game.","The Yankees have better starting pitchers than Arizona. Arizona just has two... the Yanks have four.","I didn't cost the Series. I cost a game in the regular season.","Acting is really not what I'm interested in. I'm not an aspiring actor and you should be able to tell.","You can always improve your bench and relief pitching.","You never know what's going to happen the rest of the way. You can't predict. You don't know what Montreal is going to do to us this weekend, and you don't know what the Cubs are going to do to the Cardinals."],"Keith Jackson":["My grandma once told my mama, 'The kid's walking crazy around the cornfield, talking to himself.' I was calling ballgames.","If I've helped people enjoy the telecast, that's fine. That's my purpose.","Baseball is a game of geometry, while football is a game of explosive emotion. Every emotion known to mankind is in that 60 minutes - pride, pain, dedication, satisfaction, fear.","This 'Whoa, Nellie!' thing is overrated. There were all kinds of stories going around. People said I had a mule in Georgia named Nellie. Well, we had a mule in Georgia, but her name was Pearl.","Amplify, clarify, and punctuate, and let the viewer draw his or her own conclusion.","I don't want to get back into the pressure cooker of play-by-play and worry about travel. I don't want to die in a stadium parking lot.","The one thing you can't ever forget - the playing field is the property of the players and the coaches. It is not to be used by some fat-butted announcer trying to make a name for himself.","It's the broadcaster's dilemma. Are we true journalists? I don't know if I am or not.","The older I got, the more willing I was to go into the Southern vernacular, because some of it's funny.","The best way to get somebody's attention is with a little quiet, and then yell at 'em.","When the money gets bigger and the stakes get higher, the sea gets wider, and the sharks in the water grow sharper teeth.","Michigan has such grandiosity. It has all those all-Americans. You can't go anywhere without finding a Michigan graduate.","Football is not a contact sport, it is said: it is a collision sport. Dancing is a contact sport.","I talk to the guy who busted his butt all week to buy a color TV, and the woman who's raising her kids, the people I owe a debt to. I'm talking to people in hotel rooms, lonesome people.","When you come into Camp Randall Stadium to play a game, you better double-clutch your chinstrap because you're going to be in a smash-mouth game.","I think college football is a reflection of Middle America. You go into a college football town, and you will find three generations of a family sitting together. It's a rallying point for the university, the community, and the families.","If I could get someone like John Grisham or someone like that to sit down and write a book with me, I'd love that.","Bo Schembechler was the best after-dinner speaker I ever heard. He'd even have the old boys in the back of the room snorting and jumping up and down.","You must tell the truth. You must be truthful to yourself and the values of the game that got you there."],"Keith Jarrett":["Music always turns into music. As soon as I play a key, push a key down, there's no theory any more. When I go and I hear a sound on the keyboard, all theories go out the window.","We accept so many things that come through the media; we get used to them, however vigilant we are. But for any creative art, you have to remain 110% conscious, and in a world that's losing consciousness, that's getting harder.","Once we're inside a tune, we can do anything with it.","You know, when people look at a tree, they look at the leaves; they don't look at the spaces between the leaves. They're focused on the tree. I think there's an awareness of spaces or it wouldn't look like a tree to them.","We really never know what we're gonna play when we get on stage.","I grew up with the piano. I learned its language as I learned to speak.","Jazz is there and gone. It happens. You have to be present for it. That simple.","I'm my own most merciless critic onstage.","I cannot say what I think is right about music. I only know the rightness of it.","Musicians are always gigging and never have a chance to stop for a minute.","If you already have a piece of music ingrained in your body, why would you not play it?","When you're up against an electric band like that, it's like you're on two separate planets.","I don't like recording studios - except my own, which is just a little room above the garage.","I'm not talking ideas, or even presentation. It's like in politics: You have to sell something to become an electric player - like your skin or your heart.","I am a romantic, I admit it.","Your own music comes out of your head and emotions, but it's not etched in your system.","I can't even tolerate my own playing on electric keyboards. It's not about the musical ideas - the sound itself is toxic. It's like eating plastic broccoli.","I actually get a metallic taste in my mouth when I think about electric music.","I realized that improvisers should probably always have time off. But musicians are always gigging and never have a chance to stop for a minute - unless something drastic occurs.","One thing you learn: if you want to reveal yourself, you also have to know where to stop.","The way I think about the practicing, it is my undercover work.","When you're on stage you have a very strange knowledge of what the audience is. It isn't exactly a sound - it's a hum, like the streets.","If a person plays dissonance long enough, it will sound like consonance. It's a language that was alien and then it's less and less alien as it continues to live.","If I'm not a jazz player all the time, I've at least been cued in to what I do by jazz."],"Keith Kellogg":["Immigration is important. We're a nation of immigrants.","When I decided to leave the military, I realized that the skills I acquired there were transferable to the commercial world both in leadership and the information technology field. I made the decision to move to Oracle because of its strong leadership role.","We need a very robust way of looking at people coming into the country... We're focused on the whole concept of the ideology and of the vetting.","I've been a paratrooper all my life.","My experience in decision-making has shown that patterns are tough to break. In the military, we study an opponent, looking for gaps, flaws, or weaknesses that can be exploited. Successful leaders at all levels in all disciplines conduct this kind of analysis.","Clinton considers the 2011 overthrow of Moammar Gadhafi in Libya to be one of her finest hours as secretary of state. President Obama considers it one of his worst failures.","In Syria, while secretary of state, Clinton watched as United Nations resolution after U.N. resolution failed. She accomplished nothing except to repeat the refrain, 'Assad must go.'","Egypt has always been critical to the stability of the Middle East pertaining to Israel. We need them with us for continued efforts to maintain peace in the region.","I started my career in the U.S. military. Traditionally, in the military... you either start with a technical background or a more leadership-focused one. I took the leadership path.","The first thing you always do is seek out the best people that you can find for your organization. If you find the best people, you can basically go anywhere you want to go because they will take you there.","Immigration is tough. My daughter-in-law is going through the immigration process as we speak."],"Keith Maitland":["Active-shooter scenarios have become part of the education lexicon. I had fire drills. My parents had duck and cover - nuclear and atomic bomb drills. Kids today grow up with this idea that this could happen at any point in time.","I don't think anyone is pro-school shooting.","I'm just one of those people that when there's a door that says 'Do Not Enter,' I have to know what's happening on the other side of that door.","I love working with rotoscopic animation because under the incredible handpainted artwork are real actors and real human performances.","Two actors that I had particularly fantastic experiences with include Chris Doubek, a notable indie journeyman who also happened to live in the trailer behind my house, and Violett Beane.","Honestly, I don't think that the policies and issues surrounding guns will be easily figured out in our country, but we need to take a close look, and we need to have a conversation around those issues.","I'm a big fan of Robert Altman, and one of the things I love in 'The Long Goodbye' is the way that he plays with the theme; it's just used in all these different ways.","When I went to the University of Texas, my first day of freshman year in 1994, I took a student tour, and I asked about the tower shooting. I was told, 'We're really not supposed to talk about that.' That was the official stance from the university.","I appreciate a subdued performance, typically.","I wanted to create an experiential film that was immersive... I wanted you to feel like you were there.","When you make the decision to call somebody out of the blue and say you want to talk to them about the worst thing that has happened to you, and I'm going to turn it into a cartoon... you're bound to ruffle some feathers or turn people off.","I read Pamela Colloff's oral history about the campus shooting, '96 Minutes,' when it was first published, and my wheels immediately starting turning toward making a film and making it an animated re-telling.","As a documentary filmmaker, I try to be sensitive to my subjects.","When I reach out to people to ask them to be involved in anything I shoot, I want them to want to share their story.","As far as documentaries, 'Man on Wire,' 'Atomic Cafe,' 'Waltz With Bashir,' and 'Thin Blue Line' all offered me different perspectives to consider as we were designing the structure and approach to 'Tower.'","I love SXSW. I've made three films; they've all premiered at SXSW.","My first night in Austin was at SXSW in 1994 when I was a senior in high school. I came here for spring break and just fell in love with Austin. It's my home.","New York is incredible, but I never felt a part of a community.","In Austin, you work in anything that will pay and a lot of things that don't. The documentary filmmaker may also be a gaffer on a feature and producer for a commercial series and web host. Everyone just does a little bit of everything, and you have to because it's a secondary market.","Yes, I realize when I'm reaching out to people and asking them to talk about the most traumatic thing to happen in their lives, I have to be really sensitive and thoughtful.","I've always been intrigued by questions of perception and identity-building, specifically how teens and young adults define themselves within their communities.","In general, I just try to make the people that I'm shooting feel like they are in good hands. I'm open-minded, and I invite them to be open-minded to the process. I'm direct and curious.","The amazing thing about rotoscoping is that it's very malleable. Unlike green screen, where the computer subtracts out the background, rotoscoping is an additive technology in that you don't take anything away from the footage - you add layers on top of it."],"Keith Miller":["I have learned to like myself for the first time and to have some serenity.","Pain is the doorway to wisdom and to truth.","No gentleman ever discusses any relationship with a lady.","We are a nation of people who are afraid we are not enough.","There never was a social change in America without angry people at the heart.","My only hope to receive love is to let you see who I am, then I may believe you.","Beneath all of these addictions is this disease, this control disease which is the mark of our society.","I am six feet tall. I am not supposed to be afraid.","I learned that the purpose of the Twelve Steps is to do the will of God.","If God is in a life, it doesn't have to be big to be happy and to be important in His kingdom.","I wrote a book called The Taste of New Wine because I couldn't find a book that talked about the reality of the situation and how we were dishonest and afraid.","Religious work is one of the best ways to keep from facing your reality if you are Christian, if you are using it to calm the pain, because that it what all addictions are, attempts to cover the pain of this spiritual disease.","I was taught that pain is bad.","I am too old to think.","We live in a constant fear that our shortcomings will be exposed to family, to friends and to the world.","I remember when I was a little boy my father didn't love me; he couldn't. He loved my older brother but he couldn't love me somehow, at least not in a way I could understand it.","I grew up and I became very successful at what I did as a young man. I became a work addict because this was the only way I could get any relief from this pain.","The whole Bible is the story of men and women trying to get back to God, to overcome that sin with sacrifices, good works, sermons, prophesy, witnessing, giving all kinds of things. It never worked.","A lot of us have jobs where we need to give people structure but that is different from controlling.","You are controlling because I want you to do it, not because of the situation or what needs to be done.","We religious controllers control in the name of Jesus and it is really painful to people.","The primary symptom of a controller is denial, that is I can't see its symptoms in myself.","A spiritual person is also in touch with his or her own reality, feelings and thoughts, and the reality of the people around him or her, not projecting on them.","What happens is that people who are very religious but who are not in touch with reality, cannot be spiritual.","We can't be intimate because we can't share feelings that we don't have.","Intimacy, as I am using it, is sharing my reality with you.","Feelings are like a color chart that God has given us.","Then one day I read about a book that said that the church is the only army that shoots its wounded."],"Keith Moon":["I told people I was a drummer before I even had a set, I was a mental drummer.","I was a rust repairer. I was a rust repairer and full-time survivor. I survived all the major earthquakes, and the Titanic, and several air crash.","I love to see people laugh and I love it more if I can make them laugh.","They're always saying I'm a capitalistic pig. I suppose I am. But... it's good for my drumming.","My friends call me Keith, but you can call me John.","At heart I cannot accept that I am a well-known rock 'n' roll star and one of the greatest drummers in the world.","I can't believe that person on the television is really me."],"Keith O'Brien":["In Scotland over many years we have cultivated through our justice system what I hope can be described as a 'culture of compassion.' On the other hand, there still exists in many parts of the U.S., if not nationally, an attitude towards the concept of justice which can only be described as a 'culture of vengeance.'","I know that many of you do wear such a cross of Christ, not in any ostentatious way, not in a way that might harm you at your work or recreation, but a simple indication that you value the role of Jesus Christ in the history of the world, that you are trying to live by Christ's standards in your own daily life.","Redefining marriage will have huge implications for what is taught in our schools, and for wider society. It will redefine society since the institution of marriage is one of the fundamental building blocks of society. The repercussions of enacting same-sex marriage into law will be immense.","My message to David Cameron, as the head of our government, is to seriously think again about this Robin Hood tax, the tax to help the poor by taking a little bit from the rich.","To increase aid to the Pakistan government when religious freedom is not upheld is tantamount to an anti-Christian foreign policy.","If marriage can be redefined so that it no longer means a man and a woman but two men or two women, why stop there? Why not allow three men or a woman and two men to constitute a marriage?","There is no doubt that, as a society, we have become blase about the importance of marriage as a stabilising influence and less inclined to prize it as a worthwhile institution.","Same-sex marriage would eliminate entirely in law the basic idea of a mother and a father for every child. It would create a society which deliberately chooses to deprive a child of either a mother or a father.","No Government has the moral authority to dismantle the universally understood meaning of marriage.","Clearly, if it is sensible to hold a referendum on independence, it is crucial that we have one on marriage. It is the only way the country can move forward on this issue. Let all those who have a view on this subject place their trust in the Scottish people and let Scotland decide.","The church's teaching on marriage is unequivocal, it is uniquely, the union of a man and a woman and it is wrong that governments, politicians or parliaments should seek to alter or destroy that reality.","I hope that increasing numbers of Christians adopt the practice of wearing a cross in a simple and discreet way as a symbol of their beliefs.","There was no pomp and ceremony in connection with the birth of Jesus - rather the opposite: it took place in simplicity and in poverty.","Perhaps more than ever before, there is that aggressive secularism and there are those who would indeed try to destroy our Christian heritage and culture and take God from the public square. Religion must not be taken from the public square.","I've liked women but I've never felt I wanted to give up my life completely. I've never wanted to go to bed with anybody.","I might be celibate, but I appreciate the wonder of the sacrament of marriage.","Whatever flaws or personal failings afflict them, it remains the case that the overwhelming majority of priests and politicians are honourable and honest - seeking to live out their beliefs and serve society.","In Scotland, Catholics have raised their voices against sectarianism and intolerance directed against the Church. Clearly, these actions show that freedom of religious expression, a basic human right, is not upheld in our midst as widely and as completely as it should be.","Our Prime Minister, Gordon Brown has given the Government's support to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill. It is difficult to imagine a single piece of legislation which, more comprehensively, attacks the sanctity and dignity of human life than this particular Bill."],"Keith Olbermann":["Once the Republicans get rolling, they assume they're going to win everything. They are zealots, and zealots assume the last five percent of whatever their plan is will be taken care of by their own greatness or momentum or divinity.","I'm not an anarchist. I believe in government.","Fox News is hated because they're elitists, and the worst winners television's ever seen.","Even on the greatest teams, there's always one role player.","I guess the painkillers wipe out your memory along with your ethics.","Reagan's dead, and he was a lousy President.","At Current, television is all we do - that's our business. We don't have amusement parks I have to worry about, we don't have environmental cases against us, we don't have a series of outdoor-advertising companies.","It's not about 'NBC is evil.' It's about that media structure - CBS, ABC, CNN, even some of the smaller operations are now multinationals, with these extraordinarily diverse holdings.","The corporation is one of the great unheralded human inventions of destruction. It is a way to absolve from any personal liability a bunch of people. They form together in a massive ID and they do whatever they want.","All the things that people like me supposedly don't do, I do.","I can't think of an instance at MSNBC where anything I said on the air was influenced by what was going on behind the scenes.","Our country is wounded and bleeding now if we don't know whether or not habeas corpus exists.","I have achieved what I wanted to achieve. I'm better off at some sort of independent place where they not only like what I produce but also trust me to be the one to produce it.","I'm a natural management guy. I had forgotten that. And I forgot how much I hate it.","As part of the process by which you hire me, you hire me. You just don't hire an hour of me to do a performance.","I stand up to people.","I'm difficult for management. That's why I have the reputation because nobody challenges management."],"Keith Richards":["You have the sun, you have the moon, you have the air that you breathe - and you have the Rolling Stones!","If you don't know the blues... there's no point in picking up the guitar and playing rock and roll or any other form of popular music.","Good music comes out of people playing together, knowing what they want to do and going for it. You have to sweat over it and bug it to death. You can't do it by pushing buttons and watching a TV screen.","You've got the sun, you've got the moon, and you've got the Rolling Stones.","Everyone talks about rock these days; the problem is they forget about the roll.","It's great to be here. It's great to be anywhere.","About myself I have no great illusions. I know what I am. I know what I'm good at. I know what I ain't. I'm always hoping to surprise myself. But I do have a love of music and I do love to communicate it, and that's the best I can do, really. And I can raise a good family, too.","I've never had a problem with drugs. I've had problems with the police.","Songwriting's a weird game.","If you're going to kick authority in the teeth, you might as well use both feet.","I've never had my hair cut by anybody, I do it all myself.","I look for ambiguity when I'm writing because life is ambiguous.","Yes, I've been trepanned. That's quite an interesting experience, especially for my brain surgeon, who saw my thoughts flying around in my brain.","Songwriting's a weird game. I never intended to become one - I fell into this by mistake, and I can't get out of it. It fascinates me. I like to point out the rawer points of life.","I mean some doctor told me I had six months to live and I went to their funeral.","Rock and Roll: Music for the neck downwards.","Everybody's got a different way of telling a story - and has different stories to tell.","Give me a guitar, give me a piano, give me a broom and string; I wouldn't get bored anywhere.","And it was a very, very fruitful and great relationship between the Stones and The Beatles. It was very, very friendly.","To me, my biggest fear is getting a big head, and that is when I get the hammer. Because it's very easy in this game to believe you're something special.","To me, as long as we've known each other, I've always thought Mick's most brilliant thing was that he could work in an area two foot square and give a very exciting performance.","To make a rock'n'roll record, technology is the least important thing.","It's an addiction... and addiction is something I should know something about.","It's good to be anywhere.","If you say I'm great, thank you very much. But I know what I am. I could be better, man, you know?","When you're supported by millions all over the world, you can either go nuts, or try to feed off the goodwill.","I never thought I was wasted, but I probably was.","Hey, we just enjoy it. I think we think we're getting the hang of this thing, you know?","I achieved everything I wanted to achieve by being in the Rolling Stones and making records.","The Beatles were basically a vocal band.","Another thing to do with the blues is how they were recorded. They were done on the quick, and some of that stuff was made on wire, not even tape, let alone digital.","You didn't know whether Chuck Berry was black or white - it was not a concern.","I have no idea what the audience makes of me.","I've always been suspicious of TV, I've always found music and video to be an unhappy marriage.","Let me be clear about this. I don't have a drug problem. I have a police problem.","The only things Mick and I disagree about is the band, the music and what we do.","The Stones in a club is still the ultimate rush.","There's no substitute for live work to keep a band together.","When I listen to what I did under the influence - 10 years of work - I don't think it either enhanced or impaired me. It didn't have that much to do with it.","I only get ill when I give up drugs.","You don't start to play your guitar thinking you're going to be running an organisation that will maybe generate millions.","I don't trust doctors. It's not to say there ain't some good ones, but on a general level, no, I wouldn't trust 'em at all.","You get onstage and make other people feel happy. Make them feel good.","I mean, give me a guitar, give me a piano, give me a broom and string, I wouldn't get bored anywhere.","This is the rock 'n' roll life, and you had to invent it as you went along. There was no textbook to say how you operate this machinery.","You know, the BBC had not been particularly generous in its deliverance of blues and esoteric kinds of music.","I've never tried to achieve anything. I achieved everything I wanted to achieve by being in the Rolling Stones and making records."],"Keith Rothfus":["I've been on Wall Street once in my life in 1980 as a tourist. I went to see the stock exchange when I was 18 years old. I'm not a Wall Street lawyer, I'm a Stanwix Street lawyer. Stanwix Street is a street in downtown Pittsburgh.","By no stretch of the imagination can you describe me as a Wall Street lawyer. If you're going to do that, you'd have to say that 7,500 people who work here in Southwestern Pennsylvania for the Bank of New York Mellon with good family jobs are Wall Streeters.","I'm looking for leaders who are going to go to Washington for a season, not career politicians. People who understand that the strength of America comes from the private sector, not Washington, D.C.","I talk about the three R's, that jobs equals three R's: Repeal Obamacare. Reform our tax-and-spend policies to make us the most competitive in the world. And relight America with American energy.","I have a reputation in my professional work, negotiating contracts, where I've gone into deals where other people haven't closed the deal, and I've been able to get it done.","I went to see the stock exchange when I was 18 years old. I'm not a Wall Street lawyer, I'm a Stanwix Street lawyer. Stanwix Street is a street in downtown Pittsburgh. One of the clients is Mellon Bank, which merged with the Bank of New York Mellon a number of years ago. And I have for years have done software licensing for Mellon.","I'm a transactional lawyer; I negotiate all types of things, but with a particular focus in software licenses."],"Keith Stanfield":["Some people look like they're lost causes, but they're not. Even if they're in a messed up situation, the one little thing you do to help can go a long way.","My biggest strength is I'm courageous, or if I am afraid of something, I do it anyway. I do what I feel. It's nothing personal against anyone, so that courageousness has been very good to me.","That was like my safe place with great teachers where everyone could let down their guard and not feel judged. As soon as we walk outside, it was like, 'Look at these weird drama club kids.' But we all had our own agreement that we were cool in our own way.","You can be the most intelligent person, and you can have so much potential, but if you don't have a guide by which to channel that energy, then a lot of times, it's futile.","I grew up very poor in a fractured family that was dysfunctional on both sides, but I sort of put up these reflectors to most of the negative things that have occurred in my life. I don't carry around much baggage.","My two little twin brothers have autism, so I grew up around it and misunderstood it for a long time.","I'm from Victorville - it's about an hour-and-a-half away from Los Angeles, up in the desert. They call it Victimville because it's kind of violent. It's a beautiful place, though. It's quiet.","I was kind of a weird kid in high school. I didn't have many friends in my age group because all they wanted to do was fight and have riots.","I'm in this music duo called Moors.","When you're talking about an authority figure oppressing against people, it's the people that hold that authority figure up. If you want to get free of this bondage, then we need to think about ways to free ourselves rather than looking to the oppressors to free us.","It's been constant grinding and trying to secure work that I care about, tireless auditions and meetings. I've been fortunate that a lot of cool doors have opened to me, chiefly meeting great people who were inspired by what I've done and what they feel I could bring to their projects.","It's a hard thing when you've got guns pointed at you, to still stand up for what you believe in. Jimmie Lee and his family did that, and several others.","I think prejudice has gotten to a point where a lot of people hold biases in their mind and don't even realize that they're doing it, because it's deeply ingrained in the fabric of what it means to be an American.","The prison industrial system, things like that are cleverly put in place to attempt to marginalize a certain group of people - and it's not only black, it's replete across the American society.","I was born in San Bernardino in summer of '91 and grew up in Riverside, San Bernardino, and Victorville.","Have you ever heard of 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?' I would like to play Sidney Poitier's role - I love that role.","We used to do sock puppet shows for my auntie back in the day. Me and my friends would do accents of Englishmen, and we would sip tea and act like we were rich in front of the family, and they thought it was just hilarious, the level of perception that we had about things that we'd never experienced.","I feel like with every performance that I see, I get better because I've always thought - while I'm watching people perform - of what I would do.","I'm influenced a lot by my family. I have a big family.","I've always been super expressive, and I've always liked to express myself any way I can.","I've been fortunate to get involved with 'Short Term 12.' I was just a young teenager on the Internet, clicking on anything that had the word 'actor' in it. One day, someone called me in for a movie audition.","Music is something I do full-time in real life. I was doing music long before I was even thinking about acting.","I wanted to be as genuine as possible because all those people like Jimmie Lee Jackson - me, Mike Brown, all these people - we're all the same; we're not much different.","I always knew I'd be an actor. I always knew I'd at least be on a big screen somewhere.","When I was little, when I was a toddler or something, I would watch 'Jason's Lyrica' lot.","For me, life is like an act within itself. Everything I do is an act. Where I'm going is an act.","I really like watching myself a lot because it gives me an opportunity to see it from outside the flesh, and when I view it like that, I can be a lot more cynical and see the things that need to be attacked.","I write poetry, and I put it to a beat - I mean, that's what they call rap.","Victorville gave me opportunity to go inside and explore my imagination a bit.","My focus is anything that allows me to express myself. Rap, dance, photography. Those are my forms of expression.","My producer, HH, makes sounds, so I'm writing to his beats.","They say every five years the atoms in your body become a new set of atoms.","I'm a little baby in a barrel just taking everything in. I'm just so fortunate to do whatever I'm doing.","I want to be in some Willy Wonka-type weird stuff, a role where I'm an alien. Anything that's new and challenging and real. I like real stuff.","Just listening and going back and forth and exchanging ideas with people. It's a beautiful thing. This is what's really important.","Although rap is about boasting, it's also about honesty and expressing your emotions.","I love 'Watch the Throne,' because Kanye was acting so ratchet.","I've done music since I would sit and make songs on my computer mic when I was 11.","Hip-hop is not all '2 Chainz' - although '2 Chainz' is awesome. How he does that with metaphors, I don't know."],"Keith Sweat":["Don't get caught up in the 'look' thing. Sometimes, we as men and women, the first thing that attracts us to someone is their physical appearance, and that's not always a good thing because what's good on the outside is not always good on the inside.","If you fall, get back up. That's what life is about.","I've never done online dating, but first of all, I have a book out called 'Make It Last Forever: The Do's and The Dont's,' which led me to do the online dating thing. A lot of people respect my relationship songs, so they can pretty much trust me.","You can't stop loving or wanting to love because when its right it's the best thing in the world. When you're in a relationship and its good, even if nothing else in your life is right, you feel like your whole world is complete.","I'm trying to forget how much that cost, but I just had to have them.","Nowadays, everyone has a camera phone, and you have to be careful about being caught out there looking crazy and ending up on the Internet.","Everything I was feeling, all the hurt and the pain and the emotion I was going through, I put into my music.","My strategy has always been to give people just enough of me, then pull back. That way, they'll want more.","I'm living proof you can excel regardless of where you come from.","R&B is never going to be dead, it's just going to evolve.","I treat my career like it just happened yesterday.","Out of all the R&B artists that have come out, I think my name has been used most in hip-hop songs.","I'm syndicated on the radio - my show is called 'The Sweat Hotel.'","I'm not in the clubs; I'm a homebody. I go out when I feel I have to for work or if there's a special function. You might catch me at the grocery store, but you won't see me out and about in Atlanta.","I grew up in Harlem Grant projects, and I didn't have a whole lot then. I've always been good about only getting what I need, not what I want. Just because someone else has something, I don't feel the need to.","The talk-box thing that T-Pain does is something new and different for this generation because they don't know about Zapp or Teddy Riley. I think he's creative and has made the talk-box his own in the hip-hop world, but if these young ones studied their musical history, they'd know that."],"Keith Teare":["As users replace usage of the web with a mobile, app-centric ecosystem, the phone becomes the center of gravity. In this mobile world, Facebook is just one app on the phone.","I feel like 'Just.me' is not successful, but it is not a failure.","Would I advise early-stage companies against taking debt? One hundred percent yes.","I escaped London in 1997 because it was hard to raise capital.","It's very hard to cheaply build anything significant in a multi-platform, mobile world.","Mobile will probably disrupt much of what we know of web 2.0.","Path is a well designed app with a singular purpose. For users who solely want to share with a small group of friends, and share everything with the whole group, it is very effective. And of course, it is wonderfully designed. Just.me isn't better or worse, it's just very different. Just.me is a messaging application, not just a sharing app.","We've patented the idea... of using the address book as a place to declare that you like a brand. By so doing, the brand has now got your permission to send you personal messages - it could be money off offers, coupons, promotions, just information, whatever is appropriate.","Mobile Messaging is rapidly becoming the primary way users engage socially on mobile.","Phones were created as social tools. Smartphones are especially good at being social, integrating text, voice, video and images in an endless number of apps that can serve a user's needs, and all without the need for a web-based social network.","As users flock to Vine, Snapchat and, previously, Instagram, the social platforms are challenged to continue to be the primary provider of these services to the growing army of smartphone users.","The human race is already social, and the smartphone has everything needed to enable them to act on their social needs.","Sponsored stories are not a great way to monetize mobile traffic. The phone is way more of a publishing tool than a reading tool. The attention users pay to the streams on mobile is far less than on the desktop.","The Facebook of 2011, the Twitter of 2011 and the Google of 2011 are all understood to be in need of reinvention for a mobile-centric world with no clear strategy to make revenue.","As Android, iPhone and other mobile platforms grow, we are moving away from the page-based Internet. The new Internet is app centric and often message-centric."],"Keith Thibodeaux":["The first thing I think of when I hear the name of Lucille Ball is a Hollywood legend. I have fond memories of growing up at her house, but she was a different person off the set than she was on the set.","The cast called her Lucy, but everyone else called her Mrs. Ball. She was honest with people. If she liked you, you knew it. If she didn't, you knew it, also.","My talent for playing the drums was a gift from God.","Lucy took care of me on the set, and made sure that none of the crew cussed around me. She also had birthday parties for me and made sure that they were well attended.","In fact, I was one of the few trusted people that Lucy allowed to play with their kids. I spent time at their summer home, rode horses at their ranch, and swam at their beach house. I even spent a Christmas with them at Palm Springs one year.","I would rather have played a character like Opie than Little Ricky.","I liked Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer, and that is the kind of character that I would like to have played. That would have been more in tune with who I really was.","George Reeves was really Superman in my eyes. For him to come on the set and be there was a treat for me.","Dad bought me a toy drum one Christmas, and I eventually destroyed it. I wanted a real drum and he bought me a snare drum. Dad continued to buy me one drum after the other."],"Keith Urban":["You go through life experiences. Each record captures a different turning point in my life.","I think everybody has different priorities in their life. People live their lives differently. People become famous through all sorts of different reasons... some of it through art and some of it through just wanting to be famous. And I think how that all starts tends to reflect how you live your life daily.","I love the beginnings of artists when all they've got is raw talent and nothing else.","The records in the house I really remember were, well, Glen Campbell's 'Wichita Lineman' and 'Galveston.' Even as a kid, I knew these songs were glorious. My dad also had records by Merle Haggard, Charley Pride, Waylon Jennings, and then there was also the Eagles and Don Henley. Anything Texas, which includes Don Henley, was big.","I think there's just so many people in the world that don't feel understood, and when you hear a song and you go, 'Oh, that song understands me,' that's an amazing feeling. I get it when I listen to the radio... That's a beautiful part of music.","I always wish I'd had more mentors, better mentors, wiser mentors, people who were proper professional working musicians to guide me as I was coming up.","I think the industry is oblivious to the fact that most people listen to all kinds of stuff. I personally don't know of anyone who listens to only one genre of music. It's vanity because no one does.","You're always in a different headspace when you make each record, so hopefully they're all different. You just pick up things that you wish you hadn't done on the first one.","I've never wanted to name an album from a song title if I could avoid it because I like it to be a body of work.","Getting on the bus and touring was my life. And when that was not around, I felt myself a bit lost at times, because that was all I had.","I'm a little more comfortable in that role. I love being in the studio.","It can get a little costly if you try and leave it until then to write songs. But you're writing all the time. You're collecting songs. I've had songs that have been collected over a two-year period for my next record.","It's not the case of turning in a bunch of songs and recording the next month. I think you're looking for songs all year long and you're writing all year long.","It's something I've always loved doing. I'm not one of the artists who comes in and just does my bit. I'm there every second of every day. That's my hands-on situation.","My father's record collection was all country. That's how I was exposed to it.","Once we get into the groove, we're kind of like long-distance runners - that adrenalin kicks in for me and I just keep running - and I don't stop!","They're mostly done before we went into the studio, although I do like writing in the studio.","I think it took me a while to convince Nashville that what I do is genuine and my heart's in the right place, and I love country music.","I've always been a pretty private, quiet kind of person and so I haven't had to change my life really at all, I don't think.","I tend to write better when I'm not touring.","At the end of the day, the Grammys are about recognizing genres that are making an impact.","Red carpets are pretty unpredictable. You can go from one person asking you what you're wearing to the next person asking you about the situation in Haiti. It's the extreme juxtaposition, and some of the questions can throw me!","The world is getting so reality-driven these days. It seems to be accelerating exponentially. But it's a dangerous game for a lot of people.","Being with my family is very important to me, and touring is very important to me, too, because it's who I am. It's what I do.","I don't swear much; I've taken those words out of my vocabulary, and having kids, you have to have two sets of language!","Sometimes I just cry at random stuff!","A song like 'Once in a Lifetime' is inspired by my marriage - it's a good, life-changing happening in my life. I think when you find your once-in-a-lifetime love, that's what everybody's looking for.","I make no apologies for being a huge fan of radio songs.","Country seems to be finding a bigger audience. Certainly an audience out of the general country scene is finding me.","There are certain songs that are sacred. People want to hear them just as they are in their head; they don't want you messing around with them. And then there are some other songs, if they've been around a long time in our set list, that I think we can take some creative liberties with."],"Keith Waterhouse":["I turn over a new leaf every day. But the blots show through.","Should not the Society of Indexers be know as Indexers, Society of, The?"],"Keke Palmer":["I think people should have fun. And don't get so down on yourself. Enjoy life and be the best person you can be.","You can do anything as long as you don't stop believing. When it is meant to be, it will be. You just have to follow your heart.","Just do you. Go with the flow and with your life because that's you experiencing life. You being yourself is you doing your purpose, so the more we get out of the mindset of thinking there's a certain way to go about things, the more free we become.","I went to private school for a very long time, and we always wore uniforms. Then in third grade, I switched to a public school, so I was so excited to wear what I wanted on the first day. I remember I chose this orange hoodie with a skirt, and it's so funny when I think about it now because my style really hasn't changed that much.","I want to present a very strong and bold image, but with femininity. I love being sweet and salty all together.","Giving back, doing motivational speeches and stuff like that, that's always made me feel good. If you repeatedly go out there, and you are the change that you want to see, then that's what you are.","Not being happy really is my fear.","Don't depend on a guy for your happiness. You have to live your own life and do your own thing. That's when good things come around - when you do your own thing and you're not worried about a man. It will happen in due time.","I believe your reality is what you make it, what you choose to see, and what you choose to allow yourself to do. There are possibilities all around you - magic all around you - no matter what situation you're in.","I love princesses. And I think Cinderella is very strong. She's a young woman thinking outside of her environment, outside of her current situation, and she is choosing to believe that all is possible for her. And I think that is so admirable.","We're all weirdos, and people want to work so hard to fit into society, but it's like, no matter what you do, you're never going to be what society depicts as what's perfect, because that's not real. The only point that you have to make is that 'I'm being me.'","When I was, like, 5 years old, I used to pray to have light skin because I would always hear how pretty that little light skin girl was, or I would hear I was pretty to be dark skin. It wasn't until I was 13 that I really learned to appreciate my skin color and know that I was beautiful.","You're going to have to speak up for yourself - and I learned that after always being, for lack of a better word, crapped on.","When I was a kid, people people would always say, 'Oh you look like Chilli from TLC.' It wasn't until I did 'Akeelah and the Bee' that people started saying I looked like Angela Bassett, but before then it was Chilli.","You have to understand that when things go wrong in your life, it doesn't mean you need to quit. It means you need to get stronger and change your plan.","Even though I'm in the industry and I act and all this stuff, I still suffer from self-esteem issues... from the way that I look or the way that I talk... just nitpicking at myself.","Singing was my first passion. Whenever I sing, I'm always so happy.","Anything that controls my state of mind I never really want to do because I always want to be under control. That might be part of me being a Virgo. I never want to do something that stops me from being in control of who I am and my actions.","Whatever my situation is, I want to show that I'm not perfect, and perfect isn't real. The youth need to know that, especially.","Follow your heart's truth with no need for personal gain other than the feeling produced when doing what you truly love.","I'm a workaholic, so I ignore the signs of fatigue and just keep going and going, and then conk out when I get home. It can be pretty stressful.","My father's a deacon, my mother's a choir director, so I grew up in the church and singing in the choir, begging my mom if I could have a solo.","I would like to do a music person's story, a bio. I've wanted to do Aaliyah forever. But I don't want it to always be like, 'I'm singing again in a movie.'","I'm happy with who I am inside. I'd hate to have accolades and all that and not really be happy with who I was. So I'm really thankful for my family and for the support system that I have for being the person that I am today. I'm proud of who I am.","I have a particular pair of boyfriend jeans that I wear with Converse sneakers and, really, any kind of top, from a crop top to a hoodie. I usually go for a loose top or jacket to keep things casual with sort of a streetwear vibe.","I love my bubble skirt. I wear it with a belt and my shirt tucked in. Just like a t-shirt from Nordstrom's or something. And I wear this navy blue blazer with the sleeves crushed up. And I just feel like I'm such a cool girl when I walk out. I feel like, 'Yeah I'm cool, like a model.'","I feel like you have to tell people who you are, but you don't have to be disrespectful about it. But you also don't have to be a shrinking violet.","If you focus more on the inside, you'll feel just as great about the outside. I feel attractive when I'm doing good and helping people.","I was bullied a lot as a kid in school from kindergarten up to third grade. I know what it feels like to be left out and to want to be different - more so, to want to not be different and want to just fit in.","Broadway was life-changing because it pushes you mentally, physically, emotionally - every way that you can be pushed. It makes you feel like there's nothing you can't do. It's like doing your own stunts.","The type of movies that give me the heebie jeebies are thrillers, because anything that's playing with your thoughts and mind, that's scary. But one thing that they never do in horror movies that I always do is I pray. You never see them pray in horror movies.","Whether it be in acting, music, or even in dancing, I only want to do things that I truly connect to, and with my music, it's everything that I am.","I'm a mash-up of everyone. My influences would be Michael Jackson, Brandy, Aaliyah - those types of people. So if you can imagine them - and with me taking them, and then putting my own twist and the influence on it - that's musically what I would sound like.","Just as many people that love me, hate me, too. I get really mean, mean, mean, mean comments on Twitter, and it just comes with the territory.","I don't wish for anything. Wishing for a million dollars feels greedy. I just wish for the best for me.","I have a few celebrity friends, but I'm really not into the whole Hollywood scene. I like to separate myself from my work. It stresses me out if I do too much of the same.","I can't work all day and then go home and hang out with the same people. I don't want everything to revolve around the entertainment business. Yes, that's my career, but it's not my life.","The music industry is something that I'm still trying to understand. With acting, I've been doing it for so long that I understand every aspect of it for the most part - there are obviously still more aspects that I need to learn - but I have a grasp on it. With music, I'm still learning. I'm still getting used to it.","I'm totally normal. I love watching movies and hanging out with my friends at my house. I still go to the mall; I love to text and go on my computer. I'm totally normal - sounds kind of boring, right?","I never try to be too sexy. People know when you're not comfortable and trying to be sexy.","I don't curl my hair. In fact, I don't know how to.","Urban Outfitters - I love it. It's almost like Forever 21, but for, like, the 24- to 25-year-old girl, getting a little bit older.","Some of my favorite style icons are Kate Moss and Rihanna, except I'm a little bit younger. I put a little bit more teenage into it.","People that want to be in the tabloids will get into the tabloids. I just stay home and don't go out much. My personality is not an introvert, but that's how I am as far as going out to parties. I just stay in my house and hang out with friends.","There's not always going to be something out there for you, especially not a positive role, so once you get up there and start being well known, you can't just think projects will come to you. You have to start doing your own projects because if you don't, you'll miss out, and eventually your fame will be over.","I love singing and I love performing and just making things perfect.","As you age, you start to realize that your emotions are in your hands and not someone else's. Once you put them in someone else's hands, that's when you give them the power, and you can't change it. Only they can change it.","I really look up to Will Smith. He's internationally known, and people know him from everything. I don't know any kid who hasn't seen and liked Fresh Prince, or you'll like one of his movies or his music. He's perfect, and he's done everything. That's my dream: to be internationally known.","Someday I would really love to do a talk show. That's something I've always been interested in. I like to talk, and I love to help people.","I love being in the studio. Expressing myself that way is really cool.","I work out. I'm getting toned, too. The Wii Fit really works your body. When I get off, I'm dying.","I can dance. I like hip hop and stuff and jazz movements, but I'm horrible in ballet. I tried.","Working with Ice Cube was so tight. He's cool, and I really like how he does family stuff. My guy friends couldn't believe I was chillin' with him. Dudes love Ice Cube.","I love competing. I love a challenge. I love going in and showing people what I can do, proving to them that I can get this part, that I can give you what you want.","Comedians like to see people smile. With acting, I love giving people a feeling, an emotion. I like to give people a feeling. When they come away from my scene, I want them to think.","My parents are my role models. All they've done for me, they're just major people in my life. They've stood by me and got me where I am today.","Anytime you see Beyonce, Jay Z, Kanye West. Anytime a young black person's doing good, that's motivation for everybody else. Anytime, anytime, it's motivation. Use that fuel to push you forward. That's what I did.","When people think of me initially, they remember me as 'Akeelah.' Sometimes it can be frustrating to be remembered at an age that you've outgrown.","I love clothes! I shop everywhere, but I like Urban Outfitters, Forever 21, Nordstrom, and Neiman Marcus. It's a wide range. I'm from California, and I love the Pasadena Flea Market.","I definitely want to play someone who's inspired me. I would love to play Aaliyah; it would be personal because I love her so much.","I didn't come from a lot. I had a lot of love and support from my family, but as far as money and that type of thing, I didn't really have any of that. All I did was follow my dreams. If my fans take anything from me, I hope it would be that.","I can't even tell anyone how it feels when I'm acting, I don't mean to say that I don't have to try. But there's something in my heart that explodes, and I feel like I understand. When I'm acting, I feel like so in control and so centered. This is something that I solely get from acting and music. It's like love itself.","Corbin Bleu was my first kiss in life. I was 12, and he was, like, my first kiss for TV... It was on the lips!","I've been able to stay good because of my family and keeping God first. If you don't have God in your life, how are you going to navigate through this world?","I love music and I love acting. I always keep that in the forefront, not all the other distractions around me.","We need to stop separating ourselves by how dark or how light we are.","Real faith is when you believe in something that you can't see. When things are going really bad and you can still get up and say I believe that they're gonna get better, that there's a higher lesson to what I'm going through. It can be hard sometimes, and to turn it around like that, that's true faith.","I'm not a huge musical fan. It's like when people just jump out singing; it's not real.","I always try to set a positive example for my generation and promote confidence.","I think you can do anything you put your mind to. I think your mind is the worst thing you can use as a reason to not do something.","I've never really had a first date! Well, I had kind of a first date. I went out with this kid. We went ice skating, but it was not fun. It was so terrible that I told him my curfew was a lot earlier than it really was.","You should never look at somebody and say, 'I wish I had their life,' because you never really know what struggles they're going through.","I sometimes want to do totally different roles. I don't always want to play 'wholesome.'","Actually, Keke is my nickname. When I was little, my sister was about four years old, and she had an imaginary friend named Keke. And she wanted my name to be Keke.","As a child actor, you experience a lot of depression and anxiety... Yes, I went through depression, and it was not comfortable. Yes, I struggle with anxiety and being paranoid, trying to figure out who I am.","I don't feel the need to define nothin' to nobody, because I'm always changing. Why say that I'm this or that when I might not be tomorrow? I'm gonna follow my own feelings and my own heart.","I've been keeping journals since I was 13.","I grew up loving horror films. But I had to step away since I didn't want all that negative stuff in my psyche. I didn't want to conceptualize those thoughts into my life.","I don't belong to anyone else but myself. I have to make my own decisions. Happiness is defined by me.","I'm very happy to be part of a generation where you don't have to say that you're gay. It's just like, 'I'm dating a dude,' or, 'I'm dating a girl,' and I love it. I think it's a great time.","I feel like I've been known for having long black hair, so when I took all my extensions out and cut my own hair, it was the most freeing thing, I think, I've ever done. That was my 21st year: I cut my hair, I was doing Broadway; I was living in New York, and I was really having a moment of becoming my individual self, and it was amazing.","When I think about people like Queen Latifah, who literally found a script for me to star in, that's what I want to be for somebody. When you look at someone like Queen Latifah, or you think about the Will Smiths, those people are multifaceted. They do so many different things, but most important, they give back.","Growing up in the industry, sometimes you can feel as if you're not having a normal childhood, but I feel like my parents involved me with a lot of people who made things as 'okay' as they possibly could.","I'm usually the one who creates most of my work. I have a lot of different ideas that I want to do, so I'm always like, 'Get on it, girl.'","I think I was always joyous, but I don't think I became very aware of positivity and its power until I became older. I always did it naturally, but then I lost it, and it forced me to find it again and appreciate it more.","I'm definitely a perfectionist. I started entertaining so young. I think, naturally, my personality is that of a perfectionist, and then on top of that, growing up in the industry, I became very objective and analytical of myself early on, and I find myself doing that in everything.","I decided to not be so dismissive of my music in favor of my acting. Acting has been such a consistent thing for me; a lot of times in the past, I wouldn't have had the confidence with my music to really make it a part of my schedule. I would easily push it to the side, or I would easily take up time that was needed for it.","I grew up in Chicago, but when I was 12, I came to New York because I was doing an episode of 'Law & Order.'","I'm a little bit sillier than past Cinderellas... at least, I am so far. But it's only the second day into rehearsal!","I love watching YouTube makeup tutorials of girls who are so brave and show others how to blend in foundation on blemish-prone skin. I've considered creating my own YouTube tutorial for other girls just to show that everyone has these problems.","I love being brown, so I love using Guerlain Terracotta Bronzing Powder. I use it everywhere: my forehead, my cheekbones, a little bit by my chin. It gives me a golden balance that I really like. I also use the Becca Shimmering Skin Perfector for my highlighter right underneath my eye. It's a pretty color - it's not too much and not too little.","I mix my lipsticks a lot. Depending on how I decide to do my eyes, I'll decide to do my lips. I've never really loved wearing only red or purple, and sometimes just pink isn't enough.","My work is my life. I've worked so much that I don't know the difference between my personal life and my work, or my personal friends and my work friends.","I've done a lot of meditation studying on my own, but I've also taken a couple of transcendence classes.","Staying stagnant is not okay.","Queen Latifah has been a huge part of my career. She has been a huge, huge part of my career since the very beginning.","I went to, you know, a church in Chicago, and my mom, of course, was in the choir because my mom was a singer; she used to sing. I wanted to be in the choir as well, and I was like, 'Mom, please, you know, I want to sing in the choir with you guys.' I kept on asking her, and finally I was, you know, in the choir.","I didn't know I was gonna act. I thought I was gonna be a singer because that's what I did first, and I was like, 'When I grow up, I want to be, you know, a singer.'","There've been times where, like when I auditioned for 'Akeelah,' I think in the first audition I was a little bit afraid because it was, you know, I had seen girls in there that I had seen on TV before, and I was like, 'Man, I might as well just walk out of here now because I'm just a newcomer,' and this and that.","I named my album 'So Uncool' because it defies the ordinary: you're different from everyone else. It's like, being uncool makes you cool because you're different!","Team playing, that's what I see when I'm out there watching the WNBA games. All the girls play as a team, and they have each other's backs, and that's great.","I love a lot of these older actresses, like Cicely Tyson, who played Kunta Kinte's mother in 'Roots.' She was really great, and I like seeing her because every movie she plays, she plays a strong character. As a kid, she was really inspiring to me.","You can often tell the difference between a singer that grows up in the church and one that just can sing. There's a connection to love and support and care. You feel good when you hear it. You feel the people have so much conviction in what they're singing. They believe it, so you believe it.","It's hard being a Broadway actor going into film where you have to tone everything down. In theater, everything you're taught is to be big and broad and make everyone feel like they are right next to you, even in the last row of seats.","I'm working on a movie called 'Virgin Mary' with Abigail Breslin. I'm also in 'Ice Age 4: Continental Drift.' And I have a television movie coming on Nickelodeon that I worked on with Nick Cannon. I acted in it, but I am more excited about being a producer!","I wasn't that into it or that knowledgeable of fashion until I started working on 'True Jackson.' I feel like it was my duty to learn more because people would feel that I should because I'm on the show. So definitely, that made me more involved with fashion, and now I'm a little fashion guru. It's totally out of control.","I'm an actor. I have to play weird characters, quirky characters, strange characters, sometimes characters I don't understand.","My real name is Lauren.","I like the medium boys. Not real perfect, but not too bad, either.","I love Instagram! I like LaLa Anthony and Rihanna's photos. They always have great photos."],"Kel Mitchell":["After that I got an agent and went on like a million auditions. You win some, you lose some.","After that, I started going downtown and doing a lot of theater shows in Chicago. When you go downtown there, it's like you're in New York, it's like going to Broadway.","Being a role model, you just got to watch what you do.","Every movie I do, or when I'm on the sketch comedy show, I don't really get into it until I have an outfit or something funny with my head or face or something.","He felt like the invisible boy. When he got to be part of the mystery Men he felt like he had a purpose.","I did a lot of theater in the South side of Chicago.","I loved Spider-Man, Spider-Man was the man.","I passed up a lot of work 'cause a lot of movies that may be out there right now I passed em up because there may have been a lot of cussin' in 'em.","I was a drama major also so it's cool to cuss for meaning, but for no apparent reason, no.","I was always the class clown.","I was the Pink Pansy or whatever, wearing this crazy thing.","I'm doing music, and we both want to do some drama.","If it wasn't for my drama teacher, I wouldn't be here right now.","Invisible Boy was fun. Everybody else's character, they knew where they were at already as a superhero. But invisible boy's character, you kind of grow up with him within the movie.","Mystery Men you can take grandma, you can take everyone to see this film.","We didn't know anything about comedy duos - Abbot and Costello, Martin and Lewis - we didn't know anything about that. Kim Fields showed us a tape of Martin and Lewis and their old shows and they come through the curtain so we started doing research on them.","Where I'm from, they'll beat your head until it gets back down to normal size.","You could do a scene that takes 15 hours, but in the movie, it's only 10 minutes. The scene where they put the sauce poisoning in; it took eight hours."],"Kelela":["Fog and one blue light is all I need in life at the club. Just a dark room and loud music. I'm into that.","When I started making songs, some of them read as mixtape-y, and some of them read as album-y.","A lot of people of color in the music industry are still more interested in embracing things that are considered white canon, and looking radical. Like when people point to punk in the indie world: If you point to the history of punk as what you see as your legacy, that's more prized and praised.","Something that I think extends to a lot of African cultures is that the line between performer and audience is blurry. My mom would lead the wedding song regularly, and she isn't a professional singer. Even as an audience member, you're expected to clap and sing the response to the lead.","It's such a challenging time, and in my small way, I will make it so that other younger women, and maybe older women, will be able to do the things they want to do, and accept themselves and their experience.","My queer black women peers are the ones who make me not feel crazy. The way we act is so instinctive.","'Seat at the Table' has expressed real adversity, struggle, and also triumph and joy.","When I was little, my parents would have these gatherings, and it was a common thing for me and my cousins to have to put on, like, shows.","When I was growing up... I'm not going to say I listened to everything, but when it comes to vocals, I was really adamant about imitating all kinds of voices.","I know deep down I'm a star.","I'm interested in bridging and filling in space that hasn't already been filled, so when it comes to making music, I've just always wanted to be able to reference things that producers in the big pop major label context do, without compromising the entire sound of the record.","There's definitely a push and a pull to 'legitimize' electronic music live by playing the same way that a band would play.","I don't want you to feel defeated, like, 'Oh boy, why do you do this to me?' We have too many of those songs.","I've always had this commitment to not being in one thing.","To me, the best writing points to something literal or common but is also nuanced: The moment when somebody is telling you they love you while simultaneously disappointing you. Everybody's experienced that.","I don't write lyrics. I hear the track and sing in gibberish over it, then I try and fit words into the phrasing and melody that I already have set. Everything is left to chance.","I've grown up feeling very American but being constantly bothered by people - there's internalized racism and feeling weird about being second-generation.","Popular music was this abstraction - an abstraction that I was relating to immensely but was ultimately far away.","I am not carefree. I'm just not. I experience an immense amount of joy, a crazy amount of joy through sadness and so much struggle. There's something problematic about 'carefree black girl.'","I'm just trying to soundtrack your real life. I'm just trying to give you a place to feel safe in all the parts of your experience.","Anyone who understands anti-racist work, a white person specifically, understands that it is not black people's responsibility, or any person of color's responsibility, to dismantle the structures that keep white people in positions of power. We do our job to thrive, to survive. To protect ourselves, to sit together and feel better and to heal.","I'm just tryna be honest about all the things that I dig in my music. It's not just this over here, it's also that over there.","It's been hard for me to nail visual language and personal style because I like so many different things.","As it pertains to my black womanhood, there's just a lot of ground to cover. There's a lot of stuff to say.","I like to try out different methods to get to good songs.","When I called 'Cut 4 Me' a mixtape, I was thinking about a few elements: One is used instrumentals. The project is more centered around introducing you to an artist; it's not meant to be seminal. It's 'Hi,' 'Hello,' a thing that you first hear.","I would say Tracy Chapman was the first time I obsessed over an entire record. I knew every song; I knew the exact amount of seconds between each song. That's the level of obsession that I had.","I really do like Solange, sincerely. I'm down for her, and I trust her judgment.","I spent a lot of time in college. I was just being academic and discovering myself through reason and analysis.","I would love to do an album of standards!","I am your homegirl, at the end of the day, but I also feel very... outside. So if you're finding solace in feeling outside with me, then we're good to go.","Most of my friends, growing up, were upper-middle-class white kids, so it was a different reality at home both culturally and linguistically. It created a lot of insecurities for me, but it also did a lot of amazing things that I didn't know were happening at the time.","I was in school studying International Studies and Sociology. I was really into what was going on in school. I was affected by the ideas and engaged as a student, but not disciplined or motivated enough to do the work. That was a fear of mine for a while, that nothing was motivating.","I like smart rappers who aren't necessarily trying to be deeper than you, like Danny Brown.","Growing up, Missy Elliot and Janet Jackson were definitely major references.","After it became clear that I was not going to graduate, I had this moment where I was like, 'I need to not sulk. I need to pursue - at least try - to pursue music. But if I don't try, I'm going to be a really bitter middle-aged lady working in a cubicle.'","A black woman's handbook in this industry is, 'Whoa.' The chapter on 'Don't go there.' The chapter on 'How to say that nicely,' how to express that you don't like something so that you don't lose the opportunity - which is what we're doing all day long.","I'm pushing back against the white, misogynistic, heterosexual establishment in the music industry. Like, literally, in all its forms.","I just want to shed light, illuminate and turn the spotlight over to all of the black people who have been being futuristic and innovative since instruments were plugged into a wall. With computers, machines, and music, black people have been contributing to that a great deal for a long time.","There is this feeling among black artists that you have to be really careful. We're not inclined to talk about this stuff because, if we do, we put ourselves in a position where we're not marketable or where we can't win.","A lot of white men in the music industry are promoting and participating in black culture in a way that is pretty careless. They want the currency of blackness, but they don't want the brunt that comes along with that.","I just want to live in a world where I can tell a guy, 'This is the deal: I really want this. I really want you. But it's also not that deep.'","I think the Internet is more layered and complex than just hating it or liking it. I find it to be more purposeful to talk about the way that it's conducive for relationships and making connections.","Sometimes I learn by someone giving me warnings and giving me advice about what to do next. And other times, a lot of times, I have to put my hand into the fire.","I think my worst enemy was myself. It's like I've been in my own way more than anybody else has been.","The goal is to blow the audience's mind.","My music sounds like one synergised thing, one message.","As a black woman, there's so much pride and communication through hair. It's naturally something that you are excited to embellish on and be creative about.","I think I'm taking risks and putting myself out there.","I've talked about that with friends, about what genre makes sense to choose for each record and the strategy around that... Sometimes it's more about the moment of time, and other times it's more about the sound of the song. Sometimes it's about what's going on in larger life, in politics.","We are - as artists, we are racialized through genre and called black - without being called black - through genre.","I guess the bottom line is I don't make music that is consumed en masse.","The assumption is simply that I hit on all the things I've hit on so far by accident, that my talent is just this raw thing that pours out of me, and then white people feel like they have to come in and contain it, refine it, and bring it to the place where it can been released.","My first reaction to being pigeonholed or pushed into certain confines is to be like, 'No, I'm the opposite,' you know? Like, don't put me in a stereotypical black-girl category, because I'm not like that; I'm doing this thing over here.","I'm finding out what part of punk culture or white indie culture I actually still want to hold onto - What are the values? What are the contributions that I actually like? - and it not coming from a place of desperation or wanting to be embraced or wanting approval, essentially.","In the music industry, you can't create success without having to engage a white man. It's just not possible. Whether it's executives, A&Rs, and the people that hold the key to your paper, inevitably, you'll be met with whiteness.","You can never have enough reinforcements, resources for black women to thrive in the world. The topic has been addressed a million times before, but it will never end because what we're up against keeps morphing, and we have to figure out how to beat it.","I want to empower.","The act of me just being robust in the world is so radical - it's so radical for a black woman to think she's going to be a star, because it takes so much to get there. It's still a battle every day, but I feel happy because I feel like I cracked the code and figured out how to work through it. Now I want to give the map to other women.","'Take Me Apart' doesn't feel cohesive in a singular way but in a varied way. You can fixate on individual songs, and there are references from all over the place: Anita Baker to Bjork. I wanted to show all the facets of myself.","There are no black women geniuses that are being named in canons. I could name a bunch, but it's not part of common knowledge. It's not how the world is taught to think about black women.","I do like things the way that I like them. But I'm trying not to be - I don't wanna be that way. I'm not a control freak; I wanna protect my agency. It's a weird question as a black woman.","As a black person on the outside, because there's so much black art and so much of black people's work circulating, so many people imitating what black people do, you would think that there'd be more black people on the business side. It didn't cross my mind that every label head, for the most part, is a white guy.","It definitely feels different to perform to people who know your music. Because people's feedback is not just, 'Oh my God, that was amazing. Who are you?'","I have something stupid, like, 12 credits, to graduate.","As much as we like to pretend we're just getting on stage and whatever, it's like, no, I practiced in front of the mirror my whole life.","Often, I write to feel better and to heal - to cope with things that I'm dealing with. I'm either writing to get out of a feeling or to get into the feeling, to feel it more. Usually it's the perfect remedy, but if it isn't, I focus on other parts of what I'm making that don't involve writing. If neither are working, I simply forfeit the day.","Self-care is a requirement.","When it comes to melodies, production, and sound in pop music, people try to be formulaic and solely concerned with what's resonant in a way that is so cheap and ugly. It actually just devolves culture, ultimately.","Before I collaborate, it's important that I have a conversation about what I care about before we make anything, so that it's very clear.","At the end of the day, I would like to have the farthest reach in terms of being able to communicate to as many people as possible. So it's not that I enjoy being obscure; it's that I sonically don't want to be situated here or there.","I want to speak in the tradition of rhythm and blues and soul music, but also push how it's dressed and how it's delivered to the audience. And hopefully that gets embraced by as many people as possible, but the goal isn't necessarily to speak to everyone. The goal is to get it out as exact as it is in my head.","I would say there is a zone of R&B that hadn't been quite innovative.","Innovating something that is familiar. That's the general approach, and that's what I want to do with the melody as well. It should ring true - you should like every melody sequence without knowing what's happening next.","It is very rare that I am just coming up with melodies off the top of my head. I usually am responding to something - it could be chains dragging on the floor - but I am usually responding to something.","For those of us who make music together, I think it's important to realize that generosity on both sides is actually going to produce the biggest possibility.","I'm quite scrutinous when it comes to who I put myself in the room with.","No one is making extraordinary things alone. They might be alone in their bedroom while they're recording or writing, but they didn't actually conjure that thing out of nothing - without influence - without assistance - without anything.","Music in the U.K. is not racialised in the same way as it is in the U.S. In the U.S.. it's more rigid and conservative. And white people in the U.K. have more close proximity with black people and people of colour in general.","It means so much to be able to share myself with the world.","Most artists are going into the studio for a fixed period of time, and they say that's their album. I can't relate, because I've never made music in that way. I come from a culture of editing and remixing.","Growing up in an Ethiopian household allowed me to feel like I had an audience before I had an audience.","In Maryland, I didn't grow up around poor white people. Where I grew up, the white people were middle class or upper-middle class. It's interesting how screwed up it is in reality, because most people who receive assistance from the government are white, but not in my head or in my experience.","I know my ticket is vulnerability. Most people point to some emotional experience, some hardship, some high or low when they talk about my music... a time when they need to feel those feelings more.","I remember the day I first heard what Timbaland and Aaliyah did - that intersection of her pretty voice and his weird, resonant production. I remember where I was and what I was doing. It was a major situation. We're trying to continue that legacy.","I'm coming from the zone of Faith Evans, but with weird production.","I don't care about the underground, even if that's where I'm currently residing sonically.","We don't want it to be obscure music. We're not trying to be indie. We want to be popular.","I want to soundtrack people's layered feelings.","Even on my most angry song, I'm also still saying, 'Thank you for helping me to learn.' I've always wanted to give voice to that complexity in our experience.","That's pretty much how every song of mine works - I start with gibberish and melody and phrasing. I speak it naturally first. And then I think about lyrics that fit into that.","The most rewarding thing for someone like me is for someone else to find solace through my music.","I'm very into familiar things, popular things. I'm into things that no one seems to know about or be into. I'm trying to draw a line between those two things and make it clear... that it all makes sense to me. That it's not disparate. That it's all one thing inside me.","How much closer can I get to the common ear, the mainstream, and how much it can still be from this other world, this other place? That's the line I keep trying to tread but have my wings extend more on both sides.","I'm definitely seeking to challenge tropes.","Sounding like I have agency in a song is important to me. I want to feel empowered by the music.","It's gratifying to hear something familiar and challenging at the same time.","I'd like to change what people expect. I want to evoke something that's not nameable, for people to go, 'Huh?'","The whole thing about 'progressive R&B' blows my mind. Black music has always been progressive.","I try to make it a sonic experience so that when you put your earbuds in or when you're in your room, it sounds like an enveloping feeling. I think that is the most important thing, that wherever you are, it is wrapping you up and making you feel safe and comfortable."],"Kelis":["Being the ideal of a strong woman means utilizing all the things that God gives you. People are always saying to me, 'You're a strong female, so why are you wearing a bikini on the cover of that magazine?' Being a strong woman is misconstrued to be something evil and ugly.","For me, saying 'I'm bossy' is a cute, tongue-in-cheek way of saying that I'm in control of my life.","I don't think people know me at all. At the end of the day, if you see me in sequins and glitter out at a club, you might think that's all there is. But, you know, it's just glitter. My friends who I've known since I was 17 - they know who I am.","I studied to be a chef as a side thing, a little hobby that I enjoyed doing, but I ended up falling madly in love with the food and the lifestyle.","I can't live without Eucerin cream, lip gloss, gum, nail polish, and sparkly things.","Growing up, my mom had a catering business. I used to help her pretty early on and loved doing it. My mom is an amazing cook, and she helped me cultivate a love for food. She taught me that food can be beautiful. We eat not just for survival, but we survive to eat. It's part of who I am.","The music industry is a world of smoke and mirrors: they tell you exactly what they think you want to hear. And they are bare-faced lying. I tend to stay away from that.","The album 'Kelis Was Here' sucked the life out of me, and so I went off and studied to be a Cordon Bleu chef. What's great about food is that it's less about who you know and what you look like, and more about if you're any good.","Everything I do has a certain quality, a certain flair, a certain flavor. I like to eat the way I like to dress, the way I listen to music: put it all together, and it's a great party.","I've done a lot of different tours. For me, I try to go on tours that I think are gonna be fun. It's, like, grueling, and it's hard, and there's got to be an element to it that's exciting.","My mom was concerned that us four little black girls have a really well-balanced life. She wanted us to be around people like us, but we also went to private school and traveled all the time. Now I fit in most places because I've been most places.","I had always been a fan of Nas, but I never met him. This is the one guy in the industry who's, like, the phantom rapper.","Am I R&B because I'm black? Am I pop because I have a song called 'Milkshake'? Or can I just be who the hell I am? Good Lord, people make it seem like we're doing heart transplants here, but we're just making music!","I was never an R&B artist. People coined me one, but that's because, especially if you're in the States, if you're black and you sing, then you're R&B.","After 'Kelis Was Here,' I was done. I was like, 'I will never put out another record again; I hate this business; I hate all these people.' I was in this race that I didn't even realise that I was in.","My desire was never to put out albums; it was to do musical theatre!","There's a point where you think, 'What else will I do if I don't do music?' It becomes your identity when it never should have been. But food ignited a fire in me, and I came right back to music because it no longer felt like a job. It was a really powerful thing for me.","I'm a multi-platinum recording artist; my passion is food.","Everyone's attention span is getting shorter. As a result, everything - films, music, art - gets watered down and dumber. Every now and again, you get something great, but not often.","There's a difference between a pop star and an artist. Pop stars have to be perfect all the time; an artist is allowed, on occasion, to suck. And I put myself in that category because I sometimes suck. I'm not trying to please the masses. It's not going to happen, so I don't try.","As a child, I'd help my mum cook, and it was ridiculous - she had the correct gadget or utensil for everything. 'Stop! Don't use that, I have exactly the right utensil.' After I left home, I survived on cup-a-meals and never saw myself as being like her. Now I've become her.","My last supper would be a charcuterie smorgasbord with every kind of meat, and sauces to dip them in.","As a chef, if I can taste something, I can basically figure out what's in it.","The key to sauces is having patience. I'm not a patient woman, but I learned with sauces that you have to get everything on a slow roll and layer the flavors. That's where you get robust tastes: it starts one way and ends another.","My audience is made up of such bizarre, rare people. They're very sparse and scattered; it's not like a huge body of people.","People know 'Milkshake' like a jingle, but they don't really know who I am.","In my life, looking at other women who have been pregnant while writing, I always feel like it's kind of their most musical or the closest to themselves. I think for me it's such a validating moment, you know. I always knew I wanted to have kids, and I've been making music all my life.","The business of music. You know, it's an oxymoron in a sense. It's like the two things. Although we both need each other, they really don't go together.","In food, it's really, like, either you're right, or you're wrong. You know, people's taste buds kind of vary, but there's a technique. Either you do it right, or you don't.","As a black artist in America, you know, it is so segregated as far as the radio goes and how they position music on the radio.","I needed a break, and going to culinary school turned a lightbulb on that I didn't have to make music. The people in the music business forget that not only is there an entire world of people out there who do not care what we do, we are not creating the wheel.","I love lifestyle stuff, I love housewares. I'm really a homebody, honestly. Anything to do with my kitchen, or my house, I'm all about it. I'm working on a sauce line, so that's kind of exciting. I'm a saucier.","I don't ever want to part with any of my shoes. They all have a special place in my heart because they say something about who you are today."],"Kelita Zupancic":["Just dream big. Anything is possible.","We train and work so hard in our sport, we would be nothing less than a warrior. Day in, day out, this is our life. It's everything. The Olympic dream.","At the end of the day, you can only fight from yourself. It is only you out there on that mat - but it sure helps knowing you have a great team of supporters cheering for you!","I have my Grade 1 autobiography that says I'm going to the 2012 Olympic Games, and it has a picture of me on the podium. So, I've known my whole life. It's not something I just thought of. I've known I would be an Olympic athlete; didn't know what sport, but I drew myself in a judo gi.","Definitely, I got a reputation growing up playing on the guys' hockey teams. The guys knew how tough I was because I played with them. I got quite a good reputation for beating up boys going up through school.","To be an Olympic athlete is an honour, a privilege. They're so respected. This is my dream. I have to do this.","With three younger brothers, we were always very competitive and combative. But my mother always says I get the drive from her.","During practice, I train with both women and men. I think it's good to have a mixture of strengths because both have different fighting styles. Every person offers something different, and the more body types you get used to, the better fighter you will become.","I grew up with three younger brothers, so it was always 'compete against your brothers.' I've always had to stand up for myself. I love that. I love proving myself, that women can be just as good as men.","A strong, powerful, successful woman is always intimidating.","The Olympics were life-changing for me. I felt I went in as a girl and came out as a woman.","Taking care of my skin so that it's healthy and glowing, especially with all the travelling and training, is important and makes me feel presentable. I don't wear makeup when I compete, and that's when I'm photographed the most, so I have to make sure it looks good!","When I'm not working out, it's important to me to express the creative, girly side of my personality.","People often don't believe me when they first meet me and I tell them I'm a judoka. I then show them my arms, which speak for themselves.","That's why I liked judo so much right from the start - I got to beat up all the boys."],"Kellan Lutz":["I love life way too much and find fun in almost anything. I'm a chameleon.","Because I'm always away, coming home to a clean house means a lot to me. Trust me, I've lived with a lot of roommates, and straight guys are just kids who don't pick up after themselves.","With my feelings, I hold a lot in, because I didn't always have boundaries and people would take advantage of situations because I'm a nice guy.","I have no real tattoos. I wear my bruises and tons of scars as my tattoos.","I'm really into extreme sports and just having fun.","I love having candles, especially when you get downtime. I could just pass out seeing the flame flicker with the lights off.","As far as 'Twilight' goes, I'm in love with my character. I'm in love with the whole series. I love doing the fan conventions around the world, I love to travel. So wherever it fits in, I'd love to continue doing that for the rest of my life. Just meeting the fans who made everything possible from around the world.","When I was doing 'Generation Kill' in Africa I worked with five really super-trained Navy SEALs who taught us all these moves like how to disarm people: if there's a bar fight and someone's got a chair or there's someone with a gun behind our head, how to disable them and take them down in a swift move.","I just loved going fast. So I started out with Alka-Seltzer and soda water in a bottle and attached it to the skateboard. That didn't do much. I would try a leaf blower. I was searching for anything that would go fast. Then, the lawnmower engine.","The coolest part about seeing a girl wear something comfortable is the smile that you can just feel coming through from inside her.","I like a girl to wear oversize sweaters that look like my own - it's beyond sexy.","I want to fly a jet. I'd love to just be in the air and go mach 3 or mach 4. Or, I'd be an underwater salvager. I've always been fascinated with the Bermuda Triangle and Atlantis. I love chemistry, also. That's why acting is so random for me!","I worked my butt off in high school and received a lot of scholarships for college and to throw all that away for acting was tough for my family, but it was just something I felt my heart pulling me towards and don't regret a single minute of it. I love to act!","Lucky Justin Timberlake has Jessica Biel. I think she would just be the coolest girl to hang out with.","I love those kids on 'The Suite Life of Zack and Cody.' I remember when they were little they looked like they were having so much fun just being kids. And that's how I was growing up and how I try to be.","You can't just build a huge chest and arms. You need to work out your body evenly. Otherwise, A, you'll look weird, and B, it's not the best for your body.","I have a lot of older brothers who messed up in different ways in my mother's eyes. So I learned from all of their mistakes. I can't go into detail, but while I was growing up, I always tried to make it a goal to relieve some of the stress my mother went through.","In L.A., I was meeting people who were all actors. My mind started to open up to what acting was. I didn't realize that Brad Pitt was a real person. I didn't think he was a robot or a machine, but I thought you were just born into acting - that it's a family tree, kind of like NASCAR. No one can just say, 'Hey, I'm going to be a NASCAR driver.'","It's weird that the world sees modeling as a negative. It just blows my mind how many people think that because I was a model, I think I'm pretty and that I can use my looks to get ahead. I'm not pretty!","I'd love to do a movie like 'The Machinist.' It's an extreme movie but it takes you to a place that is quite impressive.","Actors strive to be part of something like 'Twilight' and what 'Twilight' is, is unbelievable.","I am very picky with my career. I don't need to do it for the money or the fame. I'm very choosy, which is why I haven't played the typical role that people expect to see from someone of my stature and size, as the mean jock or the preppy. It's very easy to see me like that. That's why I go against it in different roles.","I love playing the bad guy getting away with stuff. I was that kid who learned from my older brothers who got away with everything by smiling.","I could definitely take someone out with my bare hands.","I'm really great with weapons: I did a lot of bo and staff training for 'Immortals.' I love knives. I'm a pretty good shot. But I love hand-to-hand combat.","I probably have more friends from 'Twilight' than I've ever had in my whole life.","I love to take risks, I love to travel, and I'm very outdoor-sy, so any girl who can pick up a football and throw a spiral will definitely catch my attention.","I've been training with my mixed martial arts guy as much as I can when I'm back in L.A., so if I could do another movie like I did in 'The Killing Game,' with Samuel L. Jackson, that would be awesome.","I love someone who tries to boss me around.","When I'm at craft services, I make the best-tasting, 10-layer meat and cheese sandwich with no bread.","I did Hilary Duff's 'With Love' music video-slash-fragrance ad.","'Twilight' is such an amazing project, and I think it opened up doors for all of us cast members.","Producers and studios know what sells. It's nice to be one of the guys that can help sell a movie by taking his shirt off.","By no means do I want to be a piece of meat for the rest of my career. It's funny when you get asked to do a talk show, and then they follow it up with requesting you take your shirt off.","I don't Google myself, but I've heard that people think I'm gay. I've heard it all.","See, I don't really go after girls. Most of the girlfriends I've had have come after me. So it's really funny when girls get offended because I don't hit on them.","When I meet gay fans out and about, they're so great to talk to - and I'm big on hugging, because I'm from the Midwest. They're just so energetic and loving. I'm proud to have those fans, and their support means a lot to me. I don't want just girls coming to my movies; I want guys to come, too!","I was blessed, because I come from a family where they knock you down before you float away. I have a lot of brothers who just make sure we have our feet on the ground, and my mom is a rock star. She is an amazing mother.","Hats off to starting a franchise younger than we all did in 'Twilight' and keeping your cool. The 'Harry Potter' men and women had, what, a 10-year run?","I love to read. I have a Kindle, and it's nice to be able to download books that people refer.","I finish so many books it's amazing. I'm also doing Rosetta Stone, learning some French.","When we're on set, we kind of joke around, and when we're rehearsing, we change up the scenes and make each other laugh. We lighten up the mood. The blooper reel is going to be amazing on 'New Moon.'","My agent and I try to be picky with roles so that I can drive my career in different directions and be different, creative characters. I want to be an actor for the rest of my life and to have fun with my career. So I told him that I wish I could do a movie that already has a fan base. And then 'Twilight' came along!","I used to wear sweats and a T-shirt to auditions, but my agent would yell at me and tell me I had to look nice and presentable. So I had to drop that habit.","I don't have TiVo, but I watch a lot of 'Judge Judy' - it makes me happy about my life when I see what the people on that show do.","I've never broken a bone in my body, even though I've done some extreme things.","I've had girl friends who've said they liked me, and it's like, 'Look, it's not gonna go anywhere,' but if you say that nicely, then you can still be friends.","I've dated girls and I always wait for that one right time to kiss. I don't kiss on the first date, so I'll take a girl out to dinners, and we'll go bowling, and I make sure to charm them before I do it.","I love the idea of marriage. I definitely want marriage and little Kellans running around.","I don't really like the gym. I like to fool my body. I run around the beach and then there's scaffolding so I can just do different pulls-ups there.","I bet on everything. Everything. It's just like, 'I bet you I can spin my chair longer.' Everything, I say 'I bet you.' I love to win.","To be completely honest, I didn't know 'Twilight' was a book.","A lot of girls in L.A. just stand in the corner wondering 'Who's gonna talk to me? Who am I gonna diss?'","A lot of girls think they have flaws that really aren't flaws. I've never met a girl who was just so secure about everything.","I lived in a tiny Midwest town, so I was always looking for adventure.","You could do a hundred projects and still not have the fans that are there for Twilight.","I was actually away in Africa doing 'Generation Kill' while everyone was auditioning for Twilight. They all had, like, five different auditions: I was so lucky that I came back from Africa just in time and the actor who was playing Emmett fell through, lucky for me!","I am so fidgety - I swear I have ADD - and I always need to be doing something or being outside, just playing sports.","I think fans are just obsessed with the 'Twilight' saga and then within it they might have preferences between if they're Team Jacob, Team Edward or Team Jasper. It just comes down to them loving the whole thing, and if they can get any of the boys from the book they are fine with that.","Even in high school, I had friends that I didn't know were gay until years later. I'd find out on Facebook or something and be like, 'Oh, that explains some things,' or 'Wow, no wonder they were so cool.'","I don't want to be known as the guy who always takes his shirt off... I've done a lot of photo shoots lately for the press coming up with 'Immortals' and 'Breaking Dawn,' and every photographer wants to get the topless shot. We've really had to be choosy and not do that for every magazine. I've actually been trying to keep my clothes on more.","I love mythology, grew up loving it. I'm a middle kid, big family, that's the thing you did in the farm country. I lived in Iowa, I loved mythology. I don't know, we're like that.","It's funny when people say you have sex appeal or call you the next Brad Pitt. I just laugh. I'm not that. I don't want to be that.","My genetics are good, but they aren't crazy He-Man style.","I had so many older brothers who beat up on me, so I'm a tough kid. I love mixed martial arts, weapons training, guns, knives, driving fast cars and motorcycles.","I always wanted to play a Greek god in something.","I love Poseidon. His trident - his weapon - is really cool.","Motion capture is amazing. I prefer it. You wear a 'Power Ranger'-esque suit, you have tape balls on you, you have 60 cameras around you capturing your every movement and there's no hair, no makeup.","When I'm in love with a woman, seeing her in something cozy makes me not want to let go of her when I'm holding her.","I've been blessed with a good head on my shoulders and quite a good ability of discernment. I can see through people.","I've been very much intrigued by and impressed with women. But I've never been intimidated. Even if I make a fool of myself, it's better to have tried.","I have a Bible study that my friends and I go to here in L.A. I go to church every Sunday. I've always been a believer. I love singing. I don't have the best voice - I just love getting my emotions out.","I started out modeling at a young age and surrounded myself with different brilliant minds. I have so many people to get educated from, and I've been a sponge.","What I've learned from different designers is that it's key to be true to who you are and your vision. That's always been my line of thinking. Working through the whole design process, I don't want to create something I wouldn't be proud to wear.","'Immortals' is all action. I love action movies. That's really where I want to spearhead my career.","I have always loved fashion, but I have no expertise in it besides being a model.","It's all about the quality of the fabric, how soft it is and feeling comfortable in what you're wearing.","As long as I can wear something that's not too tight, I can move in it, it's not too thick, and I can breathe, it's great."],"Kelley Armstrong":["Reviews are great. I can read negative reviews and say, 'You know that point they made... they were dead on.'","I don't read much of what I write because I worry about unintentionally borrowing something.","Storytelling is my passion, and it rises from a love of reading.","Even in horror novels where you know most characters aren't going to make it to the end, it's crucial to have fully fleshed-out characters. If you don't do that, the reader doesn't care what happens to them.","Especially in the world of fantasy and superheroes, it's great to have role models that aren't in skimpy little outfits, in impossible poses. That's so important for young women.","I grew up writing about the paranormal, and I blame too many Saturday mornings watching 'Scooby Doo.'","It wasn't until I was in my teens that I started admiring writers as inspirations for my own work, and my earliest influences there were Stephen King, Marion Zimmer Bradley and Richard Adams.","The first piece of 'long' fiction I wrote was a novella parody of Stephen King's 'Christine.' I was in high school, and my version was about a kid with a possessed locker instead of a possessed car. It was also my first attempt at humour, which fell completely flat because no one who read it realized it was a parody!","It took many years to accept that fantasy is the fuel for my storytelling passion, and without that, I really am a hack, writing for money or approval rather than for the pure delight of storytelling.","Young writers need to be encouraged to write - just write - with no restrictions on form, style or content.","When a series is doing well, it's very tempting to keep writing it, even when the creative well is drying up. It's tempting because that's where the money is. I've had to be very careful; as soon as I think I'm getting close to that dry well, I wrap the series up. I don't want to just keep writing something because it sells.","Everyone is the sum total of past experiences. A character doesn't just spring to life at age thirty.","I always worried that the creative well would dry up. I was sure that if I wrote a book a year, I would eventually run out of ideas. Actually, the opposite has been true for me. The more I write, the more ideas come to me and it gets easier.","There is no story that can't be improved by adding zombies."],"Kelley O'Hara":["For me it's just about that self-confidence and finding what you love and just chasing after it with reckless abandon and never letting anyone tell you that you can't do something.","Your No. 1 priority as a defender is to keep the ball out of the back of the net.","If you have people invested emotionally in the success of their team, that usually translates to strong attendance.","I drink coffee every day, either espresso or cortado, which is two shots espresso and steamed milk.","Be the best teammate you can be, be the best player you can be, and just be as supportive and encouraging for the people who are playing.","I'm lenient when it comes to nutrition rules. I enjoy cooking and baking in general, and I just try to eat whole, clean foods. I try to stay away from processed or boxed stuff - but that's not to say I don't eat that from time to time. I really like making Asian noodle salad and also make soup a lot, like tortilla soup.","I actually don't wear any makeup when I'm on the field. I like looking nice, but my main concern is how I play - to me, if you look and feel good, then you play good. On the field, I only wear Coppertone Sport SPF 30. I like it because it feels like I'm putting on lotion rather than SPF.","For me, it's really important to take care of my skin. Especially because when I see someone, and they're just so fresh and beautiful, you always notice their skin first. So having a really good skin-care regimen is a must. I just wish I would have started taking care of my skin earlier!","I first started drinking chocolate milk to refuel in college when one of my assistant coaches said there were studies that proved that lowfat chocolate milk was great for recovery, so after practice, we would get out two big gallons and drink it together as a team.","The summer before my senior year of college, I would surf every single morning, and I got better and loved it. For me, it is nice to get away from the soccer field and have these other things to clear your mind. You don't have to be good at it; you just do it and enjoy it. It is nice to have that balance, and I need that balance in my life.","Nothing can replace sleep, but coffee can do it best. I love coffee.","I'm from Georgia and grew up eating Chick-fil-A. I'm obsessed with all forms of fried chicken, like chicken briskets and chicken sandwiches.","No excuses. Play like a champion.","This is the whole reason you play: to win your country a World Cup!","When I was in middle school and even high school, I wasn't comfortable with my body. I look back, and it makes me sad, but I've grown into my body and really embrace it. I don't have the typical girl body; I'm kind of built like a boy.","I love how I look. My favorite body part is my butt because that's where we get all our power from, and that's what keeps me going up and down the field and drives my explosiveness. I kind of have a bubble butt, but it helps me do what I need to do!","I don't tend to wear a lot of makeup in general.","I used to apply waterproof mascara before a game - it was the easiest thing to wear while I was playing that wouldn't sweat off - but not anymore.","As a sub, you just want to help your team in whatever way you can.","I think soccer in America is growing exponentially, and it's just going to keep getting bigger.","Soccer is a cruel sport sometimes.","It's fun to be able to dress up from time to time and pretend that I don't wear cleats, a T-shirt, and shorts every day.","I have a ton of broken baby hairs in front. It just comes with the territory of being a soccer player.","I could wear a dress one day and boyfriend jeans the next. I usually just want to make sure I'm comfortable.","I don't like feeling full when I start a game, so that's why I have a bigger meal in morning or four hours before game.","It's fun scoring goals, but I also like to stop them.","I think I was just a very competitive child.","Inspiring people to look at their goals and go for that and believe in themselves is amazing.","If you have a goal and you set your mind to it, you can absolutely achieve it.","It's not easy not getting playing time, but you have to keep showing up and working your tail off to be ready.","I'm down for anything.","Life is awesome as a college athlete, and then it's a total cliff to jump off.","What you do on the field can only be a positive if you take care of what you need to off the field, and that means recovery and refueling.","I remember watching the '96 Olympics. For some reason, I was like 'Oh yeah, I'm going to go to the Olympics some day.' At that time as a kid, I did not know for what sport or really anything.","Surfing was something I always wanted to do.","I love to get out there and sweat and mix things up, whether I'm on the field or in the gym.","Got to go to the ESPYs, which was so cool.","I would say I eat pretty clean for the most part. Everything in moderation. I don't deny myself.","I started playing soccer when I was 4 because my sister was doing it. It was my first organized sport, and my parents thought this was a great way to get coordinated and be part of a team. I had an array of options but eventually figured out soccer was best for me.","It's every little girl's dream to go onto the World Cup.","They were some of the best years of my life, and I'm so thankful I was able to go to Stanford.","When I go into games as a forward, my job is really clear, and I just have to execute. But as a midfielder, you get to sort of enjoy the game more, and you get to feel the game and dictate the play.","I still have that forward's mentality that when I have the chances, it just ticks me off if I can't put it in.","Soccer fans spend almost as much time outdoors as we do! Whether you're heading out onto the field for practice or cheering from the sidelines, throw a broad spectrum sunscreen into your bag to help protect your skin from the sun."],"Kelli Berglund":["Most people don't know that I'll eat anything spicy. A little extra kick is always a good thing!","Going to work is probably my favorite thing to do. I do that five days a week for probably ten hours a day, but it doesn't even feel like work and it shouldn't. When you enjoy a job so much like I do, it's not work, it's play.","I would love to get into feature films; I'm willing to do an action flick, I'm willing to do a romantic comedy.","I think it'd be the coolest thing if I could get a role in a dance movie. That's something I'm always going to love.","I would love to work with Kristin Wiig one day. I find her hilarious, and I totally idolize her.","As a teenage girl myself, I've gone through times in my life where I've felt insecure about who I am and have tried so hard to fit in with everyone else.","I would love to be able to read minds. How cool would it be to get inside peoples' heads and figure out what they're thinking? I guess that's a good and a bad thing.","Most people don't know that I have a huge phobia of bugs. It's gotten worse and worse over the years, but I just can't stand them! Even thinking about bugs makes me queasy.","I love Demi Lovato's style. It's really different, but it's super chic and has a cool edge to it. I'm always trying to channel her style when going shopping for new clothes or getting dressed in the morning.","I had a great chemistry teacher and found it really interesting to learn how things are made up and how they work.","No matter how busy I am, I find time for dance.","Comedy has always been more challenging for me than drama.","I know that dancers, especially ballet dancers, can't do it forever."],"Kelli Garner":["In fact, I'm a geek.","I seem to be attracted to the quiet, brooding type. But not too brooding. Too brooding can be narcissistic. Or psychotic.","I want a guy who can clean my gutters and kill my spiders - who's simple yet layered.","I like men who are more in their heads.","Hollywood can be an ugly place and it can do ugly things to you."],"Kelli Giddish":["It's always cool on the airplane when people are watching 'SVU.' It's funny. And it's always the reruns.","I'd been on 'SVU' before and I'd been on 'Criminal Intent,' but I wasn't a follower. Like, my mom watches every episode, even before I was on it.","It's a luxury being able to work every day in the streets of Manhattan. It doesn't get much cooler than that. When you move to New York, that's exactly what you dream of. And I'm doing it.","I had never been to Texas. I'd been through Texas, but I'm so glad to be back in a place that's not L.A. or New York. To talk about Dallas, to talk about there being sweet tea on the catering table, it's rich and saturated in American-ness.","I went down for a week with the Houston Marshals. I didn't know that they hated paperwork as much as I hated it. They loathe it, man. They want to be in their cars catching the bad guys. They don't want to be filling out paperwork about the bad guys, you know, and the ones they've caught."],"Kelli O'Hara":["I suppose there are a lot of reasons to be jaded or sarcastic or bitter in life, but I hang on to the reasons why life is beautiful.","I don't ever think about the roads I didn't take because I spend too much time thinking what's ahead. I don't go backwards.","The 'Carousel' overture has always been one of my all-time favorite pieces of music.","I've had great opportunities to show different sides of myself, but the challenge will always be getting either people to let you do it or finding the right things to do in order to do it.","I don't want to be famous for being famous.","Corned beef and cabbage - that's our favorite holiday meal when all the O' Haras gather around the table.","It is such a luxury to open a new book that's highly recommended by friends - either an inspirational yet humorously self-deprecating memoir, or a page-turning piece of fiction.","Some songs depend heavily on the character, but, for the most part, a great song begs for reinterpretation every time it is sung, even when in character.","I was able to do concerts all the way up until two weeks before I had the baby; I thought I was stopping a month ahead, but he was three weeks early.","When you step out and do a song in a musical, the easier thing to do is make it funny. But when those transitions become necessary, when they aren't camp, that, to me, is magic. I've done musical comedies and enjoyed them, but subject matter that's deeper and more realistic is always what's appealed to me most.","I was raised in Oklahoma. I was actually born in Tulsa, but I grew up in a small town on the west side of Oklahoma called Elk City on a farm, where my dad grew up, actually.","I've been singing since I was nine or ten.","I loved to sing and I loved to act, and I didn't want to continue opera because I wanted to act.","By no means, I can't sing any rock and roll.","Everyone's story is different, and we can't really be inside them.","When you're pregnant, things - at least for me - get very sincere and very wholesome, and it's about family, and singing becomes about warmth.","I think anything emotional adds to your acting and singing, no matter what it is that you go through. It will always add to it, never take away.","I grew up on a farm.","My degree was in opera.","It's really important that I have a personal life.","To play a character is to inhabit the world and the life of that character.","Playing characters allows me to do things I may not always do, while singing in concerts allows me to really find my own voice and grow.","It's always hard - it's a little counterintuitive to leave your baby at any point during the infancy.","Everyone has these ideas, especially about the middle of the country, about people being backwards and three-toothed.","Every part has its relief when I'm done with it.","I feel so rich in my emotions and in my life and so grateful when I'm home and so grateful when I'm at work.","When I've done TV and film, when it's offered to me, I loved doing it, and I would do it again, but the ins and outs of auditioning is - that's time away from my kids.","When I was a kid, I would sing in people's living rooms and for different little family things.","'South Pacific' has a definite heaviness that people don't realize. It's got a seriousness and a message.","My mom's side of the family is from Arkansas!","There is such a cliche to certain roles that all I can do is to try to make them realistic and work for the times, and so the audience actually won't see me as a caricature of something, but rather as an actual person.","I love playing an ingenue, and I love doing revivals, and I will continue to do that.","I'm proud to be Irish.","My great-grandfather, Peter O'Hara, was born in Ireland, I believe, in County Clare. His father, my great-great-grandfather, had actually come to America a generation before when times were very bad in Ireland. He worked in the Pennsylvania area and did well with horses and farming.","My father named me Kelli because 'Kelli O'Hara' just sounded so Irish.","I never really try to watch the movie of the things I've been in.","I'm a mother, and when you have children, there's a protection. You'll do a lot to protect them, to do what's best for them.","I've always wanted my characters to have more dimension and realistic cores than the ingenue material often provides. It's been a challenge.","I think it can be a good idea to know what you do well and use that to open the door for yourself. Once you open the door, close it behind you, and start to make changes.","I don't mind talking about my family and how to balance it all. But, in today's world, we should probably be asking both women and men about work and family and how to balance the two.","I've always wanted to do a Shakespeare play.","You breathe fast when you're scared.","Shakespeare has great ability to skirt around a subject and portray human nature.","We didn't have a lot of live theater in Oklahoma. I didn't visit New York when I was growing up. I watched movie musicals, and I believed in an idealistic, idyllic version of Broadway.","The hardest role that I've ever tried to play was Clara Johnson in 'Light in the Piazza' at Lincoln Center. It was the least fun I've ever had, but the most beautiful experience I've ever had. I could not understand her. I could not put my feet in her shoes. I came home every night, and I was depressed.","I don't read reviews, because if you believe the good ones, you have to believe the bad.","If I get tickled in a certain way, I actually lose the ability to stand. I don't mean to, but something happens to my knees, and I fall on the ground.","I don't have that many family and friends.","With a revival, you're compared to somebody else.","In my special place, room service could only consist of my husband making me a breakfast of eggs, avocados, and hummus. And coffee with milk.","I love to play things that are out-of-the-box. It's just that I don't always get the chance to do it!","I don't ever sing classically when I am singing a contemporary score - I kind of try to fit in whatever needs to happen."],"Kelli White":["You could run harder, longer. If the workout was four 200s really, really fast, they wouldn't seem as hard as before. You could cut the rest down from five minutes to three. That's a big difference.","I felt that to do this drug, I had to become someone totally different than I was. I had to compromise my integrity, my value system. I knew it was so wrong.","I look at that person and I'm like, That's not Kelli White. That's not who I am, who I started out to be.","I felt betrayed by him, extremely betrayed. He made me believe that if I followed a certain protocol of supplements and different drugs that I could become number 1 in the world.","I felt that there were so many people doing it that I would just be like one of the others.","The acne thing was bad. The shoulders, the face, my voice changed. I had a period every other week.","It got to be so easy that I was actually disappointed.","I have never taken any substance to enhance my performance.","It sounded good. It was a story that Victor Conte told me to use. I was contacted by Dr. Goldman, and that's how the story came about. And that was my first time ever meeting, or speaking, to Dr. Goldman.","I'm not sure exactly what Victor told Dr. Goldman, but I don't think he fully knew what was going on... I think he was really oblivious. I don't think he knew."],"Kelli Williams":["I'm convinced that I've been hired for jobs because I can cry on cue.","'The Practice' I was on for seven years and it was a law show, so I really - a lot of objections and things like that, lots of long, long monologues that David Kelly used to write me, which were great. I was really lucky to have my first show go that long.","We go to the opening arguments or the closing arguments of a case, and we'd see which actor got the big one. I had a seven-page one once which just about killed me, and I thought, 'Oh, I'm going to get fired, that's it, I can't do it.' It was like a one-act play, and I had a few weeks to learn it, luckily. But it's terrifying.","I had a ton of animals; I had a goat growing up, a bunch of rabbits, a vegetable garden.","In a first pregnancy, you don't have a child yet, so you can nap and see movies and exercise. The notion of 'baby' is abstract. You look at the ultrasound and don't really understand that the creature you're seeing is soon going to be your roommate.","I do prenatal yoga and walk a lot.","I love that time when all you want to do is cocoon with your baby in your own little world, when you carry them around all the time in a little pouch or sling."],"Kellie Martin":["I would say people remember me from 'Life Goes On' more than anything.","I love doing television series.","I wouldn't want to be a superstar, like Julia Roberts or Madonna, and be on the cover of 'US' magazine when I'm twenty - that's how you know you're really hot. I'd rather have a long, respected career.","The way I choose parts is I look at the scripts... I choose a part by whether or not it challenges me.","I want to become a very good writer.","I want to know art.","It's not imperative that I graduate in four years, and it's not imperative that I get all A's."],"Kellie Pickler":["Surround yourself with positive people and you'll be a positive person.","'Things that Never Cross a Man's Mind' is probably one of my favorite upbeat tempo songs because it is just a sassy song, and it's a fun song.","You should never doubt yourself because you never, ever know what's around the corner.","Cancer does not discriminate.","My grandfather is a retired Marine, and I've always had a great deal of respect for anyone who serves our country.","When we went to Iraq, we stayed in one of Saddam's palaces. It was kind of creepy. If those walls could talk, there's no telling what stories they'd tell.","The more you perform and get out there, I guess the more practice you have at it and the better you are and the more comfortable you are on stage.","I don't talk to myself or anything, but sometimes I say things and I laugh at myself. Sometimes you have to make fun of yourself.","There's one place that I've always known I wanted to be, and that is on country radio.","I was tossed all over the place growing up, which I guess prepared me for the music business, but the one thing that has always been there, that has never ever left me, has been country music.","The thing is, my life is a country song. I don't need to be manufactured, and I don't need anyone to tell me what to say or what to sing.","I collaborated with fellow cat lover and designer Geren Ford to create a sweater that we hope any cat parent would wear to show their kitty pride and that all animal lovers can wear in support of the ASPCA.","The USO tours I've been part of have definitely been the highlight of my career and my life."],"Kellin Quinn":["I always want to surprise myself, more than anybody else.","I know that starting out as a young band, it's really easy to get lost with bands that sound the same or with the plethora of music that's out there.","Anyone in the Tooth & Nail or Drive-Thru scene was my thing.","I like to write about things that don't reflect exactly on my life.","A huge thing for me growing up was going to see my favorite bands and feeling like, 'Okay, cool, they proved themselves and did things in a special way.' That's the most important thing.","I think fans going to concerts expect more today in terms of meeting and things. It's cool - I get it because of how the Internet has made things much more personal for fans to follow with Facebook, Twitter and everything - but I also think it's kind of hindering because it takes from the music in a way.","When I went to shows with my friends, it was all about the experience with my friends. If I met the band, it was cool. But it was more about talking about the memories of the show with my friends.","It's kinda weird sometimes going on tour with bands because you never really know what to expect.","When I was growing up listening to music, it was 2004, when The Starting Line and Finch and The Used were kind of my favorite bands.","The 'Maybe Memories' album I remember having and listening until it broke. I remember it skipped one day; two or three songs wouldn't play on my CD player because I listened to it so much.","I grew up listening to The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, and every record those bands put out was very unique in its own right. I have that mentality. too: if a song sounds like something I've already done, then I'll throw it out, because I want each record to be a progression.","I am always thinking about writing music; my wife is constantly asking me: 'Is there any way you can turn off the music part of your brain for a minute?' but I really can't! It's my form of therapy.","For any band that ends up becoming really big, yeah, hard work has something to do with it, but a lot of it is just pure luck."],"Kelly Asbury":["We are all rebellious teenagers. Sometimes we grow out of it, and sometimes we don't.","Shrek is the Mickey Mouse of DreamWorks.","The Smurfs - and they're this way in Peyo's comics as well - do have a rubbery indestructibility about them. They can get bruised & battered. But they then just sort of bounce back very quickly, like those classic cartoon characters Wiley Coyote and Tom & Jerry.","Gnomes are supposed to be good luck in a garden, protecting against pests and diseases. A mythic gatekeeper, in the way a Kitchen Witch is.","If you look at it, 'The Lion King' is very similar to 'Hamlet.'","Star-crossed lovers who have a destiny that isn't necessarily going to work in their favor - that's a universal story; that's an archetypal story.","What, if not Shakespeare, is open for interpretation?","I think Baz Luhrmann's 'Romeo + Juliet' is a work of genius.","I think 'West Side Story' is one of the greatest, if not the greatest, musicals ever put onscreen - or stage, for that matter. I, frankly, like Zeffirelli's 'Romeo and Juliet' very much, too. I grew up with that... I loved it. I loved the score; I loved the acting.","I think what's universal about the story of 'Romeo and Juliet' is every one has grown up and done something that was rebellious against their parents' wishes, be it love or something else.","I don't want to be the one accused of ruining the Smurfs.","I wish I had been a child when the Smurfs came on television.","The way I choose voice talent is I don't let them tell me who the actor is.","My favorite films left the camera rest, and the actors and characters have a stage to act. Move the camera when it's motivating.","Every animated film that I've worked on - whether it was as a story artist or as Head of Story or even as director - where we originally started out with our story and where we eventually ended up were often very different places.","Tim Burton, let's face it: he's into stitches.","On 'Shrek,' Eddie Murphy was locked in as the donkey before we'd even designed the donkey.","It happens a lot that a name actor will be signed on to a project in its germ stage.","When you have a name actor, with a face that people recognise and a name that can go on posters or billboards and be able to appear on the talkshow circuit and tout the film, that's always a plus.","There's a lot of movies, and I've made some of them that could be categorized this way, but there's definitely been a trend in animated features of all types to be a little bit cynical, if you will, to have a little bit of 'knowing' humor to them, kind of a wink to the audience.","I look back at my childhood, and the films that I remember the most are things like 'Mary Poppins,' 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,' 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,' 'To Kill a Mockingbird.'","I think a film should be appropriate to what it's trying to say or the characters in it.","I love all sorts of movies, whether made by Scorsese or Frank Capra. I love them all.","A lot of people say to me, 'Is this good, to do to a Shakespeare piece?' And I think, 'You know, 'West Side Story' did it very cleverly, in a different way.' But if you look at 'Bonnie and Clyde,' 'Titanic,' 'Avatar,' 'Grease,' 'Brokeback Mountain'... they're all 'Romeo and Juliet' stories.","I think Shakespeare, at his heart, was just the way all of us are that make movies: He wanted to entertain people.","I've seen animation features just languish until the right combination of things come along to keep it alive.","What I want to impart on any movie I work on is I want to make it entertaining. That's what I feel I do.","I'm in the entertainment business, and I make commercially entertaining animated features.","I want the audience to walk out of the theater feeling they got their money's worth. Every movie that I enjoy, I leave the theater with something to take with me.","Smurfs must only eat Smurfberries. They can eat Smurfberry pie, they can have a Smurfberry sandwich, they can do whatever they want. But you can't have a Subway sandwich. It's got to be Smurfberries.","Films like 'The Wizard of Oz' and 'Shrek' are hits because they hit on different levels with different age groups. Striking that balance is what I strive for. But I won't know if I've done it until the audience sees it.","I actually applied at Hanna-Barbera to work on 'The Smurfs' when I got laid off for a brief period of time from Disney. I didn't get the job. That was my first introduction to Smurfs.","I'm a lover of the great adventure films of the 1980s: 'Goonies,' 'E.T.,' 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,' 'Star Wars.'","I wanted to create a world that presented the Smurfs with obstacles and challenges and really put them in a fish-out-of-water situation but also make them very active in getting out of their situation. Make them really the central characters.","Certainly in the case of 'Gnomeo & Juliet,' if it makes children or adults a little more interested in Shakespeare, there's nothing wrong with that!","I don't approach my movies with a target audience in mind. I try to make something that's true to the subject matter as much as possible, while still being entertaining and fun.","Animation tends to have several different writers who serve different functions. I think, on a lot of animated features, there are a lot of writers who don't get credited. It's the policy at Disney, for instance, in deciding who gets credit. It depends on the writer's contract, so many things.","In animation, there's not a medium I believe that's more collaborative. It is a team of people, of different disciplines, coming together. The decisions are made by consensus in many cases. My job as a director is to exercise the best judgement I can in terms of which decision is the best one to make for the movie."],"Kelly Ayotte":["I think that passion is the secret ingredient that drives hard work and excellence. My passion is to serve the public: to be in the arena of public policy, to have the opportunity to solve problems for our country, to be in a position where I can make a difference.","I believe that restricting the rights of law-abiding gun owners will not prevent a deranged individual or criminal from obtaining and misusing firearms to commit violence.","As a former attorney general. I have the greatest respect for the criminal justice system. But it is not good at intelligence gathering.","In the United States, because we are a nation of laws, you can lose an election and keep your life. In the United States, you can lose an election where you can disagree with our leaders or our government, and you won't lose your business; you won't lose your family, and you won't lose your freedom.","Unfortunately, no matter how frivolous the lawsuit, you still, of course, have to pay people to defend you on it.","If I am going to pick and choose the laws I defend, I wouldn't be doing my duty as attorney general.","You're really earning the support of New Hampshire voters, and you've got to do that one-on-one grassroots campaigning here, even if you have the most money.","We can't continue to kick the can when it comes to the fiscal state of this country.","I'm the only pro-life woman in the Senate. I take this issue very seriously. I'm the mother of two children.","Based on what our country stands for. We can't fail to stand for democracy.","None of us is certain about the outcome of the Arab Spring.","Carly Fiorina has campaigned hard in New Hampshire to earn support from voters.","The Russian economy is a one-trick pony. They're totally focused on natural gas and oil.","President Yanukovych, the deposed president, essentially, he gutted the Ukrainian military. And so I think we could provide some more assistance to them in that regard.","When I went back to New Hampshire after graduating from law school, my plan was to go work for a private firm because I had to pay some student loans off and make money and really just be in the private practice of law. Which can be very rewarding.","It is a privilege to serve the country in the United States Senate and serve the people of New Hampshire. I wake up every day with a sense of purpose."],"Kelly Bishop":["I accredit animals for keeping me going when times were bad.","I do have a mouth - I will say. I speak up when I see things I don't care for.","As much as I love to dance, and I still take class, aerobics and that sort of thing, and I still move very well and all of that - I'm really not a dancer anymore.","It's always a thrill to walk through a Broadway stage door.","I love stage actors. There's something special about all people who have to do a performance eight shows a week, and musical people, especially, are so much fun.","There is nothing more joyful to me than hearing a live audience laugh. Especially when I planned it that way!","I've been lucky enough to play some funny, nasty ladies in my day, and if you can make them foolish, they're even funnier."],"Kelly Brook":["What I am is how I came out. No one's perfect and you just have to accept your flaws and learn to love yourself.","People think you can't be clever if you have breasts.","I can't promise to love someone for ever. I can't imagine anyone could promise to love me for ever. I mean, it sounds like a lovely day, but I go to red carpet events all the time and I'm the centre of attention so it's not like I'm looking for that!","My mum was never strict. I was allowed to go out to clubs underage, watch TV, listen to whatever music I wanted to, and that made me not rebel. I have never touched a drug in my life.","I'm into wellbeing, not because of social pressures to look a certain way, but because I'm interested in living a long, full and healthy life.","I think TV is all about not turning off the public, it's about not being too sexy, not being too much of anything really.","I think the more mediocre you are the better you do because people need to think you're their friend, they don't want to be threatened by you, you've got to be warm, you've got to be not too smart, not too pretty, not too anything.","I've loved acting and dancing since I was a kid. Before anyone thought I was pretty or before I had a voluptuous figure, that was what I was going to do.","I feel a lot more comfortable on stage in the theatre. It just reminds me of being a kid and doing pantomimes.","In this country we're just obsessed with making people celebrities before they've even done anything, which I think is just shocking.","I don't want to make the same mistakes of being swept along with things, taking on jobs that I'm not passionate about, that I don't really believe in but that everyone says I should do.","I am a light person. I think of myself with a shield, a protective shield around me. And I think of bad things bouncing off it. Boom, boom, boom, ba-boom, ba- boom!","Women in the 1950s were so much sexier. That's what I aspire to look like.","Sex keeps me fit and healthy. What can be better than that? It's not about crazy diets or gym workouts.","It makes my skin crawl to think about the violent ways snakes, lizards, alligators and other exotic creatures are raised and killed for boots, bags and belts.","I regard myself as an actress but, obviously, not in the Dame Judi Dench league. That isn't a problem because I don't think we are ever likely to be up for the same part!","I've always wanted to be independent and answer for myself. That probably is the part of me I would class to be feminist. I'd like to have children; marriage I have a bit of an issue with.","I remember when I got to 16, my mum was like, 'No, now you've got to go and get a proper job. We've indulged you long enough.' I don't think they ever thought I was going to be successful in entertainment at all.","I've always paid my own way, I've never lived off anyone."],"Kelly Carlson":["I just love coming to Vegas. There is always a good energy here; the minute you get off the plane, it is happy. Every experience I have had here is fun, and everyone is in a good mood; they are happy, and they let it go. I like that. It is refreshing to me.","I take really good care of myself. I work out a lot and I eat very well.","I am a very good driver - a defensive driver.","I was a wild child. It's nice, though, now to have grown up and be normal and domestic. I've become very traditional. Conservative, worldly and very wise but fun.","'Nip/Tuck' did make me very comfortable in my own skin, no pun intended. I had to be stripped down a lot, and you're kind of in front of the whole world, and it teaches you to accept yourself and be comfortable with yourself real quickly."],"Kelly Clarkson":["God will never give you anything you can't handle, so don't stress.","My friends and family are my support system. They tell me what I need to hear, not what I want to hear and they are there for me in the good and bad times. Without them I have no idea where I would be and I know that their love for me is what's keeping my head above the water.","I'm cute - and God I hate that. Because that's not cool. I'm like your niece, and nobody wants to date their niece. It's the chubby cheeks. The whole reason people voted for me on American Idol is because I'm an everyday, normal girl.","I've never been more nervous in my life than singing the national anthem at the Super Bowl.","I never said I was a 'good girl.' I'm not a bad girl.","The thing I love most about going on vacation is that I get to leave behind any kind of schedule. My entire life is scheduled from morning to night, and when I'm on vacation, there is no schedule.","I put on the Hank Williams and the Patsy Cline and the Rosemary Clooney on vinyl - I'm not trying to be some cool indie-rock person, I just love the way it sounds - and throw on a T-shirt and jeans. In Texas, we practically come out of the womb in jeans.","I'm a hygiene freak. I'm like obsessive-compulsive when it comes to washing your hands.","I would not be a good mother. I mean, I love being an aunt to my niece and nephew. And I used to want to, like, adopt 10 kids - because I had friends who were adopted, and I thought that was the coolest thing, to be chosen. But again, my job is too selfish.","I'm actually not a big fan of the word hope. I think it's a depressing word. I don't want to hope - I want to know. Like I don't hope there's a God, I know there's a God.","Everyone says I'm like the girl next door... Y'all must have really weird neighbors!","There is no greater feeling than hanging out with my dogs, or just walking around the land with our horses. My rescue ranch is is where I feel the most at peace and where I'm reminded of the simple things in life and let the chaos of my crazy work life fade away.","People keep asking me if I am having more fun, being blonde, but I always have fun! Whether I'm blonde, redhead, or brunette! I always have fun.","My winning is getting to perform. That's my victory.","The question I love to get asked is: 'What's the hardest part of your job?' And literally, the answer is probably real sad, but it's to just to be me. Like, it's really hard, because I think people, you know, have a set idea of what a pop star should be.","I love Twitter! At first I made fun of it, because it is very narcissistic, and there's already so much narcissism flowing in this industry, I was like, 'Really, one more?' So I was against it at first. But I really love the idea of the direct connection - there's no middle man muddling it up.","I sing songs that I have lived or I write them because I have lived them. I think the believability factor is key.","I'm always going to live in Texas. Texas is my home - it'll be my home forever.","When people talk about my weight, I'm like, 'You seem to have a problem with it; I don't.'","I love healthy stuff and junk an equal amount. Whatever I'm craving, I go for it. I'm never trying to lose weight - or gain it. I'm just being.","Two must-haves for me are a great book and my iPod.","The thing about Christmas is that it almost doesn't matter what mood you're in or what kind of a year you've had - it's a fresh start.","My whole point is like, well, if I'm the pop star, then it should be whatever I am. There's, you know, room for Katy Perrys and Adeles and Rihannas and Lady Gagas and Ke$has and me and Pinks. I think what's great about all of us is that we represent something different.","The hardest thing about being in this business is just being able to be yourself. People act like there's this one set of rules to follow to be a pop star and I think, 'Well, you say I'm a pop star, so maybe that's not true.'","If I can wake up everyday before I die and know that I don't have to serve anyone food or drinks, I will be happy!","Like every other girl in the world, my most embarrassing moment had to do with a guy completely turning me down. His loss!","Who are you wearing? Who are you wearing?","Oh, there's all these rumors that I'm a lesbian. I have a boyfriend now, Brandon Blackstock; my manager Narvel's son, Reba McEntire's stepson.","No matter what size I am I love performing no matter how big or little I am! I feel good.","I'm so happy now. I love that I'm in a relationship right now... I want a life... The past five years or so I've found my groove and my balance.","I do cardio. I run. I strength-train using my own body weight. I don't like free weights, because I build muscle easily.","Really, what I try to instill in my fans is to be healthy and happy. I have no desire to be super-skinny.","I just had my 30th birthday and we went turkey shooting. It's what I wanted to do, so we went.","Even though I'm a pop singer, I really have more the life of a country singer.","I just blow-dry my hair and put on mascara and lip gloss, and I'm ready to go. I really don't get long nails. They're so Edward Scissorhands.","My happy weight changes. Sometimes I eat more; sometimes I play more. I'll be different sizes all the time.","I love my body. I'm very much OK with it. I don't think artists are ever the ones who have the problem with their weight, it is other people.","I live on a ranch in Texas and do my own thing. And I don't care what anyone has to say about it. My joke is that the only people I'm trying to please are myself and my fans, because they're the ones buying my records. And I have the best, most loyal fan base ever.","I've dated a couple of guys who were awesome, and the celebrity part of my life and the traveling part are hard to get around. You never get to see each other, especially if you're both musicians.","I have a big fear of change, or negative change, anyway. I'm basically the same person I was when I won 'Idol,' or when I was 10.","When I'm picking songs for an album I always want a song that I can relate to and that I have experienced. There's nothing worse than watching an artist try and sell a song that isn't believable coming from them.","I am just like my mother. She raised me to love and take care of animals, especially the ones that need it the most and so I started Eddie's Rescue Ranch. We take in animals that need extra care and attention and the animals that get left behind.","I sound the same regardless if I'm 20 pounds heavier or 20 pounds light, and I think that's the key thing with my fans and why they continue to be loyal because I'm that type of person.","Honestly, I just think we all have special gifts, everyone. You know, obviously, some are more noticeable than others and that's why there's the limelight. Everybody's in it.","I've always been about less government.","I think one thing you could probably say for all my albums is that they're all pretty eclectic pop. There's always a little bit of urban influence, some dance, a little bit of country, singer-songwriter, pop-rock. I like everything! On every album you can find that.","I'm the perfect amount of guarded. I don't reveal too much, and I never reveal who the songs are about. They are real life. People get that. I date a lot of musicians and they do the same thing. People that work with me - who I write about too - they get it. It's my creative outlet, my therapy.","I've got a song on One Direction's album called 'Tell Me A Lie'. It's a really cute song - I love it. I loved that they liked it. They sound really great on it. I already have it - I'm so VIP with my copy on my computer! It does sound really good.","I try not to date musicians. It's all I've dated. Every guy I've dated is a musician. Obviously, it's not working.","Everybody always says that I'm the girl next door, which makes me think that y'all must have a lot of weird next-door neighbours.","I'm very friendly or whatever, but I would hardly say that I'm that cookie-cutter. I don't live in L.A. or New York. I live in Texas, and I go to hole-in-the-wall bars, so there's no paparazzi there.","I love dressing up and doing the red carpet every once in a while, but I am very much a jeans kinda girl, so it's all a little embarrassing for me.","I'm proud of everything I achieved with 'Idol,' and away from 'Idol' also. It's just such a different show now to what it was when I was on it. I didn't even know it was a TV show until the third audition.","When I went to Los Angeles right after high school, I got some acting jobs, and I never, ever wanted to be an actress! Public speaking and acting make me want to vomit. But I have never been nervous singing. When it comes to public speaking, I stumble on my words, sweat, and pull at my clothes.","Even though I hate acting, I love doing videos for my songs.","I've loved my 20s, but I would never repeat them.","I still watch 'Idol,' and it's still the No. 1 show, so obviously I'm not the only one who loves to sit at home and be entertained.","I don't really exude that 'it' factor.","I'm loyal and I think most Texans are very loyal, but I'm also stubborn.","I'm from a small town so, like, everyone's married with children or about to have children. So it's a little hard when you go home and people are like - and that's why people think I'm gay - because they're like 'Why aren't you married?' And I'm like, 'it doesn't happen for everyone right off the bat.'"],"Kelly Corrigan":["It's funny, I'd rather be known as a writer who crafted a really nice piece about women's friendships over time. But that doesn't roll off the tongue like 'YouTube sensation.'","Growing up, I saw my mother cry exactly once. The morning of her brother's funeral. One long tear ran down her cheek through her make up until she caught it near her mouth and patted it dry with a tissue she pulled from inside her sleeve.","I moved from Philadelphia to California when I was 25, after traveling abroad for a year. I thought I'd come home eventually and settle down, but I didn't.","It's clear to you immediately that you can have anything you want when you have cancer.","Shortly before I turned 37 and my older daughter turned 3, I was diagnosed with breast cancer: stage III of IV.","I almost threw up the first time I set foot inside the University of California, San Francisco's Comprehensive Care Center and joined the stream of thin, slow-moving, low-voiced, gray-skinned people. I didn't want to be one of the pitied, the struck-down.","Cancer is a growth hormone for empathy, and empathy makes us useful to each other in ways we were not, could not have been, before.","I am an average mother in almost every way, so yes, much to my regret, I do yell at my children.","Moms in fiction and memoir get a bad rap.","The truth is, I'd like to be closer to my kids. I'd like to share more with them. But that's not what this time in their lives is about. This is their time to separate, to self-direct, to become independent."],"Kelly Cutrone":["Society has a hyper emphasis on thin, and that trend comes from the consumers - it does not come from the fashion industry. The fashion industry needs to make money; that's what we do. If people said, 'We want a 300 pound purple person,' the first industry to do it would be fashion.","There are a bunch of different ways to look at the fashion industry. Is it shallow to work in fashion? Yes, it can be. But does fashion transform a woman who might feel like nothing and unimportant to glamorous and gorgeous? Yes, it does. Does it employ a huge sector of America? Yes, it does.","People should just express themselves and not worry about trends - try to use fashion like a compass, an indicator, examples of things that you can be. It's not to be taken so seriously. It's just clothes.","Baby-carrying means your hearts are close together. It's a very intense and beautiful way to bond with your baby, very intimate. It's also easier than a stroller.","I had the most expensive haircut you can get, and I was walking around with my hair in rollers backstage, and my hair still came out looking like I was shot out of a cannon and I had just gotten out of bed.","People want to express themselves - that's what fashion is for. You can go to Target and get something that Rodarte designed for $34, but would you want to go buy the higher version for $3,400? I think most people would say no.","Before turning 32 is an amazing time to do radical things. You figure out who you are while you figure out who you are not.","Single motherhood is an amazing thing; it's a blessing.","I don't have time to write a mom blog, but I'm not against it. I think it's great when women talk about things. I'm all about female empowerment. There's a lot of lonely, lost moms out there. Moms need to be encouraged to tell the truth. There's a lot of glamour mommy stuff. It's OK to get real.","Most fashion models do not look good in bikinis because they're too thin.","If you're 5' 6\", just stay home. Don't pretend you're 5' 8\" or 5' 9\". If you want to be a beauty model, I guess that's fine, you can do glamour, but you're not going to do runway. If you're over 29 - 26, even - I would suggest you work regionally and not try to work nationally.","We see women who go out and want to look like Jennifer Aniston, and they're wearing an ill-fitting red dress and ugly gold shoes, and they've got flat hair and they can't walk.","I don't take it lightly that I brought a life into this world. They're waiting for you every day, these sweet little angels. You have to have time for them to interact on a daily basis.","If we get a girl who is bigger than a 4, she is not going to fit the clothes. Clothes look better on thin people. The fabric hangs better.","If people decide thin is out, the fashion industry won't have thin models anymore. Have you spent time with fashion people? They are ruthless. They want money. And the one thing they know is people want clothes to cover their bodies. Unfortunately, most people aren't comfortable with their bodies."],"Kelly Evans":["Not enough children being vaccinated against measles, mumps, and rubella because their parents, for whatever reason, have decided that it is voluntary.","I shut down social media because I needed to shut out online distractions and engage with the people, issues, and work right in front of me.","Typically in a panic, corporate bonds sell off as investors fear weaker growth, tighter financial conditions, or need liquidity.","Price is what you pay, but value, as Warren Buffett has observed, is what you get.","Betting that markets will be 'volatile' is like betting the weather will be partly cloudy. It's a smart-sounding strategy that doesn't mean much.","Too often, the public can fall into the trap of investing when stock prices are rising, not dropping.","Fans of the hit HGTV show 'Fixer Upper' are well aware that its stars, Chip and Joanna Gaines, live on a farm in Waco, Texas. Nearly every episode features some kind of montage of their four kids romping outside with various kinds of farm animals, from pigs to horses to goats.","In his new autobiography, 'Capital Gaines,' Chip talks about the farm work - and he says he does, in fact, do it himself.","Twitter was actually the holdout in what has turned out to be my total purge of social media.","I had been one of the earliest social media adopters, driven by a mix of curiosity and enthusiasm for the way in which it levels borders and connects people who couldn't really have connected otherwise.","I felt lost in endless spools of social media. All the while, emails by the thousands were piling up, phone calls were getting lost in the mix, and messages from the most important people in my life were getting drowned out in the din. I was more responsive to comments on Instagram than to my own closest friends and family.","If Warren Buffett could change his mind about investing in airlines, Mohnish Pabrai could change his mind about investing in autos. Pabrai, who has modeled his investment career and fee structure after Buffett's original partnership, counts General Motors, Fiat Chrysler, and Ferrari in his highly concentrated portfolio.","The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average has closed higher in 17 of the 21 sessions since Donald Trump was elected president, with about a dozen record closes so far as it continues marching higher.","Strong credit markets give companies borrowing options to boost their stock prices while making bearish investors scramble to close out trades before losing any more money, both of which then push the stock market even higher and continue the self-reinforcing bullish cycle.","The billionaire founder of investment firm Elliott Management was one of several investors who warned financial ministers in 2007 that a crack in the housing market could cause huge problems for the banking industry.","Britain's FTSE 100 stock index has not just recovered from its post-vote low close below 6,000. It has surged to close at nearly 6,600. That's its highest closing value yet of 2016, and within reach of its all-time highs.","A cheaper British currency could be a crisis if its swift move provoked a broader financial crisis, which it has not, or if it triggered massive inflation. For now, cheaper sterling will hurt some British households and enterprises while being a boon for others.","The Bank of England's Carney is worried the shock of Britain's vote to leave the E.U. could cause households and businesses to temporarily halt spending, which could stop the economy and even spur a recession.","If 'Brexit' really is a political crisis, it should be treated as a political crisis - and not, despite all the market upheaval, a financial or economic one.","CEOs are also chief capital allocators. This is a point Warren Buffett has repeatedly made: that the role management plays in allocating capital across businesses and boosting returns on that capital is a critical yet poorly recognized one.","There is surprisingly low penetration still of synthetic rubber gloves in the medical field. People are allergic to natural rubber, but the industry has been slow to switch to synthetic gloves.","There are two ways to approach the market. You can guess which direction prices will go in next, or you can figure out what businesses and their securities are really worth.","Entire populations of market strategists, fund managers, and economists are employed to try and intuit for clients which securities to bet on for the best possible return each year - or quarter.","Listen to market strategists, and a word that comes up a lot these days is 'volatility.'","The collapse of the housing bubble sent the world spiraling into recession. The collapse of the energy and commodity bubble threatens to be just as damaging.","China has been on a historic commodities binge as it doubled the size of its economy in recent years to become one of the world's largest. Even so, those fundamentals begat - as they have so often throughout human history - a feeding frenzy.","Russia's leader, Vladimir Putin, has managed to retain high approval ratings despite his slumping economy by seizing Crimea from Ukraine and participating in the Syrian war that is destabilizing the Mideast and, increasingly, Europe and the West.","A 'reptilian revolution' has the potential to reshape manufacturing. The 'snakebots' being developed at Carnegie Mellon University aren't just useful for surgical or search-and-rescue purposes. They could also usher in a new, more customized era of mass production.","The 'snakebot', which is a type of mechanized, biologically inspired robot, itself has roots in Japanese laboratories of the 1970s. What the team at Pittsburgh-based Carnegie Mellon is doing today under professor Howie Choset is making the 'snakebots' stronger, smaller, and more maneuverable than ever."],"Kelly Hu":["When I was young, my mother would not let me get my ears pierced because I used to get into too many fights.","I've managed to keep my clothes on for everything I've done so far.","You'd think that I'd be dieting, but I'm not.","I'm looking forward to working with some of the best cast and crew there are.","I've always wanted to be Wonder Woman, of course. She had the greatest costume.","Well, they had to have me in the G-string because this is PG-13, right?","I wasn't sure what I was getting into when I signed on to work with a wrestler.","I can pretty much get in touch with my evil side pretty easily.","It's fun being able to suit up and go and kick butt and not have to worry about memorizing dialogue. It's a whole different way of acting because you're not depending on the words at all, you're really depending on everything else that you have.","I have such a big mouth.","With the fight scenes, they would take a video camera and shoot alongside the camera so we would piece it together on the computer and had an extremely rough cut of what we were doing.","I guess I'm still sort of feisty and a little bit of a tomboy.","There weren't a lot of action roles growing up - there were a few, maybe, like Wonder Woman, but then it wasn't real action.","I always loved the idea of learning martial arts, but it wasn't until I was in my 20s that I really started doing it and taking up karate.","Being Asian where you're supposed to be more quiet and softer and I was always getting reprimanded for laughing to loud or speaking to loudly.","I'm also taking singing classes as well, not that I ever plan to sing in public in my entire life. I actually have a phobia of singing, so I decided to take some singing lessons to help me get away from the phobia.","I also have some Chinese weapons, but I like the Japanese sword the best.","When you do voiceover it's such a fun job to be able to do. First of all, you can do it in your pajamas and you don't have to get dressed up for it.","I never play video games! I'm so bad at it. I have, like, no manual dexterity.","I can kick your head off, but I can't, like, play a stupid little video game.","The comic book fans, especially 'X-Men' fans, are so serious about their comic book."],"Kelly Jones":["I'm not a betting man.","A performance is only as good as the audience you are playing to. A lot of times you feed off of the audience, and we always try to give them all we've got and sometimes you don't get a lot back, but we've never been dead whenever we've performed.","Japan is quite weird because they wait for you to say something before they respond. You can literally hear a pin drop, they don't make a sound until you say something to the crowd.","I don't have a special place or ritual for writing songs, basically I write songs whenever an idea hits me, in my hotel room, on the road, in the plane.","I like to open for a band as it brings on sort of a challenge and it makes things more interesting. It reminds me of when we were just starting out because we would open for other bands in the beginning.","We didn't really want to be an overnight success as that brings with it its own problems.","Avril Lavigne sold a massive amount of albums and she has to top that with her next release. We have four great albums behind us, and it's not going to be as hard to live up to that.","When you are on tour in the UK it takes a few hours to get anywhere. A lot of the time you can have a beer, close your eyes for two minutes, and then you are there. In the U.S. it is much more like a road trip as all the cities are so spread apart.","Revising a screenplay is much more frustrating than revising a song because you have to read through the entire work again while you are changing stuff. It is a lot easier to edit a song.","The song Dakota was first written in Paris. I was doing a promo trip. It was snowing and the hotel room was really cold and boring and for some reason I just had a go of the guitar and the song came pretty quick.","Big shows are more like events and small shows are more like traditional gigs.","The story behind every song is individual to itself.","It's better for the listener to interpret their own meanings to the music.","Like all bands, the first two albums are always the ones most written about, and the most covered. When a band gets to their third of fourth album, the story of the band has already been told.","To remain relevant though, I think making great records is the key.","The press will naturally come and go as it has done with all artists, from David Bowie to Neil Young to U2.","Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman came to see our show, We all had a drink before they set off on their travels, and we kept in touch.","I heard the Bloc Party record Japan before it came out in the UK as they are on the V2 record label. I think it has a great vibe and has great songs. I also think the Kings of Leon are right up my street.","We changed every lead in our whole system, and to this day we still don't really know why it did it. We think wires were touching and faulting. That was it really, but it didn't make it any easier.","The Millennium Stadium thing was for the Tsunami concert. It was a thing that I think every band in the country would have liked to be a part of at the time that it happened.","When I first knew I was having children, I thought I wanted boys, but then I thought I'd be better with girls. I'm quite sensitive, and you get more cuddles with girls. And they like their dads.","Whether I'm telling stories in songs or if directing is the next step, being a storyteller is what I like doing."],"Kelly LeBrock":["I could be like everyone else and stop eating, but that wouldn't make me happy.","You're at the mercy of the editors' hands.","If you can't be with yourself, you'll never learn to be with anyone else.","Don't hate me because I'm beautiful.","My children are my whole life.","Love has many faces.","I've dated jerks, so why not geeks?","Success for me its to raise happy, healthy human beings.","As long as my husband's looking at me, that's all I care about!"],"Kelly Lynch":["You know, I change my hair color a lot, I do all sorts of different things.","I just think we're living in a time of massive, amazing change, like the Industrial Revolution on acid.","It's part of the fun of it to work with strong personalities.","I've been overwhelmed; I was a single mother for a time.","I think right now in the world we're feeling like there's no solid ground beneath our feet, you know?","My whole career is based on taking a left turn after each film and doing the opposite of what I've just done.","I don't care what people's myths are about me.","The worst thing would be for them to find out who I really am, because that's where I hide.","That's where I got my start and where I'll continue to work, but I can't tell you the number of films between Drugstore Cowboy and Curly Sue that I auditioned for and wanted that didn't choose me.","But actors at a certain point take the best of what's available to them.","And sometimes I do films so my daughter can see me work.","I make a good living and I've never looked at myself as being an artiste.","The fact that I got Drugstore Cowboy at all was a fluke.","The least consideration of any film I've ever worked on is who is right for it.","You look at Gone With the Wind, how right Vivian Leigh was for that. Don't know if that would happen today.","It's important for me to see as many colors in the character as possible.","I like to show as much of a woman as I can. I like to fill things out.","If it's independent, it's because I love it... 'cause they usually end up costing me money to do.","Well, for someone who looks like me you wonder where Alfred Hitchcock is.","In a collaborative environment directors hire actors because they want their input, not just their bodies.","I do come shackled with whatever people think I am.","Most movie stars don't change their look at all.","Cause I won't repeat myself, the way I dress and look.","Well, I'm a consumer as well. I go to the movies with my popcorn and believe everything I see.","Yeah, I do feel badly sometimes, not for whose coming up and getting roles I'm not right for anymore but the people I compete with, who range from Uma Thurman on up.","I mean, I always feel incredibly lucky to get a job.","In their 30s women really start to live... they're not children anymore, and they're not just mothers.","I can't wait til I get the chance to be a character and how my face looks isn't the first consideration.","My idols are all older.","You learn your text and have it in the back of your head, without a thought as to how you're going to say it.","All I really want to do is entertain people out there sitting in the dark and for them to believe it."],"Kelly Macdonald":["Being a parent is such a difficult business; you don't always get things right. And also, you don't want to be a perfect parent... You need people to be human, and part of it is imperfection.","They're naughty, all those writers - they mess around with people. I know James Gandolfini got a bit fed up on 'The Sopranos': if he said anything in front of a writer, told them a story from his life, it could make its way into the script.","I get claustrophobic in a harness. I'd be a terrible superhero.","Most of my memories are the sound of rain on caravan roofs.","People don't change very much, and the things life ends up being about don't change from generation to generation. Life is about love. And people's stories don't really change. Your environment changes dramatically, technology changes, but people don't change, in the way our minds work.","A few years ago, if you had told me I'd be moving back to Glasgow I'd have said, 'No way'. But it's changed. It's much more vibrant, bohemian. But I'm 35 and I've become a bit of a homebody, I don't really go out much. Same in New York. My home could be anywhere but I love Glasgow.","I've done TV and I've done film, and I'm not snobby about it. It's about the project.","L.A. is brilliant, but however long my trip is I'm always ready to leave. But New York I'm never quite happy to see the back of.","I don't lobby where work is concerned. As long as I know I've got something coming up, I don't really worry. It's not that I'm not ambitious, but I don't have a drive to be hugely successful and be working all the time.","What I'm normally associated with are darker, more brooding roles.","I love that thing on Amazon that you can go on and order a book, and you click on it and it says, 'You might also like,' or 'Other people who bought this have bought that.'","I'm no good at anecdotes.","It was both comforting and terrifying to go in to audition for 'The Girl in the Cafe,' as I'd worked with everyone in the room on 'State Of Play.'","It can get a bit boring working on accents.","It's that TV thing. You can be in the biggest film of the year and it will still not have the kind of impact a TV series has. Once you're in people's living rooms, that's it. There's no hiding place.","I tend to get cast as a certain type of quiet, almost introverted person who's strong on the inside, but the characters are so very different I don't see it as any kind of typecasting.","I'm so not a celebrity.","Mine wasn't a lakes-and-boats kind of childhood. I grew up on a Glasgow council estate with a single mother. For our holidays, we went to Grandma and Grandad's caravan near Aberfoyle.","I was interested in drama, but it never seemed like a real profession somehow. It was so outside my experience, and I probably wouldn't have had the confidence for drama school, though I did send off for an application form.","The people on programmes like 'Made in Chelsea' just want to be celebrities. It's so depressing. No proper actor has that as a goal. I'm striving for longevity in my career.","It felt like a series of coincidences and luck that I ended up getting the part in 'Trainspotting,' but it's been an incredible journey since then. Every now and then, I sit and really think about it, and it blows my mind. I have to stop because I don't want my brain to implode.","I adore the fact that when I'm driving home from work, as soon as I hit my neighbourhood, I see people I know.","I properly enjoy what I do, but I know it's not brain surgery. I don't take myself too seriously.","I find just being on set embarrassing. Mortifying. And that's with all my clothes on.","I've done a few American accents. I've maybe passed a test. But I don't know if it makes things easier or not.","New Mexico was such a strange place; it was like filming on Mars.","I thought I might not want to act any more after having a baby. It turns out I still enjoy it.","I'm pretty happy with the two cities I call home now - Glasgow and New York. But I'd like to give Paris a shot.","Sometimes I bite off a fingernail to use as a toothpick. Nasty.","I walk away from jobs generally feeling good about it and that I've done a good job. And it's always slightly deflating when I see the film thing because it's still me up there.","Robert Altman was such an incredible person to have the privilege to know and meet and have dinner with.","I loved Winnie the Pooh, the Disney character, and I loved his wit and warmth.","It's really great if people actually want to see something that you've made and you've put a lot of effort into. And that doesn't always happen, and there's not always a rhyme or reason.","I spent pretty much all my wages from 'No Country For Old Men' on a pair of cowboy boots. They're ridiculous. It's like wearing two Christmas trees on my legs.","Watching films I'm in is always a bit odd, especially when I'm watching them for the first time with other people. It's hard not to see my faults.","I've always been pretty self-sufficient. I never had to borrow money from my mum, even in the early days.","When I started acting I knew nothing. It was a momentous decision to pick up the flyer for the 'Trainspotting' audition. 'Destined' is a bit of a poncy word for it, but I do think I was headed in that direction.","I don't think I've been shy in the past. Young and uncomfortable, maybe. But shy? It has become this annoying term that I've been lumbered with.","There was nobody in my family who knew anything about the film industry. I'm from the west of Scotland. It's not exactly a mecca for filmmaking. I think I saw Rab C. Nesbitt in Asda once, but that was about it."],"Kelly Marie Tran":["I feel like I'm always talking about myself, and I love not talking about myself.","I worked in an office. I was like an assistant. So, I would just answer phone calls, coordinate events. It was a great day job. I worked with amazing people, but obviously, whenever you are doing something that's not your dream, you kind of feel like, 'Oh, I'm on this grind.'","My parents are not of this world. I've had to work multiple jobs, been in a position where I cannot pay off student loans.","I knew what it was like growing up in a world where I never saw myself in anything.","I have a great family and great friends, and I think that they'll keep me grounded.","I was working a full-time job but not having anything in my savings account at the end of the month because of my bills and because acting in the beginning costs money.","My parents are refugees from Vietnam, so they didn't grow up with 'Star Wars.' I don't think they know what's going on in the movie at any given time.","Even though 'Star Wars' takes place in another galaxy, a lot of the themes and things that characters deal with in terms of lessons that they're learning are things that are completely relatable to real life.","I think there are many ways to be brave and that being brave and vulnerable in terms of a romantic situation is one of the hardest things to do in real life.","You get the initial script, and then things sort of change here and there, but the whole thing is this sort of mushy collaboration, which I love.","I think, as an actor, you create things for your character that you think will make it more personal to you, because on the day, you want to make sure that you're truly there in the moment.","I never want to forget that I'm doing an impossible thing. How rare is it that you get to be part of something people love? It's really special. It's a very out-of-body experience to be a part of something so huge.","I believe if you can have an open dialogue about anything, whether it's a book or a movie or TV show, it's this door that suddenly opens your mind to new ideas.","Even if someone doesn't like it, or just likes it for me, storytelling has been the one true love story of my entire life.","There are so few times in life where you are passionate about anything. And I think that if you can find that, you should just hold on to it and protect it at all costs and just follow it, because it's so rare.","When I'm driving past the place I used to work, or when I'm driving past the comedy studio where I used to take photos in exchange for classes, or when I'm driving past the yoga studio I used to clean on the weekends - it's not that far removed from me yet. I get very sentimental over things like that.","I still just sort of live my life the way that I was before. I don't know when I will feel that it's different.","Carrie Fisher will always be an icon as Leia, but also as Carrie. She will live on forever.","I feel like 'The Last Jedi' is a lot of things that people aren't going to expect, which I think is a good thing.","I'm one of those people where, if I get a piece of advice from someone I look up to and respect, I'll really listen to it.","I eventually want to write and direct and produce my own stuff.","It never felt like we were making a 'Star Wars' movie. It didn't feel like it was serious. It just felt like we were allowed to be creative and kind of goof off.","I think anytime you go into anything that's different and new, there's a bit of fear.","My dad was a street kid for seven years - he was homeless.","My parents didn't get to have a dream. Their dream was to live in a country where their kids would have choice.","I truly did feel that I owed it to my parents, my grandparents, to do whatever it was that I wanted, because if I wasn't happy, if I wasn't being true to myself, then I wasn't living fully. They had given up so much so that I could live at the level that so many people are just automatically born into.","If I am just, like, on a run by myself, I've never been stopped. Even if I'm at Target buying my own action figure, people would not believe that it's me. I actually was like, 'This is me!'","You know who I was most nervous to meet, probably? Andy Serkis. I am such a huge fan.","Seeing someone dressed up as your character is incredible.","I do feel like my improv training has helped me throughout my entire audition process only because the idea of 'yes and-ing' applies to everything.","I think that Carrie is such an icon, not just as someone who played Princess Leia, but someone who was groundbreaking in that she was OK with being honest - brutally so, unapologetically so.","I actually read 'The Last Jedi' before 'The Force Awakens' came out. It totally helped me, though! The idea of this franchise that I already knew was such a big cultural thing, I was sort of given this freedom to be honest with that character and not have this pressure of making her something else that we had already seen in this universe.","I'm totally pro-porg! I would not eat a porg. They're so cute; you can't eat them. They're friends!","Growing up, I've always felt I was from two different worlds. I was born in the U.S., but my parents were born in Vietnam, and they raised my sisters and I with the parenting methods of the Vietnamese culture.","So much of me is because of what my parents experienced in this country. So much of me is because of the things my parents overcame so that I could have the luxury of having a dream.","My mom works in funerals, and my dad works at Burger King.","You find little ways to keep your mind at peace so that you can, at the end of the day, do the most important thing, which is do a good job.","I think a lot of times, in a lot of modern-day movies, a lot of things are CGI, but so much of the stuff in 'Star Wars' is built and created by these artists.","You search for images and stories and movies and music from people that look like you and sound like you and speak like you because you want to feel like, 'Oh, if they can do it, so can I.' There's a little bit of that need for validation, especially when you're younger and trying to look to someone to look up to.","In terms of the timeline, 'The Force Awakens' came out in December of 2015. I got the role in November of 2015. I was auditioning and waiting to hear back when their marketing machine was everywhere. It's like you're going for something that's so high stakes, and you try to remind yourself, 'Okay, stop thinking about it,' and it's everywhere.","I was not on social media for a really long time because I was afraid of being seen.","So many people don't realise you need to be on a certain level of Maslow's hierarchy to have a dream: you have to have food and be safe from danger, all these things my parents didn't have at the get go, so I, from the very beginning, believe I have been living for multiple generations, for my parents and grandparents.","I want to work with great directors and tell great stories - storytelling is the one great love of my life, and it means so much, and we have the ability to change the world by telling stories, and I want to keep doing that.","I was a food tour guide - I took people on a tour to different restaurants in the area.","'Star Wars' is so much bigger than any single person involved, so you feel like you want to do that justice and also feel like you want to do justice to that little girl inside me that never saw anyone who looked like her, that person who's starving for representation - it's a lot.","I want to work with amazing filmmakers and tell important stories, and if I have to audition to do that, I will.","When you're really young, you tend to fall in love with characters. If you start seeing the same type of character everywhere and realize that they don't look like you, or they don't speak like you, you start wanting to change who you are. That's something that I did when I was a young kid.","A lot of 'Star Wars' fans who are specifically Asian never had a character they could dress up like, or they would, and people would always call them 'Asian Rey' or 'Asian fill-in-the-blank.'","I wish that all different types of people of all races and all upbringings were all equally represented in this industry that influences so many people.","I didn't know there was this sort of immediate camaraderie that's very intense when you make a movie because you're all in this together. You tend to get really close to people really fast."],"Kelly Masterson":["Every good story is about who we are and our struggle to define ourselves.","I am always drawn to father/son stories.","Nelson McCormack on 'Killing Kennedy' was really terrific because I wrote the script, and he had some terrific ideas. We went over the script together, and I was with him on set. So it was a collaborative effort.","I'm not always interested in Hollywood norms and boy-next-door kind of characters.","I wrote a few unsuccessful screenplays before I wrote 'Before the Devil Knows You're Dead.' I wrote them as television plays that never got made. I'm glad I wrote them - I think it was a good experience.","Stage is so important because it teaches me how to convey character with words - how to convey how a character reacts by the way they appear on stage. I can usually tell a playwright from someone who has never written for the stage. Did the character work? Did the dialogue reveal who the character is?","I'm not well-versed in the science fiction world. I'm hoping that I'll get more opportunities in it because you get to create a new world.","Actors are such wonderful creatures and such wonderful instruments. It's always different on the page or in my head. I hear it differently. I see it differently. And then, you give it to an actor, and it comes alive in a way that you didn't expect.","The work I did on 'Killing Kennedy' was very meticulous and, in some ways, actually tedious. It was hard work because there is so much known about John F. Kennedy and Lee Harvey Oswald. To try to distill that into a clear narrative that's interesting and tells two great stories was a real challenge.","I came to success very late in life.","As a writer, I'm limitless.","'Snowpiercer' was out of this world. It gave me a chance to do something I'd never done before, to create a whole new world.","The thrill of doing 'Good People' is I love those kinds of stories, and I'm good at them, and it's wonderful to see that material given to a terrific director and a terrific cast.","None of my movies have ever made any money, so it's not about commercial success for me. It's always the same thing. I want to create something valuable, something unusual and different that the world has never seen.","Success, to me, is something new and vibrant.","I think of events like the Challenger and 9/11 - events that move us so much that we never quite get over them. So it's important to go back and relive those feelings in order to remember how important those events were to us.","I had written for the theater and didn't know that I knew how to write for film. Ultimately, I think it's just trusting your voice, trusting your characters, and then telling them in a different medium.","I will tell you that I'm a bit of a snob. I love film, and I would like to work in film, and I'm disappointed that indie film is as hard as it is to work in now. It's hard to get things done, but that sort of work is being done on TV. That's what I do; that's what I write. It's what I love, and hopefully, that's what my future's going to be.","All my work is always that exploration of human nature."],"Kelly McCreary":["It's really hard for me to memorize the medical jargon if I don't know the meaning of every single word. So I do have to do a little Wikipedia/YouTube research to figure out what I'm talking about.","I would say I have a bit of a nerd vibe.","I love an acting challenge, and I love getting to sit down with my script and do all my drama work.","Acting is a job you can learn a lot in. You get to play lots of different characters with different professions and different backgrounds; they come from different places than you do, so it's really fun when you're immersing yourself in that world of that person to learn about how other people's lives are.","At first, being a storyteller, it was fun to dress up and fun to sing songs and pretend to be very dramatic - all of that stuff was just fun early on.","I want to be part of the storytelling that educates people and awakens a sense of compassion in other people of the kind of people they don't encounter in their daily lives very frequently.","I came to L.A. for pilot season, and it was so brutal. So brutal. But still, I just want to be making forward progress. There's lots of ideas about being a superstar. But my idea of being a superstar is just going forward and having new challenges and trying out new things.","I didn't see a lot of women who looked like me on TV when I was growing up.","Entertainment is one of America's greatest exports. And the stories that we tell about people inform the world about how to think about people.","The more normal it gets for people to see people of a gender or skin tone they wouldn't expect in jobs that they wouldn't expect, or speaking a way they wouldn't expect them to, the more it cultivates a sense that we share more than separates us."],"Kelly McGillis":["Life is a journey and it's about growing and changing and coming to terms with who and what you are and loving who and what you are.","By not coming forward (about rape), you make yourself a victim forever.","Love isn't intellectual - it's visceral.","I have not had a drink for four years, which for me is a long time.","I am not drinking now but I cannot guarantee tomorrow.","Tom and I didn't have a problem with the height differential but Paramount did, so we tried to hide it.","To me, acting is acting... I'd be happy working on a street corner in a mime troupe.","I think it's sad that movies and television have caused the theatre to fade as a popular art form. I hope to get young people into the theatre and expose them to Shakespeare.","For a long time I thought I could deal with my anger and hostility on my own. But I couldn't. I denied that it had affected me, and yet I was so frantic on the inside with other people: I needed to be constantly reassured."],"Kelly Miller":["I see that the path of progress has never taken a straight line, but has always been a zigzag course amid the conflicting forces of right and wrong, truth and error, justice and injustice, cruelty and mercy.","Moreover, broad plans commensurate with our national purpose and resources would bring conviction of our power to every soldier in the front line, to the nations associated with us in the war, and to the enemy.","The eventual place the American army should take on the western front was to a large extent influenced by the vital question of communication and supply.","No American can read the story of the part America took in the war without experiencing a glow of patriotic feeling. Every Allied nation can say the same thing.","For a century after the reign of Frederick, Prussia remained the most prominent Germanic state in Europe.","Germany expected that at the most a day or so would see Belgian resistance broken and the dash on Paris begun. It was not safe to start such a forward rush with Belgium unconquered.","Having achieved such signal successes in the east, Russia and Roumania being both disposed of, the German leaders planned a campaign designed to crush Italy.","In 1917 - as we have seen, - Italy suffered a great reverse, losing 200,000 soldiers and immense supplies.","In the early days of his reign, Bismarck confided to a friend that it would some day be necessary for Germany to confine William II in an insane asylum.","Kara Braxton, she's a great player, so I think they can go far this year.","The collapse of Russia was the second great event of 1917.","The Engineer Corps is charged with all construction, including light railways and roads.","The French were generous in giving us assistance in corps and army artillery, with its personnel, and we were confident from the start of our superiority over the enemy in guns of all calibers.","The success of the Allies in the west was in a measure offset by Teutonic victories in the east. When the invasion of Belgium began, Russia made immediate efforts to counteract by invasion of East Prussia.","The year 1915 was one of meager results, the advantages remaining on the side of the Central Powers, with this understanding, however: The Allies were growing stronger because Great Britain was making rapid progress in marshaling her resources for war.","To meet the shortage of supplies from America, due to lack of shipping, the representatives of the different supply departments were constantly in search of available material and supplies in Europe.","When the armistice was declared American forces had fought their way to Sedan.","With Germany herself falling, it is not strange that the nations leagued with her also went down to defeat."],"Kelly Olynyk":["I grew six, seven inches in junior year of high school, so I played guard my whole life growing up. So I think there's where I got my skill set from.","You see a lot of European influence coming in with bigger guys having a larger skill set, shoot the ball, handle the ball, pass the ball. I'm hoping that'll develop into something I can do.","I'm trying to take all the media attention with a grain of salt. It is nice, but you are never as great as people say you are. And you're never as bad as others say you are."],"Kelly Osbourne":["I say find one true friend to help you get through the tough times.","I was called fat and ugly in the press almost my entire life. I understand that being judged by others comes with the territory, but it broke my heart and ruined my self-esteem.","They say you should never eat before you go to bed, but I've found just having a tiny little snack - like half an apple or something like that - before you go to sleep really helps.","I never thought in a million years I'd be that healthy girl who wakes up every morning to exercise. After being called 'cherubic and chubby,' I'm rocking a bikini!","I just think you would never kill and cut up a human to wear so why do it to animals? I just think it's horrible, I would never wear fur, although I guess if it was a really vintage piece you might just get away with it.","I guess I have friends around me but when you're paying them can they ever really be true friends?","I was dating this guy and we would spend all day text messaging each other. And he thought that he could tell that he liked me more because he actually spelt the word 'YOU' and I just put the letter 'U'.","I'd be the best mum ever. I would. I've got great training from my mum.","Pilates is amazing, my posture is so much better and I'm even starting to get muscles on my tummy - it's incredible.","I'm an emotional eater. When I get upset, my diet goes out the window.","I've done a lot of growing up since the age of 16 and I really wanted that to be reflected in my music.","I hate the word gothic but I would like to try doing something like that. A gothic sound, not rock, but gothic. There's a difference.","They are the only people in the world who I can truly trust and rely on. Touring gets really lonely. I guess I have friends around me but when you're paying them can they ever really be true friends?","It's funny that all these goths paint their faces with such white make-up and that is the actual colour of my skin, I am that pale!","I think my mum has the foulest mouth of anyone I've ever met.","Oh that's very English, that's probably why. They just go 'LOL' in America.","My girlfriends and I just started doing plyometrics. It's a killer - it hurts so much. But when you walk out of there, you're like, 'I can't believe I just did that and my body looks this good.'","To fill the shoes of rock 'n' roll, because of the family I have, is a really hard thing.","I feel good in my own skin because I've accepted the fact that I'm me. That's what's so great about being alive and being on this planet: Everybody's different.","I don't really like wearing bikinis. And if you don't either, don't make yourself.","Sometimes it's other people's voices you have to shut out.","Women are so unforgiving of themselves. We don't recognize our own beauty because we're too busy comparing ourselves to other people.","I've completely changed the way I eat since doing 'Dancing With The Stars.'","A trick I've learned is to eat just a little bit of something that has no carbs and no sugar in it before you go to sleep because it keeps your metabolism going.","I go on the Internet and look at old pictures of myself, because it is the best reminder of how far I have come and where I do not want to be.","I didn't know that anything was wrong with me until the media got involved in my life.","To wake up in England and have the newspaper on your front door with a headline that says, 'Ozzie's Beach Whale of a Daughter,' doesn't really do much for your self-esteem at all.","I can't lie, I did a lot of really, really stupid things, and it was because it was my way of crying for help.","It's so easy for me to fall back into depression. I think it comes with having money. I don't have to work. I could be sitting bored and depressed at home with a bag on my head.","Touring gets really lonely.","I call myself a FFP: former fat person, and when you're an FFP, you will always see in yourself what people used to bully you for.","Even now I don't consider myself skinny, but I have put a lot of hard work into my body over the years, and in the process, I've really learned to love myself."],"Kelly Overton":["Working with real wolves has been exhilarating. They're so amazing. They're these beautiful, brilliant animals and they're great to work with.","Being a mom kind of grounded me in a way. Your body takes on a whole new meaning."],"Kelly Preston":["I would like to end world hunger and create world peace, stop corruption, stop drugs getting to kids.","I was actually lost in Beirut on the way home.","I think by being happy it actually affects the way that you look too.","We have freedoms and boundaries; we just have a great family life.","I grew up in Hawaii so I was outside a lot playing in the water.","I grew up in Hawaii and I think it was easier because we did not have cliques at high school.","I took a long time off to have my baby and spend time with my family.","I didn't see a ton of movies growing up.","I have a wonderful marriage and two great kids.","I love being a scientologist, as it's helped me in every single aspect of my life.","The premieres are, kind of exciting, especially to Ella, who loves limousines.","I thought it was such a unique concept to play parents who happen to be super heroes and have a son who is going through puberty and starting high school.","I like to spend my time with my children.","I was a gymnast for years.","The easiest gift to give my husband is anything to do with airlines and flying.","We are all trying to balance our careers and children and give as much of ourselves and our time to them. You work and have a husband, and projects, and friends. It is a balancing act.","So I delegate a lot and I make my family come first, my husband and our kids.","Keeping it all normal and keeping us together is my first priority. Then I fit films into my life.","My big places to shop are Wal-Mart and Target - seriously. That is where half of my stuff comes from now.","I don't get to go to the super fancy stores unless I am in L.A. so you stay pretty real and normal that way.","Our friends have nothing to do with the business. Some of our closest friends in Florida are not stars.","You want to spend time with your children even though you are tired so you do all those things.","We moved to Australia for two years though and that was a little bit tough trying to fit in.","I support anything to do with the welfare and rights of children in a huge way.","They are amazing kids so we let them make decisions but also have discipline."],"Kelly Price":["There was no person, whether they thought I was too fat, too black, too country, too ghetto, too New York, too thug or too whatever! Nobody ultimately had the say over whether or not I was going to make it.","Sometimes I gotta look in the mirror and say, 'Hey, they're still saying you're too fat, but you're here! They gotta take it or leave it.' And in most cases, if they leave it, it's all good because they don't need to be in my space anyway.","I grew up in a very strict Pentecostal household.","As you know, I'm a black girl out of the projects of New York City, raised in a single parent home because my parents divorced very very young... welfare and homeless at four and then again at 16 and just not having the things or the necessary tools that society would say I needed to have in order to be any kind of success in life.","On paper, my history says that my future was not very promising. But through grace, I have the opportunity to prove that where you start is not where you have to end up.","A lot of times you'll have somebody who could be the most talented person in the world, but because they are plus-sized, they're not even considered for a call back.","I was known for being talented, but I was still the fat girl. And it wasn't what people were looking for. There's a lot that you hear. There's a lot of cruelty out there. Some of it comes from the executive offices. It comes from other artists at times. It was a very difficult thing to overcome.","When I first came into the business, I had to, for the sake of being able to sell myself as an artist, always be happy and jovial and smiling. I was the happy nice girl, and I am the happy nice girl, but I have my moments, too.","My weight has been one of the most challenging things that I've had to deal with throughout my career.","There are many artists who feel that in order to move forward in their careers, they have to lose a drastic amount of weight.","I'm not nearly as big as I was, but I attribute that to eating healthy. I'm just not a skinny girl, and I just want to give more opportunities to people like me.","It's hard to come across someone who can look past an artist who is larger and just see them for the talent they are and have them be willing to invest what's necessary to make them a star."],"Kelly Reilly":["Literally, I don't know where life is gonna go from one day to the next, and that's as exciting as it is tiring.","Auditioning is a horrible experience because you know you are being absolutely scrutinized and judged. There are days where you can do it and days where it's just not happening, and I feel like that's how it is with all artists; you have some days it kind of works.","I hate to say that my mother was 'just a housewife', because in addition to that she has had lots of part-time secretarial jobs in factories and hospitals, always working really hard for our family.","I love strong women in films that are allowed to play women and not male fantasies.","Every job feels like my first.","My dad is such a good man, hard-working.","Obviously, education is hugely important, along with healthcare. They're the basics and you're hurting your own country if you don't pour money into them.","I'm not a show-off; I'm not an exhibitionist.","I think when you're an actor and you're drawing on your emotions all the time, you need to be quite steady.","As an actor, you always want to keep it different, change it up, and, you know, just to keep yourself inspired and work with interesting characters.","I love actresses who are brave and don't do what's expected of them or don't play off how they look or take risks.","I'd prefer to go under the radar and just do the acting without being famous for it.","I've no wish to appear in celebrity magazines.","You put yourself on tape as an actor a lot - and you send them off, they go out into the ether, and you have no idea what's going to come back, or when.","My personal life, my normal life, is so important to me. To be able to go back to my personal life and leave characters behind is important; I don't keep them with me.","At my school, Shakespeare wasn't on the syllabus - at least not for me.","I'm not temperamentally into high comedy. I'm not a Noel Coward kind of girl.","Theatre is where my heart is. It's where I can do my best work. And even if I do films and TV, that's what I want to come back to.","When I was younger, I used to write to directors when I was unsure I could play a role. I'd say: 'You've made a terrible mistake.'","It's lovely to work with a group of actors who make you laugh and smile.","We live in a celebrity-obsessed society.","The reason I act is because I'm trying to understand why people are as they are.","Acting has always been such escapism for me.","I'm a theater actress. I love rehearsal. I could have six weeks of rehearsal and think it's not enough. But on film, you don't get that luxury.","You know, I really enjoy longevity. I see actors in their forties and they just turn out these really fabulous roles and characters. You know who they are, but you wouldn't necessarily know their names.","When it comes to my work, I'm fearless. I go with my gut.","Being at the pinnacle of my career is not to turn up in some multiplex blockbuster.","The British theatre and establishment is so hard to penetrate, and there are so many talented people involved in it. So, to be counted among some of those actresses... It doesn't get better than that.","I need someone who understands an artist's mentality. I couldn't be with someone who wouldn't let me have my freedom.","I'd love to work on a real girl piece with some fabulous actresses. I feel like I've worked with so many men.","I don't want to be doing fashion shoots and being interviewed about where I shop. Who cares?","I act because I have to, because I need to find out whether I can do it or not - that's what drives me and excites me and lights me up.","My family believe you should never be flashy about anything. Maybe that handicapped me a little bit, that extreme humility.","There is a part of me that is not fulfilled by acting. It is a self-involved life; it can feel shallow, but not very often.","Women do well in their thirties. They put their bags down and say, 'This is who I am - like it or lump it.' There is a more relaxed quality, which I like."],"Kelly Ripa":["If there's cheesecake in the house, I'll have some.","Having been a cheerleader, I know all too well what these girls give up to join forces and compete.","I think children are like pancakes. You sort of ruin the first one, and you get better at it the second time around.","If I feel any sort of emotional upheaval, I go for a jog and I feel better.","I'd rather not have a moment when I'm known for my looks; being funny and interesting lasts longer.","There's no such thing as an uber-mom.","If you're a waiter and you're waiting on me, you might get five percent, you might get seventy percent. It depends on how bad my math skills are that day.","When I'm at work, I'm remembering what I forgot to do for the kids, and when I'm with the kids, I'm remembering what I forgot to do at work.","Sleeping is not something I do a lot of.","I try to make my heart beat out of my chest, hard-core, once a day for at least a half hour. I think that's very important.","Please get on an airplane or a horse, because it's pretty spectacular.","I'm not a prettier everywoman. I am an everywoman that they clean up awfully well for T.V.","In some ways, her life is so much worse that everybody else's, people feel almost cheered up and inspired. They feel like, 'If Hayley hasn't killed herself, why should I?'","I get paid to make out with the hunks!","I work out every day. It's part of my life. That's one of the benefits of having kids in school full-time.","I'm usually done with work around 11am, so I have time before I pick the kids up from school.","I feel like my mind is a little quieter when I exercise.","When you have an entire amphitheatre of people laughing that way, it makes you feel so funny and it frees you to go further than you probably would.","I had a picture-perfect childhood.","My parents were like June and Ward Cleaver; there was nothing dysfunctional about them.","I'll quit tanning when the satchel handle grows out of my back.","I'm like any working mom.","I work out with a trainer, Anna Kaiser, three days a week.","If I'm exhausted and I just don't feel like it, then I don't do it. I am a human being, after all. But I also know I'm the kind of person who, if I take one day off, well, it's very easy for me to take the next day off and then quit exercising.","I don't have the best family history heart-wise, so I really try to keep my heart strong."],"Kelly Rowan":["Being on a successful television show is a good thing. It's steady work. It's a chance to work with a group of people in an intimate way... where you develop a sort of shorthand with each other, and a trust.","Who really cares what a celebrity thinks on a given issue?","I never wanted to be an actress who complained about the lack of roles for women.","A casting director who'd cast me in 'Assassins' sent a video to Kevin Reynolds, the director, and Mel Gibson, whose company is producing '187.' Then I went in and auditioned, and a few hours later, they called me.","I have a shoe habit. If I'm in New York, it's a problem because I'm walking and I have access to more stores. In L.A., it's not as bad."],"Kelly Rowland":["Never give up on your dream... because you never know what the Lord can bless you with.","We all have different things that we go through in our everyday life, and it's really important to know just at the end of the day, it doesn't matter what you face, you know, that you're going to win at the end of the day. You got to believe in yourself. You got to believe in God, know that He's going to get you through it.","Judge me if you want to. And as a matter of fact, it won't even count, 'cause the only person who can judge is God.","I do sing in the car. I actually sing Britney Spears songs in the car - me and a close friend of mine. She lives in West Palm and I live in Miami, and when we're going back and forth to see each other, we sing: 'Oh, Baby Baby.' We sing all these 1990s songs. We're like two 14-year-old kids just having a good time.","I think the most beautiful thing is that we're not parting because there were problems. We're parting because we're celebrating each others' growth.","I actually started singing in church when I was about five years old. I remember looking at the choirs and just hearing all of those great big beautiful voices. And there was this one woman who could just wail. And I remember trying to sing like her when I was like going home.","I see the beauty in boxing. It teaches me strength physically, but mostly mentally. I had to learn my strength, because for so long I could have been tougher than I was.","One thing that I had to remember in my personal journey in the music industry and coming up in the music industry was how many times I was told no. I was signed, I was dropped, I was signed, and I was put on a shelf.","Self-reflection is so healthy. Journaling works for me - when I record the details of what I'm going through, whether it's a relationship issue or negative thoughts, I can look back and see how far I've come. It makes me proud to see my progress and how I got through a bad situation.","We all come to the point where it's time to get yourself straight, as a businesswoman, a mother, whatever you are in life. It's tough love but it's also being real with yourself. It's important to take those rose-coloured glasses off and see what's going on.","For a long time I wasn't happy, but that had nothing to do with Beyonce. That had to do with me trying to get my life in order and make better decisions for myself. I'm seeing all these wonderful things happen for her, and I am happy for her. But I want a path. I want things to pop off for me, too.","Don't look at someone else and want to be them. Search within yourself and find out who you are and be someone positive.","It took a long while for me to know that I'm beautiful. I remember going through this phase when I was younger of wanting to pass by mirrors and not look at them. That was so ridiculous. I've learned now that beauty starts from within.","If you don't know your worth, if you don't know your value, if you don't know how fantabulous you are - it's going to be hard for other people to see it. Being appreciative of self is beauty to me.","I just love clothes! I'm a girl who loves clothes, accessories, shoes, bags and jewelry.","I saw someone the other day with yellow on their eyelids, and it looked so fresh. But I thought if I did that I'd look like a clown. So I went and I bought some yellow eye shadow from M.A.C. and I noticed that when you mix it with water it works better. So I tried it, and I looked like Big Bird. I will never do that again.","Ever since we were little, we were so on fire for our dreams. We never let anyone blow our flames out.","Honesty, like my mama always says, is always the best policy.","I'm in love with wigs. I get them custom-made, and I have my hairstylist shape them to my head. I can go from short to long in less than a minute!","I'm just steadily building myself up as Kelly Rowland, not just Kelly Rowland of Destiny's Child, which is a blessing to be able to do that.","Sometimes dirty can come off really cute or come off 'I don't even want you to touch me.'","When you want something bad enough, you work your butt off for it.","I always hope that my music can inspire someone, the same way other artists inspire me.","I remember I went through a period where I didn't embrace my 'chocolatiness.' I don't know if that's a word, but I didn't embrace my chocolate lifestyle. Just being a chocolate, lovely brown skin girl and being proud of that.","I ain't gonna get this, it's a horror movie, it's hard to act scared.","I started crying, because there's nothing like hearing that the artist who originally did the song likes your version.","For right now, it really is the end. Hopefully in 10 years we'll all be married and have babies.","The only thing I really love is Fiji water. That's like the only crazy request - I don't like any other water.","I love a nicely groomed guy who smells good. That's important.","I don't get hit on enough.","I want to tell stories and make people feel good. That's when music is at its finest.","I just feel like Brits are honest - period. And that's what I like.","You know how the Beatles broke off - they all did their solo projects and they came back together and they were even stronger!","I would never become a size zero. I work out because I want to look good naked, simple as that.","I am not perfect! When I was a little girl I thought I was ugly. My nose was too big for my face.","If I think I'm going to get into trouble I always say that I'm sick.","I'm kind of a germ freak. When I get on a plane, I spray my seat and everything with Lysol Disinfectant Spray.","I wear men's cologne - it gets the fellas!","I love food so much, all I have to do is look at it and I gain 5 pounds.","I'm careful with my heart. I don't take crap from no one these days. I put my foot down. Being a woman, you deserve heaven and earth.","When I get married, it will be for life - divorce is not an option.","I went to a predominantly white school, and I was the only black girl. I can remember thinking, 'I don't want to be as dark as I am - I want to be a little fairer.' I didn't want to be me.","As women, we have to realize what we bring to the table. What do you want to do for the world? How do you want to change it? And when you know that, you don't have to compare yourself to anybody else.","I'm from the South - I love to eat, and that's why I have to exercise.","Argh... I could be better with my time. I like to be punctual, but I could be better.","I never know when chat-up lines are happening! I don't hear them enough. I don't get hit on enough.","Coming into the music industry, even when I was a kid, one thing I learned is timing is everything. You being prepared is everything.","I love finding new talent, to be completely honest, and my opportunity that I got to do 'X Factor U.K.' was just incredible. I will never forget it.","If you have a pair of shoes that hurt, don't wear them. The ugliest thing that I think I've seen is a woman walk like her feet hurt. It's awful, so make sure your shoes fit.","My face and skin trick is to moisturise well in the winter time, because the weather eats up your skin, and I never go to sleep with make up on. Someone told me it ages you ten years.","I would never go blonde. I'd look crazy.","Could I see myself with a British boyfriend? Absolutely. The way they wear their pants is so cute. Guys don't do it in America. Their style is cute. I just feel like Brits are honest - period. And that's what I like.","When it comes to racial issues, I'm very passionate about young girls just loving who they are in their own skin. Because I remember going to an all-white school and being the only black girl in an all-white school, think - looking around me, thinking there's no one else here that looks like me.","I made a stamp with Destiny's Child. We made a stamp together, above anything. And making a stamp on my own, I'm very proud.","I actually crashed the car I learned to drive on. It was a friend of mine's car.","I did live over in the U.K. for a while, so I guess I'm just naturally a Brit at heart.","I love doing collaborations - it's always good to do something that's out the box."],"Kelly Rutherford":["You live your life day by day and find ways to get through it. You grow up through things that are challenging and you find the joy. You realize there are so many people that have it much worse and remind yourself. I have been very blessed.","I get I style inspiration everywhere: the streets of New York, magazines... everywhere!","I think high school's very difficult. You're figuring out your own power and your effect on other people. You look back and see how you spent so much energy on figuring out things with your parents or your peers.","Every penny from 'Gossip Girl,' my pension, my stocks has been spent fighting for my children.","I am a mother and I have been divorced, and I love fashion and the Upper East Side.","I love Hermes, Lanvin, Brunello Cucinelli, Reed Krakoff, Alice + Olivia and Nanette Lepore.","There are so many fun charity festivals in the Hamptons. We enjoy so many fun events for kids such as Kidsfest. We also go to Super Saturday. We like to chill out and go out by the pool. We do things that are fun for kids and good for charity.","I'm very good at ordering off the menu and eating food that other people cook for me. My husband's a fantastic cook. I always come with a good appetite!","I live in jeans and T-shirts, and usually just throw stuff on over that. I love Brunello Cucielli, J.Crew for basics, NYDJ and DL1961 for jeans, and Magaschoni for sweaters.","I actually don't watch much TV, but my goal is to watch 'Downton Abbey.' I want to catch up on the series... that's like my style.","We eat all organic at home, so if we're running around and the kids want a hot dog or pretzel, I'll get it for them.","I think it's mainly when I need inspiration I look at the old pictures. I don't find it as much in the new stuff. I love Carole Lombard. I think she's wonderful. Gloria Grahame was really great. Garbo. Dietrich. People knew how to create an illusion. Now everything is very realistic and straightforward. Everyone's grunge."],"Kelly Slater":["There are so many different elements to surfing. Small waves, big waves, long boards, short boards. This makes it a sport you can share with people. It's not just a solitary thing - it's become a family thing, too. It's about exercising and passing something on from father to son, and from mother to daughter.","For a surfer, it's never-ending. There's always some wave you want to surf.","A wave isn't like a skate ramp or mountain; everything's moving around and you have to time how to move along with it. That's easier with a slow wave.","I've been in a poor physical shape many times in my career and I've had some of my best results. My best performances happened because my mind was in the right place. The mind is definitely stronger than the body.","My belief is that 'heaven' and 'hell' are metaphorical terms for what you make of your life. In any instant, you have the ability to make your life total pleasure or total hell.","I still feel like my best surfing is ahead of me.","Most anything I've ever set my mind to, I could accomplish.","Fatherhood isn't always a planned thing, but when it happens you just do it. It's very natural and in that sense it's not really difficult.","Surfing is my religion, if I have one.","A lot of times I'll see guys who are nowhere near the level of the board they're riding. They might love surfing and love how it looks, but you really have to work your way up. It takes eating a little humble pie at first, and stepping back to equipment that might be a bit slow, but do it.","When I'm 50 I want to be a better surfer than I am now - for me it's a lifelong journey.","Maintaining marriage seems to be tougher than fatherhood: apparently it's the most difficult thing in the world.","I feel like an ambassador for surfing at this point. I'm happy to go and play that role and share that where I can in certain areas of the mainstream media that doesn't get the surfing attention.","I surf more now for other people than myself. I feel a lot of support from people wanting me to do well, and I feed off that. I can send a positive message to people from what I do.","Most of what Hawaii has to offer is no secret. Pipeline is probably the most famous wave in the world.","It's a perfect wave when small and the most beautiful and scary wave on Earth when it's big, as the swell from deep water hits the shallow reef ledge. A ten-foot high wave and a 30-footer break in the same depth of water.","I wanted to be a comedian.","Big waves are a whole different ball game. You're riding a wave with an immense amount of speed and power, generally over 10 meters. On the face of the wave, obviously life and death thoughts start to happen."],"Kelly Stables":["When I was a little girl, the only real form of entertainment I was exposed to was theater, being raised in St. Louis, and I still love theater, and I think sitcoms are similar to that, in there's a live audience, and you know, I definitely like the comedy of it, too. I like to make people laugh, and I definitely think laughter is healing.","I love the show tunes; I love all of them.","I'm at the stage in my pregnancy where I don't feel pregnant. You feel very, 'Oh yeah, I'm pregnant,' because you're over the morning sickness and it's not too uncomfortable. It's fun.","Like many actors, I started off as a monkey. My first job ever was as an extra in Tim Burton's 'Planet of the Apes.' I'm the tiny little monkey in the background. I met Rick Baker doing that - then, because of my size and the fact I was older than 18, he figured I could double Daveigh Chase in 'The Ring.'","I love saying dialogue and creating a full character more than just being physical. But I always end up doing physical stuff in my roles.","I was fortunate enough to book a pilot, and we just got picked up for a midseason replacement for ABC. It's called 'Romantically Challenged,' and I'm going to be playing Alyssa Milano's little sister. The other actor in it is Kyle Bornheimer from 'Worst Week' - he's hilarious.","Wearing a monkey suit really lets you know where you stand as an actor."],"Kelly Sue DeConnick":["If you have a smartphone - and you have a smartphone - then you have a comic book store in your pocket. So you don't have to get over any social anxiety you have about entering that space.","Everything that feminism stands for is everything American, white, red and blue democratic. It is all the same stuff. So, I am boggled that I should have to give up this term that encapsulates what I want for my children, for my world, culture, brothers and sister because someone else thinks it means I don't shave my armpits.","Being a woman in a male-dominated industry sort of sucks, but it doesn't suck any more than being a woman in the world. My advice? Be terrifying.","Marvel is run by some very smart people, and they seem to pride themselves on the fact that they don't just find talent, they groom talent.","One of the things I enjoyed when working in manga was when I couldn't tell where anything was going because there weren't narrative tropes and structures I was used to. After doing it for seven years, I got to the point where I did see structures. I did start to learn, but at first I didn't know where it was going. It was very exciting for me.","For hard resets, conventions and conferences can be inspiring.","Comics are not theatre - there's a very important difference in that the reader controls the page. You can linger on a page of comics as long as you want. You can read and go forward and then move back; you can reread, in one sitting or at your leisure. You can take as much time as you want to take in that story.","I hate when I get asked, 'What's it like to be a woman in comics?'","The notion that somehow women are wildly different infuriates me.","I am a nerd among nerds.","I think women have every right to feel like they're the protagonists in their own stories.","I like my heroes to be imperfect; I like them to be striving. I identify with that kind of aspiration to do better.","Girls have always read comics. There's nothing intrinsically masculine about telling stories with pictures.","There's nothing less funny than trying to force funny.","I'm not particularly good at page layouts. I make an effort to stay out of the way of the artist. What I'll try to express instead is, 'What we're going for here on this page is the idea of the containment of these women's bodies. So I want them framed as though they're bursting out of the panel borders.'","Anybody who's read 'Pretty Deadly' knows that I tend to savor an immersive, 'You'll figure it out as you go!' style. 'Pretty Deadly' really does not hold your hand.","'Pretty Deadly' is the story of these immortal and mortal characters, and the mortals' story follows Sarah's family, a black family, through the ages. I never made the choice of, 'Oh, this is gonna be the story of an African American family!'","If there was any creature in American culture more derided than the young girl... I know people will argue with me about that, but everything girls are into gets ridiculed. I have a lot of compassion in my heart for girls in their teens and twenties who are going through this particular passage, because I get it. It makes sense!","I need to go where I'm not comfortable. I think that's the artist's job.","Complicated feelings are fertile soil for creative ideas.","My son is such a lover, such a caretaker and so funny. He's seven, and he genuinely cracks me up. And my daughter is a fearless powerhouse. They fill me with wonder and admiration.","Going into the second arc, I'm making a conscious effort to do something I say I never do, which is to change my style because of feedback. I'm trying to make 'Pretty Deadly' more accessible by being more clear in the writing.","I tend to choose collaborators who are more courageous than I am. I think it's good for me.","I think I'm very strong at dialogue, I think I'm very strong in characterization. I think sometimes I use dialogue and character work to cover weaknesses in my plotting.","One of the things about comics is people can linger on images and words as long as they want.","I think women are vital to the future of the superhero comics and the entire industry - as creators, as editors, as consumers, as retailers.","Yes, the Bechdel Test. It's named for Allison Bechdel, who is a comic book creator. The test is, are there two named women in the film? Do they talk to each other? And is it about something other than a man? I actually think the Bechdel Test is a little advanced for us sometimes.","I want young women to see my name on 'Avengers Assembled' and to know that there are women who write mainstream superhero comics, and if it is something that interests them, it can be done.","If you want to, if you are a crazy person, you could go from idea to the stands in about four months. It does not cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to make a comic the way it does to make a television show or a movie.","Romantic relationships are the least interesting thing for me to write about. I'm 45, and that's not the most interesting thing in my life anymore.","Years ago - I used to be an actor - I was in a production of Vaclav Havel's 'Temptation,' and when we started rehearsals, he was in prison. When we closed the show, he was running for president. And it felt incredibly timely and important and also this lucky thing.","I do make some conscious efforts to write female friendships, intergenerational female friendships. I make a conscious effort to include things that I see as important real parts of my life that are not reflected as much as I think they should be in popular culture. We very seldom have the opportunity to see women compete and remain friends.","In popular culture, when women compete, it's usually over a man, and it's usually very nasty. And that is just frankly not my experience. That's just some kind of popular mythology, it feels like. I find it insulting.","I'm really just trying... to write what feels true to me. I don't think about a lofty responsibility. I think I'd be paralyzed by that. Like any of my male colleagues, I'm writing the stories that interest me in a way that feels true to me.","Gray space is fertile ground for fiction. When I can see both sides of an argument and feel strongly in both directions, then there's a story there, then I can write real characters that I care about and believe in and champion on both sides.","If you can remove a female character from your plot and replace her with a sexy lamp and your story still works, you're a hack.","With Marvel, I obviously don't own the characters, so there are levels of approval to go through. But I'm very seldom told no, and never without reason. Maybe I've just been lucky; I don't know, but I don't think it's as frustrating as people generally imagine. I act as though I own it all while I'm writing, I think. I hope, anyway.","Because of the nature of monthly comics and deadline, I pretty much have to work on whatever's on fire, I'm afraid.","You'll go mad trying to figure out what people want. I don't bother. I write the stories I want to read.","I think 'The Avengers' is a Black Widow movie. She saves the day. And if you take her out, the plot does not function.","I used to be good at clothes shopping and whatnot - at least ,I think I was! - but at some point after two kids and a career that worked out better than I ever could have imagined, I looked up from my desk and realized that I wore the same three t-shirts and 15-year-old jeans every day.","You don't usually have to wait a month for a new episode of a TV show. We ask comic readers to wait a month for a new issue, and honestly, given the time that it takes to put them together, a month is really too fast.","In a weird way, I think I'm much better at oneshots than longform. So I try to focus on five or six-issue arcs. I have a real fondness for the one-shots because that's where I do my best storytelling.","I kind of resent the suggestion that there would be something inherent about superheroes that wouldn't be of interest to women. That makes me nuts. I'm a 5-foot tall woman with a quick temper who always looks like a child, so power fantasies are not strange to me.","I don't think working in superheroes is slumming it. I'm proud of this form. I like this. There's nothing inherently masculine about power fantasies. There's nothing inherently masculine about superhero comics. There's nothing inherently masculine about mythology. About science fiction.","Part of a writer's job is just spacing out, looking into the air and imagining things.","With 'Pretty Deadly,' I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a three-act structure in it. I don't know - someone probably can.","'Female Convict 701: Scorpion' is based on a manga as is 'Lady Snowblood.' I saw 'Lady Snowblood' in the theater between writing issue three and issue four of the first arc of 'Pretty Deadly,' and I was really surprised how much I was influenced by it.","I used to write reviews for 'Artbomb.' Our policy was to only cover books we loved and recommended.","The first gift my husband ever gave me was a pack of index cards. I'm pretty sure the second was a 'Powers' scriptbook. This was well before either of us worked for Marvel.","I feel like I have a kind of mirror blindness where it's hard for me to characterize or analyze my own work. I suspect I'm not unique in this regard."],"Kelly Wearstler":["My motto in life is 'Take risks;' you don't have a voice if you don't. You have to venture outside your boundaries. That's what life's all about.","I love history... everything is inspired by history, so that's why I love vintage and antiques.","I look at every piece of furniture and every object as an individual sculpture.","The single most important key to success is to be a good listener.","Whether you're going to a museum or a flea market or flipping through a book, always be on the lookout for something special.","Hollywood style means classic glamour. My reference is the 1940s through the 1960s.","Rawness and refinement are not opposite ends of a luxurious spectrum... they are two complementary features with which to populate a luxe environment.","The same time I'm designing my collection, I'm also designing my store. It has to have brand awareness, an identity. I'm also designing the racks and the hangers, and juggling a lot of things.","Having an eye is one thing, but you have to be able to execute.","I am just a curious gal who is continuing to be curious.","Everything is about color. If you look at magazines and advertising and television, the thing you remember is the color.","I definitely start early and keep items in mind throughout the year for key people in my life. I love wrapping everyone's gifts in hand-painted wallpaper sheets, which gives the gift extra love.","Once I've designed something, I immediately move on to the next thing.","I love to travel and to be inspired by new things, so everything is always new. I've never done the same bathroom or the same kitchen a second time. It's challenging, and I like to be challenged.","The mixture of weird textures and organic surfaces creates an interesting dialogue.","I'm a designer, which includes interiors, architecture, fashion, furniture, and lifestyle.","Besides almonds or granola, I don't eat a lot during the day - juicing is what gives me energy.","I'm not the bake-sale-mom type - though once in a while, I'll make challah French toast for my sons.","My husband and I go to Il Fico every Friday, and I get the whole-wheat pizza. I won't eat pizza anywhere else!","Hollywood Regency is a label some people put on me, but I consider myself a modernist in that I always try to make the work feel fresh.","Informed clients are better clients, and they make for better design.","The best thing I ever bought is a vintage Oscar de la Renta short gingham dress that I wore to my rehearsal dinner the night before my wedding.","By acquiring all of your furniture from different eras and places and things that are expensive and inexpensive, it will make your end product have a great spirit.","There is a voice, and there is a DNA to how I design.","I need art around me always.","I do not like being in front of the camera.","I've never seen most of the fashion reality shows. The only one I've seen is 'Project Runway,' which is great, but I don't watch television.","My mother handed down all these amazing scarves from the sixties and seventies, and I have a hundred of them.","The sky is the limit as long as you keep the rooms practical, and I have become better at that since I had children. Function, form and organisation are all important.","I would never shop from the Internet or a catalogue; otherwise, how am I going to educate my eye? I just love going out and searching for new things.","Everything I commission - whether it is for me or for a client's home or for a hotel or office - is absolutely unique to that job. I have everything made, or I find vintage and antique pieces at markets and auctions.","Willem de Kooning as an artist is insane, Sonia Rykiel is amazing for her colour sensibility, and Ettore Sottsass was an architect and product designer who sometimes created clothes to go with his other designs.","Every year, my boys and I create new cool gift wrap paper. We hand paint the design and come up with interesting ways to wrap each gift.","I love seeing people's reactions to gifts that I've created from my line, such as my gold horn ring, bottle openers, my 'Fallen' leather jacket and my Slither black and white sweater."],"Kellyanne Conway":["Sexual harassment is as difficult to prove as it is to disprove.","Nothing creates a winner quite like earning it, not just inheriting it.","The fact is that Hillary Clinton could not stand up to a cheating husband, so how in the world would she stand up to North Korea and some of our other enemies around the globe?","If you heard 40 times in a day that Newt Gingrich takes the wings off of butterflies, eventually you'd believe it.","To women, a flip-flopper is the functional equivalent of the guy who never calls and always changes his mind.","Voters go into the ballot box with big ideas in their mind: leadership, change, experience, hope.","I never knew how ugly and how stupid I was until, you know, we had Twitter.","I think that people have realized it's very unwise to bet against Donald Trump.","Most women say 'Please speak to me from the waist up: my brain, my eyes.'","If the Republican Party does not learn to understand unmarried women as the political force and potent voting bloc that they have become, we risk becoming the minority party.","Most political wives are accidental politicians.","Women look at the full measure of the man, not just one comment.","The average American is more focused on leadership than likeability. And more focused on qualifications than quality of speakership.","In New York, the currency is money. You have money, and you get anonymity.","Women in my focus groups, they say a bald man is trustworthy. He has nothing to hide.","Pro-lifers believe there are two victims in an abortion: the unborn child and the woman who felt that that was her best option.","African Americans are concerned about the scourge of abortion in their community, and respond to related facts and figures. Large majorities agree that every life should have a chance, regardless of race, socioeconomic status or circumstance.","I've noticed a lot of people are very bold and blustery on Twitter because it's easy to do that with the poison keyboard and a hundred and forty characters.","Donald Trump is at his very best, at his very best, when he talks about the issues.","Republican politics can sometimes feel like you're walking into, you know, an Elks Club or bachelor party.","I tell people all the time, 'Don't be fooled, because I am a man by day.'","What's happened with the over-the-counter birth control issue is that the Democrats didn't see it coming. They think that they've got a monopoly on talking to women from the waist down. Anything that has to do with reproduction and birth control and abortion - they call it women's health, then they call it women's issues.","Candidates matter. Campaigns matter. 'He can win' or 'She can't win' is up there with, 'I'm going to lose 10 pounds, win the lottery, and live forever.' Saying it does not make it so.","It wasn't like anybody said, 'Oh, Ronald Reagan will have a landslide in 1980.' In fact, you look back at the Dukakis numbers, the Perot numbers, there was always this presumption that the Republican was going to lose. Not just that the Democrat would win, but that the Republican was going to lose.","Donald Trump embraces his wealth. Hillary Clinton wants us to forget that she made $21.5 million on 92 speeches.","Voters tend to reject overreach and distraction - women in particular.","The caricatures that the mainstream media and the Democrats have about Republicans have taken hold.","I don't sugarcoat things, but I'm very polite in delivering them.","Americans overwhelmingly believe that Americans who want to do jobs, who are looking for work, should have a fair opportunity, if not a preference, to do that work.","Voters deserve - and they indeed expect - a good debate on the issues.","I want to do right, apart from my gender - I want to do right as a campaign manager.","I've been in a very male-dominated business for decades. I found, particularly early on, that there's plenty of room for passion, but there's very little room for emotion.","2016 is a change election, and that favors Trump.","Donald Trump performs consistently better in online polling, where a human being is not talking to another human being about what he or she may do in the election.","The hidden Trump vote in this country is a very significant proposition.","Romney, like Sen. John McCain and Bob Dole before him, were meant to mollify moderates, attract Independents, and 'rebrand' the party in a way that mostly fits the ideal of media types who would never vote Republican anyhow. Each of them lost.","Former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton and President Barack Obama, each were told repeatedly, 'You can't win.' They all won.","I didn't even know I was the first female Republican campaign manager until someone pointed it out to me on Twitter, and I said that can't be true. And then I realized this must be such a small group of women. And right away, I know them all - Susan Estrich and Donna Brazile and Beth Myers - and I respect them enormously.","To me, it's a different kind of voter suppression to constantly try to make people feel like the election is over before it's even begun.","The errors in media polling rarely benefit a Republican.","To be confronted as you exit the polling place is really a matter of if you have the time, if you have the inclination to speak to a stranger, and if you want to divulge what is a very sacred, private matter - the way that you just voted.","I look at what the polls say about attributes. I noticed in 2004 that George W. Bush led John Kerry by double digits for eight straight months on the question of who is more likely to take a position and stick with it.","Very few people know anybody like John McCain, someone who suffered and had his body, yet not his spirit, broken for six years as a POW and who has served his nation.","In Gov. Huckabee's case, consistency is seen as principle... and that's incredibly valuable to voters.","Gov. Huckabee seems like somebody who could run effectively against a female candidate and not make it seem like he's being derogatory and impolite.","The fact is, in Mike Huckabee's case, he can say, 'I was a preacher, I'm a Christian, and so I believe that life begins at conception, ends at natural death.'","Caucuses are different than primaries, and winner-take-all primaries are how Mitt Romney eventually took over Newt Gingrich in 2012 and why Rick Santorum left.","Women have been late-in-the-game deciders. They weigh all of the issues, all of the images, and all of the information and make a choice almost at the last minute.","Women overwhelmingly support conservative policies.","Hillary is the Mitt Romney of 2016, where she has very little in common with the average person. She doesn't drive herself anywhere, she doesn't put on her own makeup, she doesn't cook her own meals, and she doesn't research her own materials. She has very little in common with the average woman.","Americans don't believe that we have a surplus of jobs. They believe that we have a surplus of job seekers, and they are competing for these jobs.","Women are still congenitally Democratic - and I'm the Republican pollster saying that.","Women, if left to their own devices, are going to tend and trend Democratic. That is absolutely the case.","The Republican Party is too fixated on this fiction of electability.","Women are trying to have it all but are trying to regain control over their time. That's why many women are busting out of the traditional workforce and starting their own businesses.","Washington is built on power.","Although it shouldn't be, men behaving badly is sort of an occupational hazard for those working in Washington.","John McCain was one of the senators who voted against George Herbert Walker Bush's disastrous break of his no new taxes pledge when he raised taxes in 1990. That's really important. He's a supply-sider. And he's got supply siders like Phil Graham and Jack Kemp to vouch for that.","The country is increasingly culturally conservative, with a small C. Every time marriage is on the ballot, it passes. People are increasingly pro-life. They don't like taxes.","We got Defense of Marriage Act as a federal law from President Bill Clinton. And it was passed with bipartisan support.","I think it's important for people to understand that this started with President Bill Clinton. He, as president, thought it was such a big priority, he passed the defense of marriage - defense of traditional non-gay marriage - that we have it as a federal law.","You live by the media, you live by the polls, you've got to suffer by the polls, too.","Of course there's racism in this country, and we have a terrible history of that in this nation."],"Kelsang Gyatso":["Our mind is like a cloudy sky: in essence clear and pure, but overcast by clouds of delusions. Just as the thickest clouds can disperse, so, too, even the heaviest delusions can be removed from our mind.","The purpose of meditation is to make our mind calm and peaceful. If our mind is peaceful, we will be free from worries and mental discomfort, and so we will experience true happiness. But if our mind is not peaceful, we will find it very difficult to be happy, even if we are living in the very best conditions.","Usually, we find it difficult to control our mind. It seems as if our mind is like a balloon in the wind - blown here and there by external circumstances.","To meditate is to familiarise our mind constantly and thoroughly with a virtuous object.","We will discover through our own experience that this precious mind of love is the real wish-granting jewel, because it fulfills the pure wishes of both ourself and all living beings.","Every living being has the potential to become a Buddha: someone who has completely purified his or her mind of all faults and limitations and has brought all good qualities to perfection.","Happiness and suffering are feelings - parts of our mind - and so their main causes are not to be found outside the mind. If we really want to be truly happy and free from suffering, we must improve our understanding of the mind.","Due to mistakenly believing that outer problems are their own problems, most people seek ultimate refuge in the wrong objects. As a result, their suffering and problems never end.","Some people believe I am the third Buddha, but this is people's choice. From me, never. I have never pretended I am special."],"Kelsea Ballerini":["I've always been drawn to the message of 'Be yourself. Love yourself.' I need to be reminded of that all time.","I see little girls at my meet-and-greets who are like, 'Kelsea! It's my first concert and I came to see you.' And I'm thinking, 'I don't want to post anything online that your mom would be mad at me for, because you're important to me.'","Sometimes, if I really just need to unwind and kind of watch something that isn't gonna stress me out or have drama in it, I watch 'Spongebob.'","I'm so weird and quirky, and painfully awkward sometimes.","I've always been drawn to strong women in every genre, people who push the boundaries because they're just epic.","Music videos, to me, are like an extension of a song.","I've always been a big, bold thinker and a dreamer.","I really like food. Honestly, anytime I have time off, I binge-watch Netflix and eat chicken tenders. That's my guilty pleasure. Separate or together!","For a long time, because I'm pretty tall, I was scared to wear heels, but now I wear them all the time. I feel like I'm still discovering my stage style, but I love - well, I'm not a huge color person onstage, but I am in real life. I like short stuff, big heels, fringe, lots of fringe, sometimes sparkle, yeah!","You really do have to be different. You really do have to set yourself apart.","The first album is an introduction, and when people listen to it top to bottom, I want them to know me.","I get to remind myself and other people to be yourself, to rock you who you are, and don't worry about if it fits.","There's value in being a normal person.","The fun thing about song writing is that it's just creative. It can be whatever you want it to be. For me, I'm really protective of that. I'm not going to write something because I feel like it fits here or it fits there - I just want to write music that feels good to me, you know?","The whole heartbeat of the first record is young, which I think is what made it relatable to young girls.","I feel a loyalty to my favorite artists, and to have my fans feel that, for me, is a special bond because I've been there for so long.","I've never been scared, but I'm very naive.","Songwriting was a gift that came to me when I needed it the most.","My favorite festival beauty look is definitely braids and hats: a messy fishtail braid and a cute outfit, and I'm ready!","I love pop music. I listen to it; I think you can hear it in my songwriting and my album. I'd definitely say it's country-pop music, but it's country first.","As a fan, I connect with realness. Whether it's strong or vulnerable, if it's real, I can connect with it.","With Rascal Flatts, I'm such a fan of them, and I feel like they've been so gracefully relevant through decades of country music.","I've always wanted to dye my hair a bright color.","I was this little blond girl with a guitar case bigger than me - it was pink and sparkly at the time. But I always took myself seriously, and I think that people took that seriously. I would tell them about my goal list, and they listened. I was like, 'I want to be the one that swings the pendulum.'","We had three cows and a goat. People from New York and L.A. are like, 'Oh my gosh, that's a farm!' But people in Tennessee are like, 'That's not a farm.' I've never milked a cow or anything like that.","I was writing country songs, but I wasn't listening to country yet. I grew up on a farm in East Tennessee, so my roots are country, you know? But I didn't know where those songs came from or where they fit.","I grew up loving music, like, loving it. I was involved in church choir, leading worship and all the choirs in my school - even glee club.","When I was 13, I started writing songs, and it fell into my lap all of a sudden. I wrote poems and journals, but that's when it switched for me to songwriting. That's when I wanted to do everything. It was like a fire all of a sudden. I started coming to Nashville and moved here when I was 15.","I started writing songs by myself. That always came from whatever I was feeling and being honest about that because I never had any intention of anyone ever hearing them.","Being a songwriter is really the base of being an artist, for me.","My favorite songwriting trick is writing something like 'XO.' In my brain, I thought, 'This is probably going to be a love song. How can I change that and find ways to twist that.' As a songwriter, it's your job for the song to take twists and turns that people don't expect.","I am a fan before I am an artist. I was that twelve year old girl that looked up to Taylor Swift. I get what that role is as a fan. I think that because I know that, I'm really careful and intentional about what I say and what I put out. I want to be that role for anyone who wants me to be that.","Before I really knew country music, I listened to pop, and I still do.","I also grew up on a farm in east Tennessee, so my roots are just naturally super southern, so I've always had that southern country lifestyle.","I am such a girly girl, and I love not playing it safe. I'm so new to this world, so it's fun to establish myself as a fashionista.","The greatest gift I've been given is being naive, because I don't know what I can't do. And when you don't know what you can't do, you think you can do everything.","I have a picture of me with Lady Antebellum, when they released their first single and I was at CMA Fest as a fan. I'm in flower-power shorts and a headband - so not cute - and I'm fan-girling next to Hillary. I couldn't believe I was standing next to her.","My theory is the root of a country artist is truth and honesty. For me, I look at Sam Hunt. The truth and the honest thing is we have southern roots, we were raised in a southern way, but we listen to Drake and other stuff, too.","I was raised on a farm in East Tennessee, and my first concert was Britney Spears. It's my job as a country music artist to be honest about that.","I wouldn't be an artist if I didn't have Shania Twain, Faith Hill, Taylor Swift to look up to.","I always thought it was a goat that kicked me over the fence. My mama told me the other day it was a cow. Now I'm sort of scared of both.","There's a YouTube video of these two kittens that just fall over and pass out. My blood sugar's crazy, so I would pass out sometimes, like the fainting kittens.","Blake Lively is my style icon, and she always has rocking clothes and shoes. She keeps it really simple with hair and makeup, and I try to do the same thing. Onstage, I do a little smokier, a little more contouring, but I still always want to be an approachable and real artist, so I never try to go overboard.","I think that I've just kind of found my niche, if that makes sense. I still write the same, but I feel like I've found what separates me, and I always try to stay in that when I write. It took me a long time to discover that, so I try to be protective.","I danced for 10 years. I was on a competitive hip-hop team, but then I, like, grew seven inches in one year - not really, but I grew tall and really lanky, and I lost all my coordination.","I grew up performing in glee club at my school; I was the ostrich in 'Peter Pan,' and then I was super-involved in church choir and worship leading at my church. So I always loved music and was involved with it, but never really thought it was what I wanted to do until I started writing.","I would love to do a duet with Gavin Degraw. Or Ed Sheeran.","I listen to everything. I sing country music, but I listen to different stuff.","I starting writing when I was about 13 or 14 years old.","'The First Time' is a song that I wrote by myself on my front porch, in real-time, as that situation was happening to me.","I grew up on a farm in eastern Tennessee with a very southern lifestyle, so my roots are super country and southern, but my first concert was Britney Spears. I think that you can hear both of those influences in my music.","I think that, as artists, all we can do is be who we are. I think that if we do that, then we're automatically not anyone else.","I think that every time a country artist steps outside of the country boundary, it just brings more ears to us.","When Florida Georgia Line and Nelly put out the 'Cruise' remix, it brought so many more people to country music.","I wanted to be the girl that talks about getting a guy. I felt like that was a different approach to writing.","I love pop music. I've tried to always be honest about that.","I've studied live shows and artists for so long. I got the tour documentaries and all that and watched them. I love a show. I love an artist that can do all of it.","I love when an artist can stand by themselves and play their guitar and hold a crowd, but I also love bells and whistles.","I really want people to know I'm a songwriter.","The artists that I relate to and love the most are the ones where I can listen to the record, and I can know them better, and for me, that's writing it.","People send me songs all the time that are literally no-brainer hits... but for me, I'm an artist because I'm a writer.","I want to stay where I am. I'm stoked to be a country artist.","I have a huge appreciation for music in general, but my roots are country.","Even though there are incredible songs floating around Nashville, it's important for me to have my voice heard.","I love that on country radio, you can hear a George Strait song, and the next is Sam Hunt. I love that there's such a variety.","I like making people feel pretty.","I remember telling myself when I got to start having artist opportunities, 'Let yourself be a fan, because you are. The minute that you walk in a room with Carrie Underwood, and you're too cool to freak out, you need to check yourself.' I just let myself be a fan.","I was a huge Jonas Brothers fan, unapologetically, when I was 12 or 13.","The Grammys to me, well, that's my peers. That's the industry thinking what I do is good.","My biggest dream is to headline an arena tour.","Me and my mom made a deal that if something would happen to help me get my start in music, I could get out of college.","I used to walk around trying to do the Britney Spears growl: 'Oh, baby, baby.'","I'm in this wave with Maddie & Tae and RaeLynn and Mickey Guyton and Cam. We're all kind of finding our niches and becoming successful. I think that it's just been really fun to be with them and do this all together.","Honestly, I was a fan before I got the opportunity to be an artist. I was the kind of fan who would stand in line or post a cover video.","There are certain days I will get home, and something will pop up on my Twitter, and I will just cry about it. I get so overwhelmed that I get to do what I do.","I try to be a good person. I love Jesus.","My life is truly pop country.","I just want to make the best music I can make."],"Kelsey Chow":["I'm very lucky to have a strong support system with my friends and my family. They have kept me grounded.","It's fun to get away from myself for a while when I take on these roles that have very different personalities from my own. I get to say things I normally wouldn't say or act in ways I normally wouldn't act. After all, such roles are more challenging because you really have to immerse yourself in the character.","I wish I could read minds. It's a dangerous superpower, so I'd wish for it to come with a switch where I could turn it off if I wanted to. You'd learn a lot about people, that's for sure!","When you're young, you don't think about your career or your future - you perform because you love it.","'One Tree Hill' was my first television experience, so naturally I was nervous initially. There is no rehearsal, you get your script a few days ahead, and you work. I was also the youngest actor, 13, on set at that time, but it was amazing to be able to 'learn the ropes' with such a supportive group of people.","'Pair of Kings' is so much fun, literally. It is a very physical show with loads of stunts and green screen work, and you never know what great adventure is ahead of you! It's also a nice change in terms of being of similar ages to Doc Shaw and Mitchel Musso.","Dance and theatre afforded me the opportunity to discover my passion for acting, for telling stories.","My 94-year-old grandmother has always been so inspiring to me. She is kind, smart, brave, and independent. After graduating number one in her medical school class at a time when it was extremely rare for women to attend medical school, she worked with the World Health Organization in North Africa to eradicate tuberculosis.","'One Tree Hill' will always be very, very special to me. It was my first television show. And my first gig in the business. It was surreal. I booked the role when I was 13. I had just started high school, and literally, I think, a week into high school, I found out I got the role. It was unimaginable! I learned so much from that show.","I want to do roles that will challenge me. I'm definitely interested in period pieces. But I definitely don't want to limit myself. I'm very open to different roles.","I definitely want to study global health. Right now I'm working on all the prerequisite core curriculum that Columbia has. So getting all of that out of the way. And I definitely want to pursue something along the lines of public health.","I like vintage dresses that I can just slip on.","I enjoy having the ability to play a variety of ethnicities. Being ethnically ambiguous allows me to explore many roles, and I enjoy being free to be whoever I want to be.","I was really young when I started on 'One Tree Hill,' and the encouragement from my friends and family has been crucial in my development as an actress. I'm also continuously surprised and humbled by the kindness and generosity of the fans.","The more you love a person, you more you should respect that person. Encourage her to be the best she can be, and you'll both be happier.","'The Wine of Summer' is a beautiful film about love lost and found, and the complexities of life while discovering who you are. It was filmed primarily in and around Barcelona, and the imagery is breathtaking.","'Run' is exciting, about family secrets, the mystery surrounding them and the outdoor sport of parkour. The story itself is full of intrigue and action, but the parkour takes the story to another level. It was an absolutely incredible experience, working with experts from all over the country.","I enjoyed the drama of 'One Tree Hill,' and the opportunity to be one of the comedic aspects, initially.","I've always wanted to work with Sean Connery - there's something about his style, and his calm, cool demeanor that I find intriguing.","I love mixing prints. The costume designer for 'Pair of Kings' and I have actually incorporated the trend for my character 'Mikayla.'"],"Kelsey Grammer":["Prayer is when you talk to God. Meditation is when you're listening. Playing the piano allows you to do both at the same time.","Apologizes are pointless, regrets come too late. What matters is you can move, on you can grow.","Some of the greatest achievements ever have been achieved as a result of the Church. The Catholic Church. I'm not Catholic but yeah, the Church, for instance, you take a walk through the Vatican, and to your right is the double helix staircase built, I think, in 1138 or something.","All of the great music ever written is based upon the Mass. I mean, it's pretty extraordinary stuff, and I think it's done the world some good. And if you take a look at some of the mosques in the world, it calls you to worship the kind of beauty that's in there.","I think it's your duty to overcome what you inherit in life.","I'm a real geek and fan when it comes to 'Transformers.' I remember being at my first rehearsal for this film, and I looked over and saw the tractor trailer. I was thinking to myself, 'Oh, my. That's Optimus Prime.'","The idea of self-reliance is important to me, and that is echoed, in my way of thinking, by a conservative approach to politics.","I got fired when I was a dishwasher at Denny's. That set me back a little bit. You don't realize how important dishwashers are until you do the job.","I love to sit down and have my drink in the afternoon. It's so lovely if there's no noise, no calamities, no children that have to be attended to.","I miss her in my bones. I was her big brother. I was supposed to protect her - I could not... It very nearly destroyed me.","I'm an actor and I've created a lasting and memorable character named Frasier, who is not me, but who most people think is. So when I have a chance to play something that's different, I embrace it because it's fun; also in this case, he's a memorable character.","Fame obviously has become a premium in everybody's life. Everybody thinks they deserve it, everybody thinks they want it and most people really don't enjoy it once they get it.","It takes a very strange person to enjoy fame, with all the by-products that come with it. It's not necessarily a thrill.","I became an actor, and because I had success as an actor, I became famous. I was acting for quite a while before I got famous; television made me famous. I guess that it's television that is responsible for everybody's desire to be famous.","Life is supposed to get tough.","The greatest sin is judgment without knowledge.","No day-to-day mishaps or indignities can really compromise your sense of self after you've survived a deep tragedy.","Iago is one of the most liked characters in Shakespeare's canon, and he's the most evil, most extraordinarily manipulative person in history. He says the worst, most politically incorrect things, even for the time the play is set in - and yet audiences adore that character.","Actors are observers of human life, of human behavior.","I like audiences and performing and, you know... applause!","For every story you hear that's tragic, there's another that's equally tragic or more so. I think you come to look at it as part of life.","Frasier will always hold a special place in my heart. He's a great character I Ioved playing, and he's still a wonderful part of my life. But he was a lot of work!","I can't say it was challenging for me to shake the image of Frasier. I've been fortunate to have had a very interesting career since the series ended. I think the turning point for me was the show, 'Boss.'","I'm someone who likes to try new things and take on new challenges. I love making movies, but TV is also great. I really enjoy doing both.","I had a kind of romantic notion about being a Hollywood Errol Flynn type.","Gosh, I think faith is a wonderful thing. And I even think religion's a wonderful thing. I know a lot of people want to say, 'Religion's the only reason that man has had any trouble at all,' but you know what? World War I and World War II were not fought because of religious reasons.","I want to speak seventeen languages. When you think like that, you'll be consumed by failure. I'm haunted daily by what I don't know.","There was one thing I loved a little bit more than surfing - and that was acting.","Different things made 'Cheers' and 'Frasier' special. Both of them, though, were honest. It was the old Shakespeare thing: Hold the mirror up to life.","There's almost nothing better than a baguette and a pound of salami.","I have always been a risk taker.","'Frasier' works because we stay focused on the idea that - how he continues to grow. It is not that you are really - the mission is not to try to keep him fresh; the idea is if you naturally put a character in a situation that demands growth of him, then he will remain fresh.","I think of houses as having their own personality.","I think it's important to approach a house in a way that's reflective of the original environment. Maybe I'm a sentimentalist, but I think that certain geographies call out for certain architecture. I like residences that reflect their place.","The first thing I did on television was a PBS thing where I played a priest. It was a Walt Whitman or Carl Sandburg story - I can't quite remember - but I was a turn-of-the-20th-century priest kind of guy. Never saw it; don't know if I was any good or not.","I thought 'Back To You' was a good show. The writers' strike really kind of put an end to that, though, honestly. There were a couple of factors involved, but to start a show and then to have it disappear and not come back for that long... it's just bad form.","My favorite snack is caviar.","I know a lot of people who've lost their siblings and blame themselves.","I'm a walk-on guy. When the director says, 'Action,' I'm on.","I had a kind of romantic notion about being a Hollywood Errol Flynn type. Honestly, I did not get into a lot of bar brawls - but I was always willing to. About the only thing missing from my story is that I haven't had a full knock-down fight in the middle of the Polo Lounge.","I don't really want to go into it, because whenever I say anything about my past now, it becomes a pissing match... but I realised that I had acquiesced, in my 40s, to an idea of 'You know what, maybe this thing that you wanted in your life, maybe it just wasn't important.'","I've said nice things about the people I was with before, but that's what you do.","In camp when I was eight - a bunch of kids threw me outside naked. I got 'em back!","'A Passage To India' by E. M. Forster - It opened my mind to a world I'd never known before.","I cry a lot. I find great solace in it.","I remember the defining moment when I first realised I was famous. I was in Africa staying in the little tent city there by the Masai Mara River. Two guys with spears looked at me and said, 'Frasier?'","That's the trick in this business: if you want longevity, just keep people guessing a little bit.","I hope they find some way to come up with a new story that involves Beast in my timeline.","Tolerance actually does exist on Broadway.","'Macbeth' is a show I'm going to do again someday.","I've got this great home life I want to keep living, and I don't want to neglect it.","I've never really allowed anyone else to tell me whether I'm good or not.","As you wrestle with life... You're going to come out on the other end healed... I've fallen short sometimes, and I've risen pretty high a few times.","It takes me a while to figure things out. I usually have to repeat a lesson or two - maybe three times!","As a Christian, we always fail because we can't become Christ. But I can try to at least emulate the best qualities, even if I may fall short.","I don't tend to warm too well to people that tell me how I'm supposed to think. So, my life in Hollywood - I'm afraid I was destined to be a Republican.","The tone of political assessment has changed. And honestly, the battle for the hearts and minds of the American people has taken on a bit more of a violent and narrow approach.","Do I believe it's possible that some young person, young voting actor, or even older voting member for the Emmys, would sit there and go, 'Yeah, that's a great performance, but oooooh, I just hate everything he stands for?' I don't believe that's possible.","Kayte is breast-feeding, and we do not have a nanny or a trusted baby-sitter at this time, so Faith goes everywhere with us.","You have to know you are in a comedy. You have to know that you are actually allowing the audience to participate on some level. When you go dark and mean it, then you don't let them in.","There are so many people that would be lined up to get their cut that even trying to finance a reboot of 'Frasier' would be nightmarish."],"Keltie Knight":["I didn't have any bridesmaids. Instead, one friend did my hair, another did my makeup, and a third loaned me her shimmering Jimmy Choo wedges!","I always feel the most comfortable in a breezy short summer dress and a pair of ankle boots."],"Kelvin Yu":["Personally, sometimes I'll lament the journey of an Asian-American actor, walking into audition rooms in 1999.","When my dad came here, he came on a scholarship in the late '60s, and he went to Mississippi State. My dad is not a large man. So there's a little Taiwanese guy walking around Mississippi in, like, 1966, and I cannot imagine what that must have been like.","It's interesting because diversity doesn't just happen by garnishing your omelet with a little bit of parsley. Diversity happens because the people that are telling the stories - the writers, directors, storytellers - want to tell their story.","Full disclosure: I've never read 'Eat Pray Love,' nor have I even seen the movie.","My upbringing was definitely piano lessons and homework, just as much as the next Asian kid.","I think diversity has to happen on a storytelling level, not just on a casting level."],"Kem Nunn":["It's hard to make a living as a novelist. My first novel 'Tapping the Source' made quite a splash in Hollywood, and people started asking if I wanted to write scripts. I quickly realized I could make a lot more money that way.","I've continued to write fiction since being in television. TV is a different kind of writing, but it's all writing. It was David Milch of 'Deadwood' who helped me to see it that way. We later collaborated on the short-lived 'John from Cincinnati,' but I'm very proud of the work we did together.","I've always relied a lot on landscape in my books, the atmosphere of a particular place, as well as a fair amount of external action. While writing 'Chance,' it occurred to me that this is the most internal book I've ever written. So much of the action takes place in Chance's head.","My books often involve characters who began in some form of mental isolation, with a feeling of having died to the world. Then they become involved in some kind of action where by necessity they're forced to reengage, to get back into the game of life, as it were. You could say that about 'Chance.'","My 20s were a lost decade. I didn't do much of anything."],"Ken Adam":["Remember, the early '60s in London was something - which must have been like Berlin in the '30s when the arts flourished. You didn't have the differences in class, and so on.","What I felt at that time - we're talking about '61 - was that I couldn't remember seeing a film that reflected the age we were living in.","I'm an incurable romantic, and Casablanca's one of the most romantic pictures I've ever seen - the combination of Bogart and Bergman is just magical.","One thing that I think works in 'Casablanca' and which I've lectured a lot about - in terms of what I've been trying to achieve as a designer - is the film's creation of its own form of reality.","My mother and father were interested in the arts.","I always wanted to design for films.","I have never been sorry to see my sets being struck, provided they are well photographed. They're not works of art but part of making a film.","A studio allows me more freedom. You can create your own sort of reality which is actually more exciting than shooting on location. You can conjure up a complete atmosphere of escapism for the public.","The cinema is there to heighten the imagination; I have always tried to make sure it does so.","The Berlin of the '20s formed the foundation of my future education... the Berlin of the UFA studios, of Fritz Lang, Lubitsch and Erich Pommer. The Berlin of the architects Gropius, Mendelsohn and Mies van der Rohe. The Berlin of the painters Max Libermann, Grosz, Otto Dix, Klee and Kandinsky.","It takes courage to stay young, to make your enthusiasms work for you. Don't let anyone drag you down.","My house is not James Bondish at all. Sorry.","To be successful, you really have to put your ego in the background and try to be diplomatic to achieve what you want to achieve.","With Kubrick and most film directors, they are in complete control, but one can influence them."],"Ken Auletta":["Without vision, even the most focused passion is a battery without a device.","The digital revolution has disrupted most traditional media: newspapers, magazines, books, record companies, radio.","Always point your finger at the chest of the person with whom you are being photographed. You will appear dynamic. And no photo editor can crop you from the picture.","Perhaps the biggest problem in journalism is the cult divide between journalists and corporate owners.","Journalists prize independence - not teamwork.","Poorer people tend to watch more television because they can't afford other diversions.","Passion without focus can lead you astray.","An important reason Google is usually listed among the world's most trusted brands is that it conveys a sense that the user comes first.","Among the enduring truths I keep bumping into when there is the luxury of time to get to know people or institutions, is that their decisions are often made for what are not, strictly speaking, reasons of logic.","Stanford University is so startlingly paradisial, so fragrant and sunny, it's as if you could eat from the trees and live happily forever.","If the Ivy League was the breeding ground for the elites of the American Century, Stanford is the farm system for Silicon Valley."],"Ken Baumann":["I don't eat fast food often, but I love tacos. I could write prophetically about how perfect the taco is.","Growing up, my mom would watch 'Notting Hill' a lot. She loves Hugh Grant.","I love art and I think I was destined to end up in some aspect of the arts.","I would sleep 12 hours a day if I could."],"Ken Blanchard":["The key to successful leadership today is influence, not authority.","Don't quack like a duck, soar like an eagle.","Feedback is the breakfast of champions.","The productivity of a work group seems to depend on how the group members see their own goals in relation to the goals of the organization.","In the past a leader was a boss. Today's leaders must be partners with their people... they no longer can lead solely based on positional power.","People who produce good results feel good about themselves.","Too many leaders act as if the sheep... their people... are there for the benefit of the shepherd, not that the shepherd has responsibility for the sheep.","I absolutely believe in the power of tithing and giving back. My own experience about all the blessings I've had in my life is that the more I give away, the more that comes back. That is the way life works, and that is the way energy works.","For a manager to be perceived as a positive manager, they need a four to one positive to negative contact ratio.","I never use notes, they interfere with me."],"Ken Bruen":["My father believed a real man didn't read, and my parents hoped I'd get some sense and find a job in insurance.","My own life has had so many twists that I keep thinking I'll have one blessing that is not in disguise.","The only book in our home was the Bible. My parents forbade books. They thought I needed help because I wanted to be a writer!","The tourist board have put a bounty on me head, but they like the biz from tourists.","I'd kill to be a poet.","I always had this notion of a noir novel in Galway. The city is exploding, emigration has reversed, and we are fast becoming a cosmopolitan city.","I committed a cardinal sin as a kid. I never spoke, and my mother thought there was something seriously wrong with me. A silent child is regarded as a problem in Ireland, and I just read all the time.","I was a failed actor, but for 25 years, I got to go on stage anyway, and I loved it. I've still got the day job, and the travel bug.","I decided to write books, just to prove to myself that I was still alive, if nothing else.","I had wanted to write English crime novels based on the American hard-boiled style, and for the first two novels about Brixton, the critics didn't actually know I was Irish.","We haven't had crime writers, and for a long time in the Republic, we didn't seem to have a crime problem as such.","Crime fiction is the new rock n' roll.","Because I've been so bad at looking after myself, how would I ever look after a kid? But the old cliche applied: they handed her to me, and my world turned upside down - and I realised I was now going to be vulnerable in more ways than I expected.","After five awful movies, I admitted failure and said I was not cut out to be an actor. But how many people get a chance to live their dream?","Jack Taylor was a private investigator in Galway, which seemed like madness. I used lots of Galway-isms, which seemed like madness, too.","Whenever dark things happen in my life, there is always some dark humour."],"Ken Buck":["I won't use abortion as a litmus test with a pro-choice individual. Someone that is an activist on the abortion issue, I think, goes outside the pale, and I cannot support an activist on the abortion issue.","I think that, you know, this is a different year than most years. We've got to tell the American people that we have to live with less. We have a $13.5 trillion debt. And the only way to do that is an honest campaign with honest people.","When we leave money in the hands of taxpayers, they buy things, they pay taxes, they grow government.","I think women as well as men are concerned about jobs and the economy and spending and, and other issues. They're concerned that when their kids graduate from college they have an economy and they have a future in this country and they, they have the same opportunity that we've had and our grandparents have had.","I don't believe in deadlines, I don't believe in telling the enemy when we're going to withdraw.","I'm coming to Washington, D.C., to do the people's work. And the people's work has to do with reducing spending and cutting budgets and, and trying to get a grip on the size of government.","I think we need to make sure that we are putting Social Security on a sustainable path. It's absolutely something that the federal government is going to be involved in, in the future.","Well, we certainly need to raise the retirement age. I've told my 19-year-old and my 22-year-old that they're not going to be getting retirement benefits at age 62.","We've got to make sure our younger workers understand that as life expectancy increases, the retirement date for benefits increases also.","If 'extreme' means that I am unwilling to go to Washington, D.C., and do what President Obama tells me, then so be it. But I am certainly not going to Washington, D.C. to represent the interests of D.C. I'm going there to represent Colorado values.","I agree with the idea that there is a separation of church and state. That teachers should not be leading prayer - a particular kind of prayer in classrooms.","What I have said is that I think the federal government and we as a society have come too far in trying to separate good organizations that perform good functions for people just based on the fact one has a religious association and one doesn't.","I disagree strongly with the concept of separation of church and state. It was not written into the Constitution.","While we have a Constitution that is very strong in the sense that we are not gonna have a religion that's sanctioned by the government, it doesn't mean that we need to have a separation between government and religion.","I have said that I am in favor of personhood as a concept. I am not taking a position on any of the state amendments, and I have said over and over again - and it has been reported over and over again - that I am not in favor of banning any common forms of birth control in Colorado or in the United States.","I think it's wrong to compromise your values to fit in with the social climate in Washington, D.C. When it comes to spending, I'm not compromising. I don't care who, what, when or where, I'm not compromising.","I don't support getting rid of Social Security.","I am who I am. I'm going to speak my mind.","In my political career, I'd like to see a constitutional balanced budget amendment.","In my life, I'd like to play more golf and, and get a decent handicap.","Principles are the most important thing to me. One of the things I think my dad taught me was there are people who accept the world they live in and there are people who change the world they live in. I don't accept my circumstances.","To me, it is clear that the Social Security program is constitutional.","A consumption tax, a national sales tax makes some sense. But I think that if we move towards a Fair Tax, if we move towards a national sales tax, we have to make sure that we do away with the income tax.","The corporate income tax, in particular, is a tax that puts American corporations at a disadvantage.","I don't believe that the science is settled on man-made climate change. And so - while I live in Colorado - you see where I live. I love the environment. And - and I want to make sure we do everything we can to protect the environment. I don't want government to put artificial standards on us."],"Ken Burns":["The flame is not out, but it is flickering.","I never, ever want to apologize for a film. If it's bad I'll say it's my fault. And that's what I can say so far in all the films that I've done, that if you don't like it, it's entirely my fault.","I think we too often make choices based on the safety of cynicism, and what we're lead to is a life not fully lived. Cynicism is fear, and it's worse than fear - it's active disengagement.","I subscribe to William Faulkner's' view that history is not just about what we were before but who we are now.","Good history is a question of survival. Without any past, we will deprive ourselves of the defining impression of our being.","When you are editing, the final master is Aristotle and his poetics. You might have a terrific episode, but if people are falling out because there are just too many elements in it, you have to begin to get rid of things.","I treat the photograph as a work of great complexity in which you can find drama. Add to that a careful composition of landscapes, live photography, the right music and interviews with people, and it becomes a style.","Jazz is a very accurate, curiously accurate accompaniment to 20th century America.","I enjoy total creative control right now. Nobody tells me to make it longer, shorter, better, sexier, more violent, whatever.","In a sense I've made the same film over and over again. In all of them I've asked, 'Who are we as Americans?","Louis Armstrong is quite simply the most important person in American music. He is to 20th century music (I did not say jazz) what Einstein is to physics.","I am passionately interested in understanding how my country works. And if you want to know about this thing called the United States of America you have to know about the Civil War.","I began to feel that the drama of the truth that is in the moment and in the past is richer and more interesting than the drama of Hollywood movies. So I began looking at documentary films.","I have made all my films for my children with the exception of my first film because my oldest daughter wasn't born when I was making the film about the Brooklyn Bridge.","I have made a film about jazz that tries to look through jazz to see what it tells us about who we are as a people. I think that jazz is a spectacularly accurate model of democracy and a kind of look into our redemptive future possibilities.","Like a layer on a pearl, you can't specifically identify the irritant, the moment of the irritant, but at the end of the day, you know you have a pearl.","I think my expectations for myself are much more severe and much more direct. You can't work on a film for six years without being your own toughest critic. So you can't really be distracted by the expectations based on your previous performance.","You don't work on something for six years and be blind to the myriad of other approaches.","The stories from 1975 on are not finished and there is no resolve. I could spend 50 hours on the last 25 years of jazz and still not do it justice.","You need, as a historian, essential triangulation from your subject and the only way you get that triangulation is through time.","When a documentary filmmaker, working in the style that I do, suggests that there has been a shooting ratio of 40 hours to every one hour of finished film, that doesn't mean that the other 39 are bad.","By its very nature, no one person can ever be the center of jazz.","I read cover to cover every jazz publication that I could and in the New York Times, every single day reading their jazz reviews even though I didn't put them in the films. I wanted to know what is going on.","You can learn as much about the history from reading about the present as you can vice versa, that is learning about the present through history, which is what I do for a living.","You know, you meet some people, and do a lot of interviews, and you come across a Buck O'Neill and you know you are going to know him for the rest of your life. The same thing happened with Curt Flood.","One of the things I really like about Ford's films is how there is always a focus on the way characters live, and not just the male heroes.","I grew up certain for a while that I was going to be an anthropologist, until film turned my head.","I don't use composers. I research music the way I research the photographs or the facts in my scripts.","I record all of my music with authentic instruments in a studio before we start editing, doing many, many versions. The music shapes the film as we edit so it has an organic relationship to the content.","In most films music is brought in at the end, after the picture is more or less locked, to amplify the emotions the filmmaker wants you to feel.","The genius of our country is improvisation, and jazz reflects that. It's our great contribution to the arts.","The way I work, the interview never becomes larger than the person being interviewed.","History is malleable. A new cache of diaries can shed new light, and archeological evidence can challenge our popular assumptions.","I think the problem with a lot of the fusion music is that it's extremely predictable, it's a rock rhythm and the solos all play the same stuff and they play it over and over again and there's a certain musical virtuosity involved in it.","I can understand why some of these drummers and bass players become cult figures with all of their equipment and the incredible amount of technique they have. But there's very little that I think satisfies you intellectually or emotionally.","Wynton told us that Miles sold out, just wanted to make more money, just wanted to sell more records. I don't believe that Miles sold out but I'm not in a position to say.","To say that an artist sells out means that an artist is making a conscious choice to compromise his music, to to weaken his music for the sake of commercial gain.","We're having a hard time understanding where jazz is going. What happened to jazz?","A jazz beat is a dynamic changing rhythm.","History's just been made for sale to an inside deal."],"Ken Calvert":["We should not blur the lines between legal and illegal immigrants. Millions of people around the world have gone through the process to come here legally and they followed the rules that required them to pay a fee, learn English, and learn about American history and government.","The measure would set criminal penalties, the same as those that would apply if harm or death happened to the pregnant woman, for those who harm a fetus.","The bill would ban human cloning, and any attempts at human cloning, for both reproductive purposes and medical research. Also forbidden is the importing of cloned embryos or products made from them.","In addition the bill would expand an existing law 'conscience clause' that protects physician training programs that refuse to provide training for abortion procedures.","The Child Custody Protection Act makes it a federal crime to transport a minor across state lines for the purpose of obtaining an abortion.","The public should always be notified as soon as possible in the event of a leak or other emergency at a nuclear facility.","We can practice tolerance while still holding true to cultural values that protect the institution of marriage as a union between only a man and a woman."],"Ken Caminiti":["It's no secret what's going on in baseball. At least half the players are using steroids.","I didn't think I was going to play that day. I'd have to thank the training staff for getting me on the field that day. They made a bigger deal than I thought it was.","I had a real good thing going for me, and I got sidetracked. It doesn't have to be that way. It doesn't have to be drugs. It doesn't have to be alcohol. That part of my life is over."],"Ken Cuccinelli":["It's hard to make me speechless.","It is my opinion that a local school board cannot impose a mandatory fee on students taking advanced placement courses for the required taking of the Advanced Placement Examination.","I don't mind knife fights. I just want the knives to come to the front.","Incarcerating non-violent offenders in the same population as more dangerous criminals has the effect of inculcating the former into a culture of criminality common among the latter, making them more of a risk to public safety upon release than when they originally went in.","One of my unique features as a politician is that I am so blunt and so forthright, and I put my cards on the table to such a degree people aren't used to, that there's nothing left to hide.","People in this country don't realize how tyrannical the Left is. It is phenomenally intolerant of any views other than its own, and it must label them as bad, evil, malodorous in some way.","The first thing in my oath is to uphold and protect the U.S. Constitution.","Giving public sanction to homosexual marriage ends up redefining marriage, and it's certain to harm children.","What we can do where we live is advocate again to bring back to life the 10th Amendment, to bring back to life those boundaries in our constitutional system that were supposed to be the critical checks in the checks and balances system. Without them, we lose - gradually, we lose our liberty.","I don't mind fighting as long as it's for a good cause.","Because the Advanced Placement Examination test is the required end-of-course examination, it cannot reasonably be viewed as a service or program for which a fee may be levied.","An e-cigarette does not function in manner of a traditional cigarette because it functions electrically rather than via combustion of a material such as tobacco.","My view is that homosexual acts - not homosexuality, but homosexual acts - are wrong. They're intrinsically wrong. And I think in a natural-law-based country, it's appropriate to have policies that reflect that... They don't comport with natural law.","Senator Cruz has done well in Republican states.","If a corporation can express opinions and be protected in doing so by the First Amendment, then there's no reason logically one wouldn't think they could undertake to enjoy the other rights protected under the First Amendment.","Every liberal position is built on a fallacy.","If you give me enough questions honestly answered, I can get you to the hollow core of any liberal position.","I like being home for dinner.","I was an attorney general. That was - that matters to me, and if you won't obey your own rules, there's no reason to think you'll obey any others.","I think it was in 1971 or 1974, the Supreme Court ruled marriage is not a subject that the federal government can exercise jurisdiction over, including the courts. To do that, we would need an amendment to the Constitution.","The one thing that even my staunchest opponents will admit is I'm a straight shooter and that I'm a man of my word.","I don't play golf with presidents.","I don't go hunting with kings and princes.","I have a serious concern about middle-class families being able to afford college.","I would rather we limited - for the sake of transparency - we limited the number of taxes that we had and we were right up front about what they are, how much they are, and so forth.","I don't believe you back off being pro-life: You don't stop being pro-life because they say you're mean because you're pro-life.","Conservatives are the heirs to the Founders' vision. But we have to act like it.","I look Italian, but I act Irish.","I'm more of an engineer with a law degree than I am a lawyer with an engineering degree in terms of how I think.","I have been approached to consider an appointment to the Virginia Supreme Court. I am humbled and honored to be considered for such a position, but it is not something that my wife and I have previously contemplated.","Put simply, no one in state government can create new specially protected classes except the General Assembly with the concurrence of the Governor.","One of the beauties of the Tea Party movement - and the many, many like-minded citizens that don't participate in the Tea Party movement - is the fact that it is independent.","I do think a focus on fiscal restraint is a central element of the Tea Party, and thank goodness for it!","Elections are about choices.","Am I happy with the choice? No I'm not. But I'm going to make my choice, and I expect to vote for Donald Trump.","One of the challenges for lawyers can be explaining, first of all, what the legal issue is and, second, its significance. And both of those are important.","When one person does something, you look like an outlier. And whether it makes sense or not, the states get a certain level of respect from the courts that other people don't.","When you file an amicus brief, and you represent a state, the court reads your brief. It is a powerful position to make the legal assault from.","There's some bells you can't unring.","I ran for attorney general to be attorney general.","For all the criticism of me, there's one thing you won't hear anybody say, and that's that I've pulled the wool over anyone's eyes.","There are just some things about being president that are difficult.","Competition's a good thing.","I love algebra. Love it.","My wife's a gardener. I'd put Astroturf down everywhere, but I get outvoted one to one every year.","I will be the first to admit that I've made my own mistakes when it comes to Virginia's disclosure requirements.","Unlike in Washington, Virginia's leaders don't run from serious problems. We tackle them.","One of the reasons Americans hold Washington in such low regard is the perception that nothing ever gets done. Whatever the issue - no matter how urgent - they always seem to be 'working on it.'","Ethics reform is about restoring the public trust. When that is in doubt, nothing is more important than restoring it.","Telling the public, 'We'll get to it later,' is inadequate. That's what the federal government does.","I learned as a mascot that rules don't really apply to you. As long as you don't go crazy with that. You want to go be the 12th man on a football play, they might have an objection, but otherwise, if you stay out of the way of the game, you can do most anything.","We need all the transportation options that we can get in Virginia - especially options where the private sector carries all the risk and all the cost.","I guess blustery liberal Republicans flock together.","The media is really failing the American people.","I'm the most pro-liberty elected official statewide in my lifetime. It isn't even a close call, so for people who care about protecting liberty, there's never been - again, in my lifetime in Virginia - a statewide elected official who's been as aggressive and consistent about doing that as I have.","Strategies that do show evidence of effectiveness include policing that's focused on high-risk individuals or geographic areas, and/or deterrence-based approaches that hold entire gangs accountable should individual members engage in criminal behavior.","What to do about these increases in crime? Plenty of laws already exist to punish violent criminals, and research questions the level of correlation between longer sentences and lower crime rates.","We can agree that keeping serious criminals in prison is an effective means of preserving public safety, but we must also recognize that the axiom of 'putting people in jail and throwing away the key' does not apply to all offenders universally and can actually be counterproductive.","Even without mandatory sentences, judges are still capable of levying tough penalties for serious offenses - and just as in states like Texas that have 'tough on crime' reputations, this can be done without jeopardizing public safety.","There's nothing conservative about allowing ourselves to become so inured to a 'tough on crime' frame of mind that we would abandon tested alternatives that can yield better outcomes.","Let's help take back our country with our wallets, and don't forget to contact your senators and congressman to let them know that you don't want amnesty for illegal aliens, that you want them to restore our borders and our sovereignty.","In the Republican Party, we talk all the time about the importance of free markets and open competition. It seems to me that if we don't practice what we preach, we won't have much credibility with others.","I have not always held the position I do today on the life issue.","There was a time that I questioned the government's role in abortion.","I didn't run for office to make friends.","Every time you blow the whistle, half the people are going to be mad at you.","When you run on something definitive and then win by a significant margin, you have a mandate.","I don't get to sue just because I don't like something.","I start with a concern about the growth of federal government. I start with a perspective concerned about the growth of that power, and containing it within the bounds of the Constitution.","We have a battle over the fundamentals of our country.","On the issues the Tea Party cares about, I land right in their bull's-eye.","A media-only campaign has its advantages, but it also has its very severe disadvantages.","I absolutely believe that President Obama was born in the United States. I don't buy into the claims that he wasn't.","The very purpose of Clinton's server was to intentionally retain documents and materials - all emails and attachments - on the server in her house, including classified materials.","It borders on inconceivable that Clinton didn't know that the emails she received - and, more obviously, the emails that she created, stored and sent with the server - would contain classified information.","Simply being secretary of state didn't allow Clinton to authorize herself to deviate from the requirements of retaining and transmitting classified documents, materials and information.","The truth is our friend.","We need to move back toward a free market.","We don't have a free market in health care. We need to connect customers up with the cost of care. And to drive innovation that way.","In Virginia, we want to have our own opportunity to control our own destiny, control our own market.","I was one of the founding members of State Legislators for Legal Immigration.","I want very much to see some sort of compromise reached in the area of immigration... so that we could move on to other issues.","I've always been one of those folks who think competition is actually a good thing. And if we're going to preach it as a party, we need to practice it.","It is hard to argue that the conservative movement is not having success.","We are moving the debate in a more limited government direction. And in a more rule of law direction, a more conservative direction.","When Eric Cantor lost, being the only majority leader in history to lose a primary, that was pretty - and still is - earth-shattering in Virginia and across the country.","Really, given that God does judge nations, it's amazing that abortion has run as far and foully as it has without what I would consider to be a greater imposition of judgment on this country. Who knows what the future holds?","The notion that those of us that are pro-life because we love children - is that so terrible? Really? Is that so terrible?","They spend us into the dirt and lie like crazy, and, my gosh, I have never seen an opponent who just lies like he's taking a drinking of water like Terry McAuliffe. It is nothing to him.","I was the first attorney general to court to fight Obamacare - about 30 minutes after the president signed the bill."],"Ken Curtis":["I'd stop in the middle of a gun fight and sing a song.","I joined Tommy Dorsey at the Paramount Theater in New York as a singer. I replaced Frank Sinatra.","We did some jumping at the start of the show. We went out without telling anyone - and the studio liked to kill us. They were threatened with cancellation of their production insurance.","In this business you break a leg and 150 other people are out of work while production is shut down. It's not like you were an accountant and could still work with your leg in a cast.","The scenes in the show were filmed with a crew of really excellent stunt jumpers, but we had the feel of the parachutes, so we could be more realistic in the roles.","I wouldn't care if they tattoo Festus all over. He's been good to me.","I'm really proud of Gunsmoke. We put on a good show every week - one that families could all watch together without offending anyone.","I really miss Gunsmoke. It was like losing my whole family.","I've thought about doing other dramatic roles besides westerns, but I grew up in the West and I know the West."],"Ken Dodd":["If I get a hard audience they are not going to get away until they laugh. Those seven laughs a minute - I've got to have them.","I told the Inland Revenue I didn't owe them a penny because I lived near the seaside."],"Ken Follett":["World War II is the greatest drama in human history, the biggest war ever and a true battle of good and evil. I imagine writers will continue to get stories from it, and readers will continue to love them, for many more years.","I went and looked at one of these great cathedrals one day, and I was blown away by it. From there I became interested in how cathedrals were built, and from there I became interested in the society that built the medieval cathedral. It occurred to me at some point that the story of the building of a cathedral could be a great popular novel.","Without books I would not have become a vivacious reader, and if you are not a reader you are not a writer.","Thrillers have been traditionally very masculine books; the women characters often rather decorative.","The research is the easiest. The outline is the most fun. The first draft is the hardest, because every word of the outline has to be fleshed out. The rewrite is very satisfying.","I don't think there's any great mystery to writing female characters, so long as you talk to them. If you lived in a monastery and never met any women, maybe it would be difficult.","Listen, I wrote 10 unsuccessful books before I broke through, so I'm looking all the time to keep my books fascinating. I want to write what people want to read, not push any message.","There is a real connection between Philosopy and fiction.","Be a perfectionist.","I enjoy learning technical details.","Culture clash is terrific drama.","Most of my stories have some basis in fact.","A very good editor is almost a collaborator.","Movies have influenced all writers, not just thriller writers.","There is no point in asking a man a question until you have established whether he has any reason to lie to you.","The CIA's research program is described in a book called The Search for the Manchurian Candidate.","The thriller is the most popular literary genre of the 20th century.","An awful lot of thriller writers write women rather badly. So just doing it OK gets a lot of credit.","With hindsight, we see that the Soviet Union never had a chance of world domination, but we didn't know that then.","My favorite period is World War II, and I'm in the middle of writing my fourth novel set in that era.","I use a professional researcher in New York who does all the legwork, all that stuff which would take me days and weeks of calling, waiting for people to call back.","When I'm writing a woman character, I don't think, 'What would a woman do?' I just think, 'What would this character do in this situation?'","In my books, women often solve the problem. Even if the woman is not the hero, she's a strong character. She does change the plot. She'll often rescue the male character from some situation.","James Bond is quite serious about his drinks and clothing and cigarettes and food and all that sort of thing. There is nothing wry or amused about James Bond.","For success, the author must make the reader care about the destiny of the principals, and sustain this anxiety, or suspense, for about 100,000 words.","We all now tell stories by cutting from one dramatic scene to the next, whereas Victorian novelists felt free to write long passages of undramatic summary.","I like to create imaginary characters and events around a real historical situation. I want readers to feel: OK, this probably didn't happen, but it might have.","There was a very serious communist strain among American intellectuals before the war. America was a more tolerant place in those days, and Communists were not treated as pariahs. That ended with the McCarthy era.","Well, for people who want to write best sellers, the best advice I can give is to say that the novel has to engage the reader emotionally.","I read mostly fiction, a lot of 19th-century novels.","I am very fond of Edith Wharton. She's quite high brow but also a great storyteller. My favorite is 'The House of Mirth.' I also like 'The Reef.'","I have quite a few different Bibles. Having rejected my parents' religion, I still think the King James Bible is the most important work of literature in English. None of us can help being influenced by it.","It's great that in the German language I've sold almost 30 million books. Isn't that amazing?","I wanted to be some kind of captain of industry. Then I wanted to be in advertising, and then I wanted to be a newspaper reporter.","I started writing stories in my spare time.","I'm a great planner, so before I ever write chapter 1, I work out what happens in every chapter and who the characters are. I usually spend a year on the outline.","I wake up with the story in my head, so I really like to be at my desk about five minutes after I wake up. So I don't get dressed. I put on a bathrobe, I make tea and sit at my desk.","One of the hardest things for me, now that I'm famous, is finding people who can read my stuff and give me an honest critique.","After a certain point, most people, including editors, will tell you everything you do is great.","With the World War II era, there's so much written material to draw on. When you go back to the 14th century, you have to imagine more.","I want to tell a story that makes the reader always want to see what will happen next.","I aim to be translucent, so you don't notice the words, just their meaning. I haven't much insight into people's motivations.","People are much more complicated in real life, but my characters are as subtle and nuanced as I can make them. But if you say my characters are too black and white, you've missed the point. Villains are meant to be black-hearted in popular novels. If you say I have a grey-hearted villain, then I've failed.","I might not be a good socialist, any more than I'm a good Christian, but I am one.","I like reading history, and actually most authors enjoy the research part because it is, after all, easier than writing.","I start with the history, and I ask myself, 'What are the great turning points? What are the big dramatic scenes that are essential to telling the story?'"],"Ken Goldberg":["We're fascinated with robots because they are reflections of ourselves.","Epistemology has always been affected by technologies like the telescope and the microscope, things that have created a radical shift in how we sense physical reality.","Our robots are signing up for online learning. After decades of attempts to program robots to perform complex tasks like flying helicopters or surgical suturing, the new approach is based on observing and recording the motions of human experts as they perform these feats.","'Bloom' is basically the idea that all flesh is grass, and that we can look at natural plant growth and organic material as outgrowths of the Earth.","The Web meant that I didn't have to schlep a whole bunch of stuff to a museum and fight with all their constraints and make something that, in the end, only 150 people would actually get out to see. Instead, I could put something together in my lab and make it accessible to the world.","What was really interesting to me about 'The Telegarden' was this idea of connecting the physical world, the natural world, and the social world through the Internet.","I was interested in the questions that come up when the Internet gives you access not just to JSTOR libraries and to digital information, but also to things that are live and dynamic and organic in some way.","Artificial creatures date back to the ancient Chinese and Greeks. Renaissance automata were designed primarily to entertain, reflecting the value placed on leisure.","As humans embrace new forms of social media to keep connected with friends and colleagues, our robots are becoming increasingly sociable."],"Ken Ham":["What you believe about who you are, where you came from, affects your whole worldview.","If God used evolution, God came from an ape.","While the Bible's account of the flood is one of judgment, it is also one of mercy and salvation. Likewise, our future full-size evangelistic Noah's Ark will honor the Bible as God's word and not treat it as a pagan fable.","While the Ark Encounter will be able to accommodate 16,000 guests per day, our consultant's research has shown that we could possibly expect more than that during the first few weeks of opening, especially during the summer time frame.","Based on the Bible, I believe that all the land animals were made on day six, and Adam and Eve were made on day six, and people try to make fun of us for believing that dinosaurs lived with people, but there are a lot of animals living today that evolution says lived with dinosaurs.","No one will ever convince me that the word of God is not true.","What I believe about the young age of the earth comes out of taking the Bible as written. And I've said numerous times over the years that the age of the earth, for example, is not a salvation issue but an authority issue.","Many dinosaurs were smaller than chickens.","When I went to high school in Australia, I was exposed to textbooks that outlined evolutionary ideas - such as ape-like creatures turning into people. I recognized the conflict between evolutionary ideas and a literal reading of the book of Genesis.","For students, the evolution-creation discussion can be a useful exercise, for it can help develop their critical thinking skills.","Most students are presented only with the evolutionary belief system in their schools, and they are censored from hearing challenges to it. Let our young people understand science correctly and hear both sides of the origins issue and then evaluate them.","If you look only as Genesis as an allegory, you have a major problem, because if it's an allegory, then tell me who our ancestor was? If Abraham was real, then from Abraham if Adam isn't real, if it's just an allegory, it's just a story, then what's the real Adam who really fell in a garden and really sinned? Where did we come from?","There's a slippery slope in regard to authority. If you say that the history in Genesis is not true, then you can just take man's ideas as true. When you go outside of Scripture, why shouldn't you just reinterpret what marriage means? So our emphasis is on the slippery slope regarding authority.","Evolution is the idea some people have to explain life without God.","While the Bible's account of the flood is one of judgment, it is also one of mercy and salvation.","No apparent, perceived, or claimed evidence in any field, including history and chronology, can be valid if it contradicts the Scriptural record.","Christians are increasingly being punished by the government for acting on their sincerely held religious beliefs about marriage that are based on the standard of Scripture.","The Bible makes it clear that Adam's sin affected the whole universe. This means that any aliens would also be affected by Adam's sin, but because they are not Adam's descendants, they can't have salvation.","Our public schools arbitrarily define science as explaining the world by natural processes alone. In essence, a religion of naturalism is being imposed on millions of students. They need to be taught the real nature of science, including its limitations.","There's been an incredible censorship in America and throughout the world, but particularly in America where students aren't even allowed to critically think about evolution, the issue of origins; they are not allowed to hear other points of view; they are taught incorrectly about science and taught that evolution is fact.","One of the problems with compromise in one area of Scripture is where do you stop compromising? If Christians accept the idea of human evolution, then why not accept the idea that our sinful tendencies are really just evolved tendencies?","What is sad to me is not what Bill Nye thinks about me. What I found really unfortunate is that after presenting my stand on God's Word, there were a number of Christians who were more complimentary of Bill Nye than of me because Bill Nye was defending evolution and billions of years.","I was brought up in a Christian home in Australia with a father who was very bold about his faith.","I was brought up in a home environment where I was taught to think critically and was encouraged to seek answers to questions about my faith.","The Creation Museum uses fossils to present evidence that there was a global catastrophe, Noah's Flood, that killed and preserved the remains of creatures all over the earth.","Anti-Christian ideology has permeated much of the secular news media, and so often Biblical Christians are mocked, misrepresented or attacked for what they believe by anti-Christian agenda driven reporters.","Our young people - and adults - should be aware that considerable dissent exists in the scientific world regarding the validity of molecules-to-man evolution.","The public schools tend to teach little kids from when they are very young about the whole universe without God and that God cannot be in science. They are indoctrinating children in an atheistic religious view of things.","The doctrine of marriage depends on Genesis being true. If there's an absolute authority, and if God's the Creator, He made one man and one woman. Jesus came and said that marriage is between a man and woman. If Genesis is not true, we're just animals, and marriage is just whatever you want to make it to be.","We are not saying that if you believe in evolution that you can't be a Christian, not at all. Because the Bible says that by grace you are saved. You don't save yourself. It is by confessing the Lord Jesus and that he was rose from the dead that you are saved.","There is no such thing as 'separation of church and state.' Reporters continue to promote this fallacy and scare Christians out of standing up for their beliefs.","Christians are increasingly being punished for the free exercise of their faith and for standing on God's Word and holding to biblical convictions about sin. This is especially apparent with the gay lobby.","'Noah' is an insult to Bible-believing Christians, an insult to the character of Noah and, most of all, an insult to the God of the Bible. As a result, I believe Hollywood will have a much harder time in marketing future biblically-themed movies to Christians.","Jesus did not become the 'GodKlingon' or the 'GodMartian'! Only descendants of Adam can be saved. God's Son remains the 'Godman' as our Savior.","Sadly, when pastors choose to neglect controversial issues, they do great damage to the spiritual growth of their congregates. We have generations of young people in our churches who simply believe what the world believes on social and moral issues, and they don't think biblically on these matters.","Pope Francis is not the first religious leader who has endorsed evolution and the Big Bang, but he is certainly one of the most influential."],"Ken Harrelson":["In baseball you hit your home run over the right-field fence, the left-field fence, the center-field fence. Nobody cares. In golf everything has got to be right over second base.","In a blind town, the one-eyed man is king.","I have my detractors, no doubt about it. I look at it as a compliment.","Toughest job in baseball is the general manager. Second toughest is the hitting coach.","I'm a big boy, and I'm a tough guy."],"Ken Hensley":["It is hard to understand addiction unless you have experienced it.","I know why I am here and my only real focused goal is to live each day to the fullest and to try and honor God and be an encouragement to others. What the future holds is firmly in God's hands, and I am very happy about that!","The past has infinite value if one learns from it.","People often forget this - a vinyl album could only contain a maximum of 20 minutes per side!","Visible Faith is an expression of my Christian faith which must be visible to be real! I gave the name to the collection of musicians who worked with me on the record.","I have never learned to read or write music so I am not a virtuoso musician like the others you mentioned. I am completely unable to play like them because I never learned classical music, I just developed my own crazy style!","THE GODS was my first professional band and I learned a lot during that time. It was very cool playing with so many great musicians as it helped me to learn.","I actually never knew Peter Green but I do respect his early work very much.","It was both exciting and frustrating to work with an orchestral group.","When we were making vinyl records we had a lot of time limitations for each record so songs were left off for a number of reasons. Now, with CDs, much more music can be included.","When I left HEEP I didn't know what I wanted! It took me a long time to adjust to life away from the band and the only thing I knew was that I didn't want to repeat my mistakes!","It is always encouraging and kind when people say nice things about my work but I know that it is not me that did it then and it is not me that is doing it now. It is God living in me and for that I will always be grateful.","The band projects just took natural priority. I didn't really have a solo career, just wanted to share the music in another way and to learn more about writing, recording, etcetera.","I lived in an area where there were a lot of rock musicians, and we got together regularly in our studios.","I didn't know that you were supposed to tune the guitar to an open chord, and I learned to play slide with a normal tuning. I think it's a little more melodic that way and doesn't sound so bluesy. Of course, if I could play like David Lindley or Ry Cooder, I'd be a happy man!","All of us would like for everybody to be the kind of person we want them to be.","I am, first of all, a Christian and, secondly, a person with very very serious personal opinion, so I'm motivated by many many things and, certainly, not by the need or desire to satisfy other people's ideas of who I am.","If you want to capitulate to what commercial needs are, you can always be commercially valuable, but I'm not interested in being that.","I always write lyrics first and the rhythm and the melody come from the lyrics. It always comes from the lyrics: words have rhythm and words have melody."],"Ken Hill":["Minds are like flowers. If you let it sit there without soaking anything up, it will dry up.","The human voice sounds thicker with a chorus and reverb than a dry signal.","Childhood is a promise that is never kept.","Writing a song is much like being an author. Yes, we all have tools to write (everyone has a brain I hope!), but that doesn't all of a sudden make us best selling authors.","The prime goal of an author is the same as a musician, which is to emotionally connect with the reader in some way or another.","Composers, like authors, have a lot in common. Our main goal is to connect with the listener emotionally.","If our main goal is to connect emotionally, we should want to have as many tools as we possibly can to achieve that goal. The more abilities that we have, the more choices we can make musically.","If you are making music for other people, you will have to be aware of how people relate to it.","Music is an art form. It is a way to wordlessly communicate.","I have come up with very creative ideas that really didn't work with the song I was currently composing.","The more I do in my life, the more I can write music about new experiences.","Sometimes just getting out of the house and doing something you haven't done in a long time (or never done!) can open up the doors to musical inspiration.","Music is an art form too. Sometimes other forms of art can be inspiring to the musician.","Mistakes can be good things, because it is an unexpected thing.","Sometimes I will click on a random sequence of notes- not to actually use it in a song, but to see if I can find maybe a simple pattern that I can build off of.","Location is a very important aspect to songwriting.","Sometime I write a song off a central idea, instead of emotion.","The most important thing is that you like the music.","Food is your body's fuel. Without fuel, your body wants to shut down.","Hooks need to be predictable and not predictable at the same time.","Music is about textures as well as melody.","People don't have fun making music all the time."],"Ken Howard":["The reason I got into this union was to bring people together.","How we take care of our animals is a very good indicator of how we are doing as a society. It is symbolic of how, as human beings, we go about treating each other.","The obvious challenge to both SAG and AFTRA is remaining current in a rapidly changing industry. We have to be nimble, pro-active, and unified, and we've got to bring compelling value to future members.","Some people really think I'm an ex-pro player.","Singing was always the thing - I played some leads in musicals. Then when I went to college, I joined a singing group.","I was involved with sports and student government, the regular stuff. I liked movies and all, but I did love the singing and putting on musicals, and I was always comfortable with that. I liked it.","I never mind going in for an audition for something.","After 'The White Shadow' was over, I did some more work, but then I wound up taking a year off to teach at Harvard. It afforded me the chance to have a variegated career - a very interesting one.","I've always been attracted to independent, outspoken women.","I was from a town called Manhasset, very nice town out on the North Shore of Long Island, New York, but there was a little area, predominantly black population, and it was a small school. I played on the basketball team when I was a junior, and I was the only white guy on the starting five, the top seven actually, and we were really good.","Bobby Cremins really knows basketball, and he is a good man, too.","IMDb publishes the actual dates of birth of thousands of actors without their consent, most of them not celebrities but rank-and-file actors whose names are unknown to the general public.","Sometimes you wonder if television is really affecting the culture.","I'm really happy to have been part of spreading the game of basketball and growing the game in a place like Turkey.","Pension and health benefits are a cornerstone of union protection. When actors' work is split between two unions, that protection is weakened or, in the worst cases, eliminated. That's not acceptable, and it's one of many reasons merging SAG and AFTRA makes sense.","Good coaches, as we all know, can have amazing influences on boys.","I have no theories about the divorce rate or things like that, but it does occur to me that dealing with kids and their problems can be real binding glue. It keeps you out of the range of too much ego.","I've always been entranced when it came to musical comedy; it's probably my favorite thing. It's a real true American form, and it's big, like Shakespeare big, when it's right. It's loud, and it's big: you have to be ready vocally and physically. It can bring people to their feet and can be as thrilling as a circus.","Unifying the legacy SAG and AFTRA contracts was essential, and I am very pleased that we were able to achieve that.","When television gets in trouble is when it forgets that it all begins with the written word.","I was raised on Long Island. There were a lot of cops and firefighters who lived there.","There's a certain kind of guy, a certain kind of humor, that goes with Irish cops and firemen.","Service that benefits the community and those in need is an act that betters us all.","As one union, SAG-AFTRA will support a future of great entertainment for all of us.","Sports is a terrific metaphor that's hardly been touched on TV.","I grew up playing for Manhasset High on Long Island on a team with six black guys.","I loved that outrageous, creative style of city ball. 'Logic is the death of art,' they taught me at Yale. Maybe in basketball, too.","Membership First's record is one of conflict, division and, ultimately, failure.","It is my mission to make sure SAG-AFTRA protects our members' ability to do the work they love and to build their lives around it.","The biggest concern for most actors has and always will be getting enough work - it's just part of our profession - but a real change is the idea that performers have to be more versatile and entrepreneurial in their careers.","I love the idea of getting into the mind of the criminal.","Mike Hodge is someone I've counted on for strong, steady leadership from the very start of my union service, and he has never failed to deliver.","One of the things that make actors good is their capacity to listen.","What we are, the experiences we've had, come to the surface.","In a media landscape that has grown in unimaginable ways, there are more projects that have come along now than ever. While the number of projects has grown, many players are vying for that audience.","A lack of diversity permeates our industry, and SAG-AFTRA as an organization is committed to effecting change."],"Ken Jennings":["I remember one of my last shows, the Final Jeopardy! clue was something like 'These two boys' names are top 10 boys' names in the U.S., they both end with the same letter, and they're both names of Jesus' apostles.' Now, obviously that's not a knowable fact.","There's just something hypnotic about maps.","When you make a decision, you need facts. If those facts are in your brain, they're at your fingertips. If they're all in Google somewhere, you may not make the right decision on the spur of the moment.","Even before you understand them, your brain is drawn to maps.","You live overseas, you see these exotic places and you want to know about them.

On any given night, nearly all the contestants know nearly all the answers, so it's just a matter of who masters buzzer rhythm the best.","Knowing lots of answers but being a millisecond slow on the buzzer is indeed very frustrating.","The future is here.","You watch an old 'Jeopardy!' and the categories alone are very plain. 'Poetry,' or 'Movies,' or 'Physics.' If you watch it now, though, there'll be a theme board where the categories are all Hitchcock movies. Lots more jokes, lots more high-concept categories and questions.","The Final Jeopardy! questions seem to be, by design, things you can't know. And so it's not about who knows them, but who can figure them out in thirty seconds.","We don't realize how hard it was to drive anywhere outside the major cities less than a century ago.","I can't relax and sink back in the couch and watch 'Jeopardy!' the way I used to.","People are using GPS systems to find millions of little hidden objects throughout the world - often as simple as a piece of Tupperware hidden in the woods. You go to a website, you get the latitude and longitude to get the specific location of a certain specific hiding space, and then you go there and see if you can find it.","I have condemned my kids to a lifetime of geographic illiteracy.","I would stare at maps of Delaware for hours.","For some reason the most devoted mapheads seem to be kids.","I have always loved maps.","I would read the atlas for pleasure.

But whatever.","Medicine really matured me as a person because, as a physician, you're obviously dealing with life and death issues, issues much more serious than what we're talking about in entertainment. You can't get more serious than life and death. And if you can handle that, you can handle anything.","I grew up in North Carolina, and I grew up on wrestling.","I really realize the more movies I do just how important - it's so cliche when people say it, because everybody says it nowadays - but it's so important to keep it grounded. I totally understand what that means.","I have a very simple approach in career: You work with the people you love.","You just can't take the doctor out of you.","I think everyone's different but in comedy, I try to do my scene to make the director and the other actors laugh. If I can make them laugh and we have the same sensibility, then I'm on the right page.","I wasn't sued out of medicine, I wasn't arbitrated out of the profession.","Sitcom food is by far the tastiest of all showbiz food.","When I finished my residency in New Orleans, I went to L.A. where I would work as a doctor during the day, and then at night I would actually go to The Improv and do standup, all the while kind of cultivating my comedy resume.","There's really no substitute for working hard.

If I'm in a room full of people who aren't, maybe I'm intense.","I haven't been in a position to have the luxury to pick roles for most of my career, so I'm not practiced in that. Usually, when you want to be an actor, you take whatever comes along. If there's an audition, you go for it. If you get the job, you do it - just to get experience, to act, to meet people.","If I'm in a room full of intense people, I'm pretty normal.

I don't know, I don't think of it that way.","I did this thing for HBO called 'Strip Search' with Sidney Lumet, who was one of the best directors I've ever worked with.

Every dystopia is a utopia for somebody else. It just depends where you are. Are you in the class that benefits, or are you in the class that's not?","Whenever you talk about Chinese dragons, emperors, palaces, concubines - they conjure up a whole colonial argle-bargle that has nothing to do with historical reality.","It's true that misunderstanding and lack of understanding are often themes in my fiction, but I am grateful for the moments when true understanding is achieved, especially between writer and reader. It's miraculous.","Translation is an act of recreation.","My metaphor for translation has always been that translation is really a performance art. You take the original and try to perform it, really, in a different medium. Part of that is about interpretation and what you think the author's voice really is.","I'm conscious of the fact that I'm sort of a bridging figure. I have my Chinese literary heritage and cultural background, so I'm comfortable with these things, but at the same time, I have to navigate the Anglo-American tradition, which has a self-centred view of what Asia and what being Chinese means.","Because my writing time has always been very limited, I try to be very choosy about which stories I work on. There are many ideas that would make interesting stories - too many - so it's important to be ruthless and say no to most of them.","I like the law. I like the part that's about reasoning, about persuasion, about telling stories, about trying to build structures that fall within rules.","When I act as a translator, I am really doing a performance for my fellow Anglophone readers in the West.","What tends to happen when people talk about Chinese sci-fi in the West is that there's a lot of projection. We prefer to think of China as a dystopian world that is challenging American hegemony, so we would like to think that Chinese sci-fi is all either militaristic or dystopian. But that's just not the reality of it.","It is not possible to completely eliminate mediation between you as an observer and the history you are trying to understand.","I think male authors who want to try to tackle these issues of representation of women can generally do a better job if they try to question traditional notions of masculinity and the sort of toxic nature of traditional ways of presenting masculinity.","The 'silk' in silkpunk refers not to a source of power, but to an entirely different, expressive technology language.","As a species, we tend to live in environments where our own artifacts dominate. The way we shape our environment and are in turn shaped by it is a key theme in my fiction - indeed, it's a key part of a great deal of science fiction.","Trying to predict the future is a loser's game.","Like steampunk, silkpunk is a blend of science fiction and fantasy. But while steampunk takes its inspiration from the chrome-brass-glass technology aesthetic of the Victorian era, silkpunk draws inspiration from East Asian antiquity.","The evolution of technology is, like the evolution of literature, heavily path-dependent. Culture plays a far more important role in the acceptance, adoption, and spread of technology than many of us are willing to acknowledge.","I still think in a parallel universe, I became a mathematician.","Most of us do not, in fact, read another language, and so when we read a translation, we have no way of knowing what has been changed or added.","There is no way for me to replicate for you what a sentence reads like for a Chinese reader.","It's kind of cool that I know of all this great science fiction being written in China, and most of it is not really well-known in the West.","In general, writers who talk to their colleagues and neighbors constantly about their own writing seem to me pretty insufferable. I try not to be that guy.","I'm very interested in foundational narratives.","There's this long history of colonialism and the colonial gaze when applied to matters related to China. So a lot of conceptions about China in literary representations in the West are things you can't even fight against because they've been there so long that they've become part of the Western imagination of China.","I was not trying to write some sort of serious meditation on war and peace. 'The Grace of Kings' is meant to be a fun book. It's meant to be an epic fantasy.","The Singaporean speculative tradition is different. Singapore doesn't conceive itself as the centre of the world or the one country that's going to save the world, so there's a different tone that comes out in the way speculative fiction is done. That's refreshing to read.","It's okay if you get rejected 20, 30 or 200 times... You don't need everyone to like your story - you just need one person who really likes your story.","If I end up having a novel that sells really well and that allows me to pay for health insurance and mortgage without having to work at a day job, that would be great.","I think the narrative of people being caught between two cultures as immigrants is very harmful. It's exclusionary. It essentially tries to argue that some Americans are more real than others.","My fiction occupies, actually, the very heart of American culture: this eternal question and struggle of what it means to be an American.","I'm often asked how I get ideas for my stories. The answer is there's no single way; every story is different.","Writers are naturally obsessed with books, the tangible artifacts of their labor. Even beyond the text, I love the physicality of books, the possibilities presented by their substance and form.","The novel that an author writes is often not the novel that the reader reads, and most of the 'messages' in a novel are put there by the reader. There's nothing wrong with that, of course. That's how literature functions.","I've been writing long enough to know that fiction, as a rhetorical mode, works very differently from expository writing. If an author has a specific critique about contemporary society in mind, fiction tends not to be the best means to deliver that critique.","We have never had a society that was truly just. Some groups have always benefited at the expense of others.","The 'Grace of Kings' begins as a very dark, complicated world filled with injustices - among them the oppressed position of women - but gradually transforms into something better through a series of revolutions. But since real social change takes a long time, even by the end of the book, only the seeds of deep change have been planted.","The 'Grace of Kings' isn't a narrative about a return to some golden age, to a lost status quo ante. It portrays a dynamic world in transition, where the redistribution of power is messy, morally ambivalent, and only lurches toward more justice.","I am not an expert on Chinese science fiction. I probably know more than anyone else in the West, but that doesn't actually mean I am an expert.","What is fascinating to me is the way I view everything in terms of parallels and connections. When I read about Achilles and Odysseus in Homer's 'Iliad,' I can see parallels in Chinese historical romances, in the way the first emperor of the Han dynasty and his chief rival are portrayed.","Trying to project our expectations and our desires onto the sci-fi being written in China now isn't terribly helpful.","I think that what's unique about sci-fi - at least from the view of a lot of Chinese writers - is that sci-fi is least-rooted in the particular culture that they're writing from.","The idea that somehow the way forward is to abandon the past, to me, is preposterous and both undesirable and unrealistic.","Real history is far more complex and interesting than the simplistic summaries presented in Wikipedia articles. Knowing this allows you to question received wisdom, to challenge 'facts' 'everybody' knows to be true, and to imagine worlds and characters worthy of our rich historical heritage and our complex selves.","Researching real history has taught me to be bolder and more imaginative in building fantasy worlds and writing fantasy characters, to seek out the margins of history and the forgotten tales that illuminate the whole, complex truth of our flawed yet wondrous nature as a species.","For 'The Grace of Kings,' I read Han Dynasty historical records in Classical Chinese, which allowed me to get a sense of the complexity of the politics and the 'surprisingly modern' reactions of the historical figures to recurrent problems of state administration.","The way that China has been described in Western narratives makes it hard to tell a story that will escape the stereotypes and allow people to perceive it fresh.","I was a tax attorney for something like seven years, so I was a tax geek. I was really into it. Tax is one of those things that people think is incredibly boring, but like any science about systems, once you get into it it, becomes incredibly intricate and interesting.","Because I really love tax, tax topics actually feature quite a lot in my fiction of various lengths. I once wrote a science fiction short story centered around the idea of an alien tax code, and the idea that you can understand a society by parsing its tax code.","People who are ambitious - politicians who crave power - think that they're in control of it, but at some point, the movement that they started overtakes them, and they lose the ability to direct things anymore, and they become essentially riders on a wild stallion, and wherever the movement goes, wherever power takes them, they have to go along.","For me, all fiction is about prizing the logic of metaphors - which is the logic of narratives in general - over reality, which is irreducibly random and senseless.","I'm not sure I necessarily have explicit messages.","I don't have a specific message for 'The Grace of Kings' and the sequels in mind other than wanting to challenge some of the source material I was working from as well as some of the assumptions of epic fantasy.","My wife, Lisa, and I both grew up on wuxia - Chinese historical romances. They're kind of analogous to Western epics. They're based on history, just like 'the Iliad' and 'the Odyssey' are based on history, but they're romanticized, and a lot of fantasy elements have been added.","I wanted to make my stories, which are inspired by Asian stories, into something fresh, decontextualized - to give them new life as a new kind of fantasy that isn't so cloying and exotic and strange.","I don't really care that much about genre labels. I tend to write across a variety of different genres.","I certainly have been writing stories that are hard science fiction, that are very reminiscent of 'Golden Age tales' from the '40s and '50s. I've also written stories that are very high fantasy that are the direct opposite of that style.","I write speculative fiction, and in my view, speculative fiction is really just a very intense version of the work of literature in general.","The problems faced by writers of color are analogous to the problems face by women writers.","In creating the silkpunk aesthetic, I was influenced by the ideas of W. Brian Arthur, who articulates a vision of technology as a language.","The evolution of art is not only driven by artists, but by a conversation between the artists and the audience.","As an American writer, the literary tradition that I draw on the most is the Anglo-American one, and when you are writing in this tradition, the Orientalizing Western gaze is something you have to constantly push against as well as compromise with.","I find most 'rules' about how to write a 'good story' confining, and I enjoy writing stories that don't look like stories at all on the surface.","There are so many different narrative traditions across the world, and each of those traditions has evolved dramatically over time. Once I understood that, I felt truly free; I could write and invent the way I wanted to because there never has been only one way to tell a good story.","Short fiction encourages experimentation, and it's fun to play with form and try experiments that may or may not work out.","It's incredible to me that any two individual minds, trapped in their skulls and bodies and histories and unique experiences, are able to reach across the void between them and touch at all.","Like pretty much every short story writer, I submitted to every market under the sun and hoped for the best. The rejection letters I've collected over the years can probably make a book of their own.","I don't believe in reducing a style and a voice down to a set of descriptions, so I've never done that.","There's inherent cultural imbalance whenever you're translating from Chinese to English. Educated Chinese readers are expected not only to know about all the Chinese references - history, language, culture, all this stuff - but to be well-versed in Western references as well.","Labels like 'Chinese Science Fiction' or 'Western Science Fiction' summarize a vast field of work, all of which are diverse and driven by individual authors, with individual concerns.","I think writing novels has taught me more about the value of patience and being organized. I've learned to use timelines and wikis to track decisions and make sure everything still fits together. It's both easier and harder than writing short fiction.","'The Grace of Kings' was meant to read like a set of legends about characters who were bigger than life.","'The Grace of Kings' draws on Western traditions as much as it does on Chinese traditions, though the bones of the story are drawn from the Chu-Han Contention period before the Han Dynasty.","My translation work has been pretty separate from my fiction, as it was basically an accidental side project that turned into a separate and parallel career.","Almost all of my stories can be understood to be elaborations on our drive to remake the world and our adjustments to the result.","The way a story makes an argument is quite different from the way a persuasive essay does it. Emotional truth and the logic of metaphors dominate.","I get to use fiction as a way to work out my thinking and to delight readers in the process. I can't think of any deal that's better for me, and I'm always so grateful that readers have indulged me as I argue with myself in my stories."],"Ken Livingstone":["I was a weedy kid, not like one of those working-class men who can accommodate not being academically clever by physical strength and prowess.","My political beliefs are my moral, quasi-religious framework.","I'm never going to take the view that I should say whatever I need to say in order to achieve something. Because that implies a level of dishonesty.","I do explicitly see Jewish people as a people - not either a religion or an ethnicity but a people.","I mean I get loads of money, all from different sources. You give it to your accountant. They manage it. But you pay corporation tax. If you're then taking it out and spending it on yourself, you have to pay more.","If I was courting the Muslim vote, I wouldn't have put establishing the partnership ceremony at the forefront of my first term, would I? I go all around London advocating lesbian and gay rights.","All the politics of the post-war period was about the clash between the Soviet Union and America, and virtually all issues ended up being subordinated to that. Now, the question is, what is the most a socialist can achieve in a global economy?","I actually think the civil service, who are the malignancy at the heart of public life, have consciously prevented, talked ministers out of, made it difficult regulatory-wise, to allow more pressure on alternative energy sources to grow.","I would like to sound like James Mason. I reckon if I'd had a better voice I could have been prime minister. It is the most irritating voice in public life.","The world is run by monsters and you have to deal with them. Some of them run countries, some of them run banks, some of them run news corporations.","When I'm sifting the compost seed or pruning, I argue over issues in my head; I talk to myself.","Politics is not a healthy lifestyle.","Anybody who enjoys being in the House of Commons probably needs psychiatric help.","I grew up in Lambeth, I went to normal schools and I've grown up in a city where people say what they think.","World wide capitalism kills more people everyday then Hitler did. And he was crazy.","I Kenneth Robert Livingstone, having been elected to the office of mayor of London, declare that I take that office upon myself, and will duly and faithfully fulfil the duties of it to the best of my judgement and ability.","I undertake that, in the exercise of my functions of that office I will have regard to any guidance with respect to ethical standards issued by the secretary of state under Section 66 of the Greater London Authority Act 1999.","My administration will tackle these issues in consultation with the black communities of London.","If voting changed anything, they'd abolish it.","There needs to be radical development in equality law to create the environment to allow women to stay in work.","What do we do about climate change bearing down upon us?","The market is a brilliant system for the exchange of goods and services, but it doesn't protect the environment unless it's regulated, it doesn't train your workforce unless it's regulated, and it doesn't give you the long-term investment you want.","I loathe and detest all this trivialisation of politics.","I liked it when we had ugly politicians who droned on about issues.","When I was leader of the GLC, by the time I had been in control for three years, the difference in pay between the cleaner and the director general was a four-to-one ratio. I find that attractive.","I became a councillor back in 1971, so if by this stage in politics I'm making lots of big mistakes, then I shouldn't be here.","I can only admire people who I have never met and are dead - because you know so much about anyone who is alive.","The people I really most admire are Robert Kennedy and Franklin Roosevelt. If you know someone, it is very hard to revere them.","I don't work hard enough. If I had worked harder I might have been prime minister.","I'm in exactly the same position as everybody else who has a small business.","I've got people handling the media. I employ at the moment two people. No-one is paying income tax on the money they use to employ people.","I employed my wife for three years to sit in the attic and type up my autobiography, 700 pages, organise everywhere I go. I'm paying the normal rate of tax on the money I take out for myself.","Yes, there are lots of individual exceptions. But no one has ever done a study about voting intention without ascertaining that the biggest determining factor is your income and your wealth.","I refuse not to have a sense of humour.","I've always told the truth. I've often been wrong - but I've never knowingly lied. Not in public life. Because I don't see the need to.","I think it's much more important to keep people in work than have pay rises.","Every budget I have ever prepared has been balanced.","I have only ever borrowed money for investment. I have been sound money all my life.","I think I have gone through my entire public career never telling a lie. I have made mistakes but I never knowingly lied.","I can easily lose myself emotionally in absolute Hollywood garbage.","Psephology isn't a hate crime.","I go all around London advocating lesbian and gay rights.","I came into politics because I wished to change things. You can't do that by lying to people; you have to educate, and persuade, and carry them with you - and it's often a long haul.","Polling in a general election is pretty accurate, because turnout is usually high.","The whole culture of my background was deeply Conservative.","Well, I mean, I'm very much a pragmatic person.","Well, I get on with people who believe in something.","I've never declined to do an interview.","There isn't much about my life that's been particularly conventional.","Most politicians aren't allowed to express themselves any more.","I can't understand why anyone would want to live the life of a politician if you can't say pretty much what you think. You are not in it for the money: there's unremitting pressure on your life, you give up so much of your privacy. It can only be because of the things you want to do and the things you want to say.","If women had never been given the right to vote, then Labour would have won every election after the war.","The truth is, no one pays more tax than they have to.","Most people are not shocked that I am occasionally rude to journalists. They are probably amazed I don't punch one in the face.","This life is messy.","Most people wouldn't want to marry a politician.","Thatcher was prepared to destroy the world rather than give in on something she believed in.","Most kids don't get to go their parents' wedding.","The press keep asking me, 'What was your biggest mistake?' But if I had made a big mistake, they'd all be writing about it, wouldn't they?","My only regret is the media's obsession with the past.","I am not against Israel, I am against Zionists.","Jewish voters are not one homogenous block.","I could not cherish London and not value Jewish London. The contribution of Jews to London is immense - politically, economically, culturally, intellectually, philanthropically, artistically.","I am a socialist, a believer in rational thought and the rule of law.","Working with the Jewish community is essential to me and what I stand for.","The best way to demonstrate the values of a western democracy is you put Osama bin Laden on trial; you challenge what he says.","The civil service are risk averse.","Everyone changes all the time.","I spent the 1960s and 1970s seeking myself - the working-class tradition of self-education.","I swim three times a week.","I've always been a workaholic. I reckon, on average, I've had less than one day a year off in my working career.","I do the gardening.","I grew up in a house with very few books.","I'm an emotional person; I do occasionally shed a tear.","Press TV is one of the few TV channels anywhere in the West that fairly presents the Palestinian case.","I never came into life with any favours or privileges.","If you are running a city you must focus on day-to-day problems.","I have opened newspapers and read incredible lies.","I think democracy's undermined when those who own newspapers fill them with trivia rather than real issues.","I would like all newspapers to become workers' co-operatives.","Give me the whole world to run and then I'll be happy. If tomorrow I was told I had to sort out the whole world's problems I'd sleep like a baby.","I have met the people who run the world, and I am not in awe of them.","Global warming could be solved by shifting three to four per cent of global GDP to pay for it.","I have no interest in managing my financial affairs.","You lose power in Britain and you are just Joe Public again.","My main income is from speaking.","I'm more interested in politicians who deal with human rights in their own country rather than lecture the rest of the world.","Short of being prime minister there isn't a better job in British politics than running London."],"Ken Lucas":["I thought that the administration needed bipartisan support, and I was for our commander-in-chief. Because I felt at that time it was the right thing do. If I knew then what I know now, I would have never voted for the war.","The Bush administration also was not straightforward about the intelligence it had, releasing tenuous information that fit its goal of attacking Iraq. I feel deceived.","We've got to protect our young men and women and we've got to win that, whatever the cost."],"Ken MacLeod":["The idea of determinism combined with complete human responsibility struck me as very hard to reconcile with an idea of justice, let alone mercy.","The world has become one big grassy knoll, crawling with lone gunmen who think they're the Warren Commission.","I don't really believe in the Devil, but if the Devil is the Father of Lies, then he certainly invented the Internet.","What if capitalism is unsustainable, and socialism is impossible?","Science fiction made me aware of how big and strange the universe was, leaving aside the whole question of aliens.","I'm a long-term optimist, and I don't think the problems with our society are from being overly optimistic.","The real world is far too complex and unpredictable to make something like the idea of humanity controlling its own evolution or engineering itself - well, I wouldn't say impossible but it should be approached with a degree of caution."],"Ken Marino":["I'm not going to deny that I enjoy a good four or five hour karaoke session. But who doesn't?","Hey, don't knock Judy Blume. Without her, my younger self would never have been able to decode the random acts of madness perpetrated by the fascinating creature known as the teenage girl.","It's absolutely surprising to me how well 'The State' has held up as far as people liking it and having fond memories of it, considering it's a sketch show.","It wasn't that much of a stretch to play a gay demon. I am, you know, both gay and a demon. Don't tell my wife.","It's absolutely surprising to me how well 'The State' has held up as far as people liking it and having fond memories of it, considering it's a sketch show. I think one of the things that helped its mystique is, it never came out on DVD or video or whatever.","'Party Down' was one of the most magical, special experiences of my professional career. Also special in my personal life, too. I made really good friends, and I had just a great time, and it was a great part.","To go from working with a group of people in a sketch-comedy show on a small network, where it was all about just creating funny stuff, to being on a network show, and the pressures of that, and getting to know the new people who were involved in it. There was a learning curve for me. But it was an education.","The stuff I write with Joe Lo Truglio tends to lean towards horror-comedy and horror.","One of the things I would love to do is 'Axe Cop,' which is a comic book. I would like to be involved in 'Axe Cop' someday. I would also love to be in a Western.","I hope to direct a feature very soon. That is a big goal for me. I'm looking forward to hopefully getting that opportunity.","I like Comic-Con. It's always nice to talk to people who are fans of 'Children's Hospital.'","I don't want to judge America. I love America. God bless America. There are so many wonderful things about America. The fork! But we are a little behind on the bidet situation. I'm willing to say that. Hopefully we'll get our act together.","Every bathroom in my house will ultimately have a Toto bidet in it.","I'm a huge 'Eastbound & Down' fan. I'm an enormous Danny McBride fan.","I watch a lot of ESPN. I just kind of keep it on for long periods of time and watch guys yell at each other about sports things.","I love horror comedies, and I love horror movies. In particular, I love horror movies from the '80s that have practical monsters in them. They're not just slasher movies with people going to kill people in people's houses. Although I do like 'The Last House on the Left,' and things like that, I do like these ridiculous monster movies.","I love that there are so many 'Veronica Mars' fans. I was not a regular on the show. I was lucky enough to just come on. I loved the character. But, I never really realized the rabid fans that it had. I just didn't know.","I guess there are people who are like, 'Here's one thing, and I'm gonna do it,' but I can't. I don't have the capacity to have that singular focus. I need to try to get a lot of things going 'cause you never know what's gonna hit.","The key to acting is less acting and just reacting.","I just - I like the saccharin and the gooeyness of 'Bachelor,' and how just gross and like falsely romantic it is. Whereas, like, the 'Real Housewives' is just raw, and it's just - it's the fights that get me. It's just very uncomfortable for me.","I like shows where, like, there's a team that they're against the world."],"Ken Mehlman":["Conservatives don't need to change core convictions to embrace the growing support for equal rights for gay Americans.","We not only heard it before 20 years ago, before George Bush in 2001 passed his tax relief, before in 2003 the tax relief were past, we were told they were dead. Before we provided prescription drugs for Medicare, we were told it wasn't going to happen.","John Danforth, I thought, was a great senator and did a great job with the United Nations. I think he's a good man.","We are worried about the size of the deficit, which is why the president is pleased that the House and Senate have followed his lead in cutting the deficit in half over the next five years.","We've suffered a war, and one thing we know: Whenever our nation's faced war, whether it was in the 1980s when we were winning the Cold War or in the 1940s during World War II, the responsible thing to do has been to borrow money to win the war.","The president strongly believes that marriage in this country ought to be between a man and a woman. He also believes it is something that ought to be decided by the people. He doesn't believe that judges ought to impose their will on the people.","Why shouldn't future generations and young Americans have the choice to earn a higher rate of return? Why shouldn't they be able to own their own Social Security so that Congress can't spend it on other things?","Democratic leaders always seem to blame America first.","For a generation, terrorists learned they could make war on free nations without fear of war in return. On September 12, the terrorists got war in return.","I am committed to ensure that our 2008 Republican presidential candidates forthrightly address issues of importance to the African-American community.","I don't think the American people, if you look historically, elect angry candidates.","The Democrats' plan for 2006? Take the House and Senate and impeach the president. With our nation at war, is this the kind of Congress you want?","While countless Americans are pulling together to lend a helping hand, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid are pointing fingers in a shameless effort to tear us apart.","If you stop and think about our history, one of the reasons we had an American century and there is an American dream was because at key points in our history we made very bold decisions about making sure that there was very broad, universal access to quality education.","Reaching out to Hispanics is critical to our future. The fastest-growing, and most conservative, segment of the population are natural Republicans.","I will always remember and we must all remember that Democrats are our political rivals, not our enemies, and they deserve our respect.","Some Republicans gave up on winning the African-American vote, looking the other way or trying to benefit politically from racial polarization. I am here today as the Republican chairman to tell you we were wrong.","If you look at attitudes today and where they are headed, it's clear to me that supporting equal rights, including the rights to civil marriage, is a net positive for winning elections, as well as the right thing to do."],"Ken Norton":["Ali had a break that was an inch and a half long, and you keep getting hit as hard and as much as I hit Ali, the pain would take over and you would pass out.","I lost my edge for boxing, I didn't put as much into it as I did before. I didn't run as far. I didn't train as hard. I didn't eat correctly. I started drinking a little bit every now and then.","Hitting Ali in the body or on the arms was like hitting a piece of cement.","When I talk to youngsters today, especially those involved in athletics, I tell them to get their education first."],"Ken Olsen":["Software comes from heaven when you have good hardware.","There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.","When I was a teenager in the late 30's and early 40's, electronics wasn't a word. You were interested in radio if you were interested in electronics.","Teamwork was more accepted 40 years ago.","The nicest thing about standards is that there are so many of them to choose from.","On almost anything someone does in the computer business, you can go back in the literature and prove someone had done it earlier."],"Ken Robinson":["Creativity is putting your imagination to work, and it's produced the most extraordinary results in human culture.","The role of a creative leader is not to have all the ideas; it's to create a culture where everyone can have ideas and feel that they're valued.","Creativity is the process of having original ideas that have value. It is a process; it's not random.","Many highly talented, brilliant, creative people think they're not - because the thing they were good at at school wasn't valued, or was actually stigmatized.","The arts, sciences, humanities, physical education, languages and maths all have equal and central contributions to make to a student's education.","The answer is not to standardize education, but to personalize and customize it to the needs of each child and community. There is no alternative. There never was.","Creativity is as important as literacy and numeracy, and I actually think people understand that creativity is important - they just don't understand what it is.","All children start their school careers with sparkling imaginations, fertile minds, and a willingness to take risks with what they think.","Passion is the driver of achievement in all fields. Some people love doing things they don't feel they're good at. That may be because they underestimate their talents or haven't yet put the work in to develop them.","You create your life, and you can recreate it, too. In times of economic downturn and uncertainty, it's more important than ever to look deep inside yourself to fathom the sort of life you really want to lead and the talents and passions that can make that possible.","Learning happens in the minds and souls, not in the databases of multiple-choice tests.","School systems should base their curriculum not on the idea of separate subjects, but on the much more fertile idea of disciplines... which makes possible a fluid and dynamic curriculum that is interdisciplinary.","You can be creative in anything - in math, science, engineering, philosophy - as much as you can in music or in painting or in dance.","If you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original.","I believe this passionately: that we don't grow into creativity, we grow out of it. Or rather, we get educated out if it.","What you're doing now, or have done in the past, need not determine what you can do next and in the future.","Human resources are like natural resources; they're often buried deep. You have to go looking for them; they're not just lying around on the surface.","You can't just give someone a creativity injection. You have to create an environment for curiosity and a way to encourage people and get the best out of them.","Now the problem with standardized tests is that it's based on the mistake that we can simply scale up the education of children like you would scale up making carburetors. And we can't, because human beings are very different from motorcars, and they have feelings about what they do and motivations in doing it, or not.","You can't be a creative thinker if you're not stimulating your mind, just as you can't be an Olympic athlete if you don't train regularly.","We live in worlds that we have forged and composed. It's much more true than any of the species that you see. I mean, it seems to me that one of the most distinctive features of human intelligence is the capacity to imagine, to project out of our own immediate circumstances and to bring to mind things that aren't present here and now.","There's a wealth of talent that lies in all of us. All of us, including those who work in schools, must nurture creativity systematically and not kill it unwittingly.","Whether or not you discover your talents and passions is partly a matter of opportunity. If you've never been sailing, or picked up an instrument, or tried to teach or to write fiction, how would you know if you had a talent for these things?","If you're running an engineering or finance company, all companies depend on ideas and ingenuity. I think the principles of creative leadership apply everywhere, whether it's an advertising company or whether you're running a hospital.","Very often, organizations are inflexible because there is too little communication between functions; they are too segregated."],"Ken Russell":["Reality is a dirty word for me, I know it isn't for most people, but I am not interested. There's too much of it about.","Films are hard to make and I think the word indulge really leads one to believe that it's an easy sort of business and it's really extremely difficult."],"Ken Salazar":["I think the future for solar energy is bright.","It's a new day at the Department of Interior, and we need to examine what makes the most sense for the American people. These are American resources and American treasures, and we need to make sure we're providing the right kind of protection, oversight and stewardship of these resources for the American people.","Nothing in life and nothing that we do is risk-free.","Hydraulic fracking is very much a necessary part of the future of natural gas.","While it is important to maintain a balanced approach to solving our nation's energy problems, we must commit ourselves to recognize some areas as 'off limits,' and the Artic National Wildlife Reserve is a national symbol of that commitment.","I want all the interested parties to come together and develop a solution that provides additional water and helps the lower Arkansas River communities thrive again.","People who are running for office mislead the American people by saying that there's a three-point plan or a bumper sticker kind of way of bringing down gasoline prices. The fact of the matter is that nobody can do that. The price of oil is set on the global economy. People who have looked at this closely and hard know that's the case.","My family has spent 400 years farming on the banks of the Rio Grande. We know the value of hard work, love of the community, love for water and land.","Growing up in a very rural and remote area in Colorado's San Luis Valley - one of the poorest counties in the United States - essentially created the framework of values from which I operate. I stand up for the little guy. I fight discrimination at all levels. I fight for an inclusive America.","Too often in Washington special interests urge us to fight one another just because we belong to different parties. It is time for this to stop and for Washington to focus on what needs to be done.","Americans pay up to 1,000 percent more to fill their prescriptions than consumers in other countries - that is an alarming statistic.","Meth is a major problem not only in our urban areas, but in most of the rural areas of Colorado. No region has been immune from this scourge and it is getting larger.","Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is one of my personal heroes.","Each and every Notary Public plays a crucial role in combating identity theft. They serve as our front line of defense and the public is safer because of the job they do.","In the West, you take people at their word.","Liability does apply with respect to the amount of the oil spill.","Barack Obama was not born into wealth or privilege, yet today his is president of these United States of America. Barack Obama has lived the American Dream. He has walked in our shoes.","I'm proud that Colorado delivered a victory to Barack Obama in 2008 and we will do so again in 2012.","The way Americans most understand the history of Latinos in this country, a lot of it is being told now through the lens of what's happening with the immigration debate. While that's an important debate that has security and moral implications, in my view, there's also a huge history of Latinos in the United States that's never been told.","I don't think anyone can speculate what will happen with respect to oil prices and gas prices because they are set on the global economy.","Shale gas has provided the United States the opportunity to have 100 years of supply that is domestically produced. If we are going to develop natural gas from shale, it has to be done in a safe and responsible manner.","I think Gov. Romney and Congressman Ryan are living in a fairly tale land on their energy policy.","President Obama and our all-of-the-above energy strategy is the real deal. We are proud of the fact that we are importing less oil than at any time in modern history, and it has been because of the president's vision and courage.","We are talking about institutionalizing a program on solar development that will outlast the Obama administration.","I don't believe that the American dream should be reserved for those who are born into the elite or somehow have been given an advantage over others. My growing-up experience is probably the most important thing that guides my priorities and my work today.","For some in Washington, it's become sport to pick on the federal workforce. I think they do so unjustly. The very foundation of a stable America is having a government that functions well. Many countries have dysfunctional governments, because they don't have a good government workforce.","On the Native American front, we have turned a new page in the 400-year history of the interface between the American settlers of this country and the nation's first Americans. That's included a new relationship where the sovereignty of tribes is in fact recognized.","Frankly that's what makes such a big difference between President Obama on one hand and Mitt Romney on the other. Gov. Romney has not walked in those shoes of the ordinary Americans and frankly I don't think he has the capacity to quite understand the struggle that the 98 percent of Americans go through every single day.","In my time in the U.S. Senate, I tried to craft an energy policy... I will be part of President Obama's efforts to achieve energy independence and enhance the landscape. I am also part of his reform agenda.","I work hard and I have a standard of excellence - and I expect everyone at the Interior Department to meet that same standard. I delegate a lot. I might appear to be doing a lot of different things, but there's a strong team helping me. I believe we're going to have the strongest team of any agency in the Obama administration."],"Ken Spillman":["The best way to enhance a child's imagination is to make them read.","Making reading an enjoyable activity for children is a challenge. So I ensure that I write in a way that is fun for children to read.","My aunt could never understand how writing could be a full-time job. She'd keep asking when I'd get a real job!","Interacting with Indian children was so fulfilling. They are so affectionate. Every school I've visited, I've been overwhelmed by the enthusiasm and love they've showered me with!"],"Ken Starr":["Don't blame the messenger because the message is unpleasant.","Whether the story reflects the facts is obviously a different matter.","The values of confidentiality of matters occurring before the grand jury is very important.","Higher educating has so many challenges, and private higher education has a special challenge of ever rising tuition costs.","We were criticized throughout that investigation for being too thorough, for taking too long. But time has proved the correctness of that approach.","I don't believe anyone has leaked grand jury information.","Lawyers claim that their clients have been grossly mistreated, which is what criminal defense lawyers are paid to do.","I think the President inspires tremendous affection and loyalty by a wide range of people.","When we had highly sensitive information, the DNA on the dress, that was held within our office and the FBI. There was no dissemination of that information.","There is no excuse for perjury - never, never, never. There is truth, and the truth demands respect.","I said in sharp language that that practice was wrong.","After an extensive investigation, the office produced a report that addressed the many questions that confronted the difficult issues, it laid out new evidence, and it reached a definitive conclusion.","We were in Little Rock. We were assessing a very important issue. In the midst of our discussions, we were receiving urgent inquiries from The Washington Post asking about interviews.","We must combat misinformation that is being spread.","The whole idea of equal justice under law means that you've got to play by the rules. It has nothing to do with the underlying subject matter. You just tell the truth.","Lying under oath, and encouraging lies under oath, does go to the very heart and soul of what courts do. If we say we don't care, let's forget about courts, and we'll just have other ways of figuring out how to handle disputes.","In contrast to what most prosecutors do, we try to treat all individuals with complete fairness. We do not go out and hold press conferences and the like.","I was privileged to serve as a judge.","I was assigned to do a job by the attorney general, and that was to find out whether crimes were committed.","I thought we were to discuss a referral which we believe contains substantial and credible information of potential impeachable offenses by the President of the United States.","I do not speak frequently or otherwise to the press.","I am not here to accuse the media of anything.","You're making me feel like a skunk at the garden party.","Government lawyers have a duty to disclose evidence of wrongdoing in the government.","As you may know, I'm a native Texan. In fact I'm a fifth generation Texan.","I had loans in law school.","In law, one's sense of calling or vocation will lead one to be interested in certain dimensions of Constitutional law.","Rights are in the power of the people."],"Ken Stott":["For me, acting is a series of impressions rather than trying to find one line through to the end, which risks becoming more of a presentation.","The Scottish are not shy when it comes to expressing themselves.","I always leave room for serendipity and chance.","There are many actors who'll make their living in other areas, and they'll say they don't like theatre. What they're saying is that they're afraid of theatre because they know it will separate those who can from those who can't.","No acting, no production, could take the place of that moment when you come out in the dark on to the stage and the drummer plays four beats on the hi-hat and then lights and music. It just takes your breath away. No words can do what music can.","An actor has power, and their power is very simple: it's the power to say no.","No one will die if they don't know how old I am.","My first major role was in a play called 'Through the Leaves.'","I used to be under the impression that if a role wasn't difficult, then there was nothing happening. Then a director said to me: 'Ken, you've got to realise, acting can be fun, too.'","Inspector Rebus is a great character, so when the opportunity came up to revive the role for 'BBC Children in Need,' and really have a bit of fun with it, I was happy to take part.","In every area, we seem to have thrown everything away and embraced reality television. It's nauseating, programme after programme.","The establishment is a dirty, dangerous beast, and the BBC is a mouthpiece for that.","Producers and directors think they have the power, but what they think of as the weakest link, the actor, is all-powerful.","Nobody's going to say hello to me in the street, really, because there'll be someone a bit more famous coming along the street in a minute. That typifies London, really.","I am wholeheartedly in favour of an independent Scotland.","I am very aware of how warmly Scotland is regarded around the world, and a vote for self-determination would raise our international profile even further, with lots of benefits for Scottish arts and culture.","I read 'the Hobbit' at the age when you're supposed to read it. I didn't read 'The Lord Of The Rings.' My father, who was an English teacher, advised me that once I had read 'the Hobbit,' that would be enough. I could then move on to Dostoyevsky.","'Death Of A Salesman' is a great acting job.","Whenever I see pointless use of special effects, I reach for something else.","I like to play these unconventional characters, yes. They're close to the way I feel as a human being.","I do feel my work has momentum.","I wanted success, but I wanted it on my own terms.","Villains are often attractive.","I've got a feeling that with the best coppers - and in fact the best people in any field of work - what sets them apart is a maverick quality. People who are not afraid to bend the rules in order to achieve the universally desired end."],"Ken Thompson":["When in doubt, use brute force.","One of my most productive days was throwing away 1,000 lines of code.","No amount of source-level verification or scrutiny will protect you from using untrusted code.","In college, before video games, we would amuse ourselves by posing programming exercises.","There's a lot of power in executing data - generating data and executing data.","It's always good to take an orthogonal view of something. It develops ideas.","I still have a full-time day job, which is why it took me five years to write An Ear to the Ground, and why I won't have another book finished by next week.","I think the major good idea in Unix was its clean and simple interface: open, close, read, and write.","If you want to go somewhere, goto is the best way to get there.","So maybe I can go back to being a Gardeners' World addict again.","You can't trust code that you did not totally create yourself.","A well installed microcode bug will be almost impossible to detect.","Grant, if we edited Fortran, I assume that you'd put a column thing in there.","I also have an idea for a book on biodiversity, and why and how we should be conserving it.","I am a programmer.","I am a very bottom-up thinker.","I have to keep up with the scientific literature as part of my job, but increasingly I found myself reading things that weren't really relevant to my academic work, but were relevant to gardening.","I wanted to avoid, special IO for terminals.","I wanted to have virtual memory, at least as it's coupled with file systems.","I wanted to separate data from programs, because data and instructions are very different.","In fact, we started off with two or three different shells and the shell had life of its own.","It is only the inadequacy of the criminal code that saves the hackers from very serious prosecution.","On the one hand, the press, television, and movies make heroes of vandals by calling them whiz kids.","One is that the perfect garden can be created overnight, which it can't.","That brings me to Dennis Ritchie. Our collaboration has been a thing of beauty.","The average gardener probably knows little about what is going on in his or her garden.","The X server has to be the biggest program I've ever seen that doesn't do anything for you.","There are no projects per se in the Computing Sciences Research Center.","Unauthorized access to computer systems is already a serious crime in a few states and is currently being addressed in many more state legislatures as well as Congress.","We have persistant objects, they're called files.","We tried to avoid, you know, records. We were told over and over that was probably the most serious mistake and the reason was the system would never catch on, because we didn't have records."],"Ken Venturi":["I don't believe you have to be better than everybody else. I believe you have to be better than you ever thought you could be.","The greatest gift in life is to be remembered.","Victory is everything. You can spend the money but you can never spend the memories.","There are two great rules of life: never tell everything at once.","When my father spoke, it was to say something meaningful.","I had a terrible stammering problem when I was young, and as a result I spent a lot of time alone.","The hardest thing in golf is trying to two-putt when you have to, because your brain isn't wired that way. You're accustomed to trying to make putts, and when you change that mind-set, your brain short-circuits, especially under pressure.","Retirement isn't so bad. Give me a tall drink, a plush sofa and a rerun of 'Matlock,' and you can have the rest. Matlock is my hero. He never loses.","I began seeing my wife, Kathleen, while I was undergoing treatment for prostate cancer.","People thought I was cocky because I didn't talk much. When I first turned pro, reporters asked me who was going to win. I'd say, 'I am' because it was the easier than giving some long, drawn-out answer.","I couldn't say my own name when I was 12.","My father taught me that the easiest thing to do was to quit. He'd say, 'It doesn't take any talent to do that.'","My father was a man of few words."],"Ken Wallace":["Making the Australian team is the hardest part, and going to the Olympics is the easy part. You're there representing your country - you're representing every single person in it, strangers you don't know - and there's a lot of positive energy, but you have to know to channel it the right way.","Until 2005, I still thought of my surf lifesaving career as fulltime and kayaking as a pastime. I watched the 2004 Athens Olympics and saw people racing that I knew I could beat, and that was probably the turning point: I decided I should either do it properly or stop wasting time kayaking and concentrate fully on Ironman.","Every team boat will have its disagreements and arguments, but if it doesn't kill us or the boat, it will make us stronger.","My biggest motivation is knowing what it feels like to win medals and thinking that I want that feeling again. It was incredible to succeed in Beijing and come home to your whole country behind you but, importantly, all your family and friends.","I just love racing: I'll even race you to the door.","Before the last Olympics, we had meat raffles at the local surf club to get petrol money to go to training, to help out with the bills. But I know there are a lot of athletes worse off and that all athletes, at some stage of their careers, have made sacrifices."],"Ken Watanabe":["I'm not a big star in Japan. I'm an actor. I have a very normal life. Four days a week, I cook at home. A star doesn't do that.","Each director is different. Clint Eastwood and Chris Nolan are completely different, and I need to adjust to the story and character and the director and just my duty as an actor.","With 'Letters from Iwo Jima,' then 'Memories of Tomorrow,' I reached a sort of turning point in my acting. I had poured so much of myself into those movies that I really had no idea where to go from there.","If the script is good, the cast and director good, I'll go anywhere.","About half the scripts sent to me feature characters I just can't identify with, particularly one-dimensional businessmen or, if it's a comedy, some absurd 10-year-old Japanese stereotype, some role related to IT or business... There's no point in getting mad about it; it's just the way things are.","I have no sense of myself as a sex symbol at all. But the meaning of sex symbol might be a little different in Japan to elsewhere. The Japanese version seems to come with a stronger emphasis on a sort of grownup or mature male charm. And if that's the case, then I guess I'm happy to hear it.","As a Japanese actor, I really want to work with a lot of actors and actresses in the world and many directors who have many different kinds of talents. I feel like nationally doesn't matter at all."],"Ken Wilber":["I rise to taste the dawn, and find that love alone will shine today.","What's my philosophy? In a word, integral.","The Enlightenment was an attempt to liberate myth and base truth claims on evidence, not just dogma. But when science threw out the church, they threw out the baby with the bath water.","Most of us, I suspect, prefer our teachers to be of the Nice Guy variety.","What is it in you that brings you to a spiritual teacher in the first place? It's not the spirit in you, since that is already enlightened, and has no need to seek. No, it is the ego in you that brings you to a teacher.","I think I was a born scientist.","I went to Duke University in the medical track. And then I decided I wanted to do something more creative, so I switched to biochemistry at Nebraska.","I don't talk about consciousness. I talk about interiority."],"Kenan Thompson":["Comedy is here to bring joy to the world, whether you want to hear the curse words or not.","I'm a happy person, and I want everybody else to be happy. Nothing wrong with that.","I'm silly. I can't help it.","I wish we could just pick up and do 'Kenan & Kel: The Grown-Up Years,' getting everyone back working together. I feel like it would be an awesome moment for everybody.","I started working right away as a kid, so I didn't have a chance to go to improv school or anything like that; I was already a working actor.","I owe a lot to Nickelodeon.","I want to get into producing and writing more for myself - setting up my own films and seeing what kind of personal touch I can put on movies, as opposed to just being in them.","There's a lot of pressure on kids, period, just to be successful in life.","I was a good student in school.","I was always pretty funny with my friends.","My immediate family is real close-knit.","I always just want to do non-typical voices for some reason.","Never thought I'd be a bobble-head, but little did I know.","Kids have awkward moments.","I'm a fan of Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, and all these people. If I could end up like Jonah Hill, winding up in a Brad Pitt movie, that would be awesome.","I've always just tried to continue to be a working actor and let the work speak for itself as opposed to promoting myself as someone who needs to be in everybody's living room.","It's just a challenge doing live television every week; you know, it's a challenge to come up with new material every week and stuff like that and try to keep it current, you know what I mean? Like, it's just, you know, it's a kind of a stressful environment.","Leaving Nickelodeon was definitely an adjustment. Because then, it was back to the real world of, 'Now I'm an adult looking for a job,' as opposed to a kid that's getting introduced to all these people like, 'Look how cute this little kid is. Don't you want to put him on your show?'","I'm very happy here at 'SNL.' I've never been in a hurry to leave because it's such a special place. It's never the same when you leave and come back.","'SNL' has kind of been like my school.","As far as my sketches, I've always loved 'What's Up With That.' It's just a whole lot of fun, and I love 'Black Jeopardy,' too. Any kind of host capacity, I'm usually pretty good at.","I never did standup before. It just looked like it was really hard, looked like there was like up days and down days - and I'm too emotionally unstable for that. I need to always be funny and always be loved.","I used to go trick-or-treating all the time. When I was young we had the plastic mask with the rubber band that would cut your face, and you couldn't breathe and it was really sweaty! I had the Incredible Hulk and Spider-Man. I used to love the Incredible Hulk, and then one year I had the great idea to be Mr. T, and that was an awesome costume too.","It's just cool to witness talent.","I don't know what to do with babies.","I guess I was just a young, fun-loving kid! Me and my older brother was always quoting 'Coming to America,' 'Spies Like Us,' '48 Hours,' and all those movies, just having fun amongst ourselves.","When I started acting, doing theater stuff at a young age, I was always the comic relief-type roles, so I knew I had a funny bone and could make groups of people laugh, but I didn't really take it seriously until I started getting paid on a weekly basis; then I was like, 'Oh, well, this could be a lifestyle.'","There's a lot of theaters in New York. You can always go out and be around a lot of like-minded comedians.","I want to open an eye or two about what being an actor is really like because it's not all red carpets and photo shoots. It's like trying to get that job and going from job to job.","I'm very friendly. I get along with people.","I just try to deliver the laughs every time I get the opportunity.","I never really try to over-promote myself; I never have.","I don't necessarily have a traditional stand-up set.","It's nice to predict your schedule, especially with a child. It's nice to have work and be in a stable place, which isn't always easy for actors.","I support the homies, like Mike Jay and Hannibal Buress. And I listen to Comedy Central Radio in the car."],"Kendall Jenner":["What people don't understand is that calling someone too skinny is the same as calling someone too fat; it's not a nice feeling.","Modelling isn't something I'm doing to prove people wrong. It's something I'm doing because it's what I want to do.","You can get a million comments about how beautiful you look and how awesome you are, but the one comment that says they hate you and you're ugly is the one that sticks.","If I see something really nasty on Twitter, I will usually delete it or block the person because I don't want to see that every day... Get to know me, and then you can talk about me!","Sexy is confident.","I think social media has taken over for our generation. It's a big part of our lives, and it's kind of sad.","When it rains, I have good energy; I'm in a good mood.","My parents taught me that work ethic is one of the most important keys in life, and I believe it.","I like to go outside at night by myself and look at the sky and just appreciate it. I'm not that big of a weirdo, but - occasionally.","Modeling is my number one priority - one hundred percent.","I try not to be too invasive into my personal life. When I was younger, I used to tweet a lot, everything I was doing and feeling. I can't do that anymore, because it's just giving people too much room to judge.","I was always looking up to supermodels. They were, like, my superheroes.","I will go back to riding one day - when I have kids. I have such amazing childhood memories of being on horseback.","I was the biggest liar for no reason, and then as I got older, I thought, 'Why am I lying to everybody?' I would hear other people lie and be like, 'You sound so stupid.' So then I would just change my lies. The only person I lie to is my little sister, when I steal her clothes.","I'm lucky that I've never been bullied personally. There are always going to be kids who are mean and say stuff, but the people that matter to you - the people you love, like your parents, your siblings, and your friends - those are the people you should listen to.","My ideal prom date would have to be cute, funny, sweet, nice.","I guess my style's a little edgy but comfortable. I like being comfortable, for sure, and kind of casual.","You can't take anything personally in this business. Follow your dreams, but there is a lot of criticism. You have to brush it off. Everybody is looking for something different.","I'm trying my best with what I want to do, which is modelling. I think I'm on my own career path, and I don't really care what other people have to say about me being in the spotlight of my sisters. I'm just doing my own thing.","Sometimes I just want to be left alone and be a normal kid for, like, five minutes. That's tough when the paparazzi are chasing you.","Every girl loves posing in her underwear. It's always fun to do that.","I try to keep my filters simple. I don't do anything major to my photos.","My name is Kendall. Kendall Jenner. I am not a Kardashian.","I think a natural look is prettier. I rarely wear makeup, but we always wear sunscreen on our faces.","My favorite thing about doing photo shoots is just being able to have fun, meeting new people, getting dressed up, and I just love doing it. So, I have a lot of fun.","I think mascara is a must. If I'm going to wear makeup somewhere, and I'm doing it, it's usually really simple - it's just mascara and maybe a tiny bit of eyeshadow, but that's it.","When I was a kid, I was so homesick at all times.","Ask me a question about paparazzi, and I get so heated. And I feel so bad for young kids of celebrities. My nieces and nephews get yelled at, and I'm like, 'You are yelling at a 2-year-old.'","I love a red lip - red is one of my favorite colors, and I really don't wear many other lipstick colors than red.","Runway is like an adrenaline rush.","I don't work with a trainer. I just go to cheerleading practice and run a couple times a week.","I'm a very loyal and very private person when it comes to my personal life. But I obviously do have Twitter and Instagram, and I will share some of the things I'm doing.","My dad is my dad, but he's not there physically anymore. But she lets me call her 'Dad' - that's the last little piece of Dad I've got.","I weirdly love interior design and real estate and all of that. I really do. I get chills from it.","I'm super OCD, so everything is clean.","You have no idea how many doors closed on me and how many adults were either initially reluctant to take a chance working with me or who outright laughed at me behind my back.","I want to continue modeling and do the best that I can with that.","I feel really productive. I'm very competitive with myself. I'm a scheduler. I'm always trying to keep everything together - I'm very OCD and very organized.","I'm big about washing my face before I go to bed, washing it when I wake up in the morning, getting good sleep and drinking a lot of water. Those are just easy things that you can do for your skin.","I remember being a kid and trying to do make-up and being so bad at it - but my sister Kylie was so good. It came so naturally to her. For me, it was never natural.","I enjoy letting my fans into my world.","I've always been a huge family person. Growing up with such a huge family, it was just amazing, so coming home to that is always awesome and... it makes me happy.","As a kid, I always looked up to supermodels, thinking about how amazing they are. I always wanted to be in photos.","If I could trade places with any of my sisters for a day, it would be Kim. I want to see what it's like... The only time she sleeps is on the airplane. It's just crazy. I feel bad for her, but I still want to know what it's like.","Some people might think that what I've done before made it easier for me to get jobs, but it was actually a disadvantage. I had to work even harder.","I've really learned to appreciate a moment. I take things in a lot. I'm kind of weird like that.","If we're fighting, we call Khloe. She's our peacemaker. Kourtney keeps us down-to-earth.","It's just scary to think how fast everything is rolling, and you can't stop it.","I volunteered at Meals on Wheels, which is a place where you go and deliver healthy meals to people who are more homebound. I did that, and I had so much fun doing it, and I'm definitely planning on doing it again.","My style icon actually is my three sisters. I love the way they dress and the way they put things together. I definitely get most of my style from them.","I definitely want to design clothes at one point.","I'm obsessed with Tumblr. I love looking at all the pictures!","I really don't have a celebrity crush.","In first grade, I told my friends I had a third story in my house filled with jewels and lions.","It's true, I used to be so shy. I used to never talk, just sit back and do my thing. I was never bullied, though, and it was never like it was something that needed to be 'fixed', like being shy is a bad thing.","Me and Kylie are sisters, but not everything we can always do together. She's not trying to be a model. She's trying to be more like a personality. We're trying to kind of separate ourselves - not in a bad way!","My way to de-stress is either listening to music or talking to my sister, Kourtney. She's going to teach me how to meditate, and that should help a lot.","My dream jobs would be Italian 'Vogue' and anything with Chanel!","The New York fashion scene is crazy, madness, but I love the energy.","I think Cindy Crawford is awesome. I love her style.","I had just started ninth grade when I got my acne. And I had braces. I wouldn't look people in the eye. It was not a good time for me - it just killed my self-esteem. I thought when I didn't look at someone, they couldn't see my face.","When I started getting in front of the camera a lot, I think my confidence started to come out.","I try my best, but at the same time, I try not to let being out with someone affect my everyday life. Like, if I want to go out and grab a smoothie with a friend who's a male, I'm not gonna let the paparazzi stop me from doing that and living my life and just being a normal person.","When I was younger, we lived in a horse community.","The first campaign that I recall was with Kate Moss and Marky Mark. Probably the most iconic jeans ad ever.","I am so grateful to Marc Jacobs, Riccardo Tisci, Karl Lagerfeld, and Katie Grand, who took a chance on me that first season and gave me an opportunity.","Before I got the contract, I'd heard from a lot of people that a contract with a company like Estee Lauder was like a stamp of approval, a stamp of your legit-ness. So getting that was a really big step for me.","I wanted to fly when I was little.","I'm the fastest walker, and everyone makes fun of me for it.","My life was always different growing up. I mean, even before the show, my dad was who he is. He's an Olympic athlete. And we were going to premieres, like 'Finding Nemo' premieres, and we would be little kids, like, before the show, walking down the red carpet.","My sisters take, like, hours to get ready, and I'm, like, really quick. I think I get that from my dad.","I've been to some of the most amazing cities in the world.","I get really mean or emotional if I don't have food in my system.","Kylie and I are both pretty brave - much braver than the Kardashians. We have the Jenner in us.","I think I'm the most private out of my family.","I'm very competitive with myself. I'm a scheduler.","I want to be like a Christy Turlington, still doing my craft and still killing it. I want longevity and to be able to do this for a really long time.","I would literally sit at home and have my friends take pictures of me on my little Canon camera that my mom gave me for Christmas."],"Kendall Schmidt":["I'm pretty much living my dream job, but one day I would love to dedicate more time to writing and performing my own music.","I have a great relationship with everyone in my family, but I'm closer to my brothers than anyone else because they give me a lot of guidance.","I don't eat fast food - and neither should you!","I'm a huge candy fan. My favorite growing up was always Sour Belts or Sour Straws.","I'm into Incubus. Growing up, I was a huge Taking Back Sunday fan. I'm still a fan, but I don't listen as much as I used to. When I was 13 or 14, I started getting into emo-pop-rock, so that influenced me. I also love Drake... I have a pretty diverse collection.","Look your significant other in the eyes, make that connection."],"Kendra Wilkinson":["I've only fallen in love once, and once was enough for me, but that doesn't mean my eyes won't wander, and it doesn't mean I won't flirt!","There are curveballs that are thrown at you, and you just have to get over it and forgive... if you believe you're perfect, and you don't believe in forgiveness, you're not meant to be married.","In my heart, I will always love Hef and Playboy.","I learned that being husband and wife is just a label. It becomes, 'Do you really care about the person, the human underneath the label?' And I do, and I really do.","I don't want to be linked to anything negative. I don't want negative energy. I want everything positive around me.","Anything negative, I have to let go because it's too toxic for me.","While I didn't have a father around, I did have - and what I want my children to both experience - the ability to explore, experiment and enjoy life as a kid.","Before, back in the '50s, women didn't have as many rights as men, so they had to be that stay-at-home wife and take care of the kids all day. But now, with marriage, it's a partnership. It's not like this old traditional marriage that it once was.","All I wanted was for my mom to say, 'I love you, and I'm here for you.' I never got that.","I can't manipulate anybody's minds.","I've done everything I can in my life to be the best person I can be, and I can look in the mirror and say that.","I think everything is a motive for money. Every thought, every belief, everything we're taught in school.","I'm very fun; I like to have fun, and I don't like to take life too serious, so of course everybody saw me as the outgoing fun one and the crazy one.","You can't get more glamorous than you are on 'Dancing with the Stars.'","I love reality TV and everything, and it's something that I truly love to do, and I love the outcome of it; it's like my art. I consider my reality show as my art piece, and it's like a sculpture that I built; it's my baby.","The thing that what we're taught in the public school system is everything you should know, I disagree with that. The most brilliant people in the world were dropouts - not that I'm pro-dropping out.","I support Donald Trump, but I also support abortion and a women's right to choice, what to do with their body.","I like to save my money for buying houses.","I moved into the Playboy Mansion at 18 years old.","The best date would have to be at a sporting event - it will show the guy what type of girl she is.","I believe in spirits, not ghosts.","Writing is something that's great because you get to write every thought that's on your mind; you take your time.","Given the news we all read or hear about, it's actually made me a stronger parent - I'm not a 'helicopter parent,' but I am very aware of local and world events and want to teach them what's right and wrong.","I gained about 60 pounds when I was preggers with Lil Hank, and I'm desperately trying not to do the same with our daughter.","I learned to cook because I want to know about the food and the ingredients going into my family's bodies.","I get to teach my daughter what I've learned. I don't want her to feel she has to be a certain way to impress society. If she wants to spit or go play some ball, I'll be so proud, because that's who I am, and that's a real person.","Every woman is sexy in her own way. It is up to men to step up and make women feel like they are No. 1 on that list. There is no such thing as perfection.","I never, ever see myself as a celebrity or famous, so I poke fun at that.","I live my life on TV - it's like a home video.","I would get my laugh insured! Because my laugh is very important: it's a million dollar laugh, so if my vocal chords make my laugh any different, then I'm going to have to get insured.","I have nothing to hide.","I have no shame.","Being a reality star is very chaotic: it's a very dramatic job to do. I always 24/7 have to be on and ready for any type of criticism at all times.","I love being a comfortable person, but I'm very open. I'm not ashamed of myself and my beliefs.","Even my conservative friends consider me conservative.","I think a lot of things are shoved in our face, politically and historically, for money, and that's the motive.","I am a free-spirited mom.","When I was pregnant with Alijah, little Hank would have all these questions. Where do babies come from? So I was open with him.","I want to raise my kid different from me.","I would try to guide my children in a different way to have a career. Something besides being an actress, singer or model. I'm definitely going to push my kids in the other direction.","I have had a lifetime love affair with all types of dance. Pole dancing was always just for fun until we had a pole installed at 'The Girls Next Door' house, then we started taking it a bit more seriously and got into using it for exercise.","Any woman can make pole dancing a regular part of their exercise routine - and a fun part of their romantic life!","Nobody's gonna be a perfect parent, you know? We're all doing the best we can.","The path that I chose was simple - it was the exact path I should've taken, and I have no regrets at all.","I'm trying to put the past to rest, but things just keep popping up to just pull me back in.","I believe that both people in a marriage should be concentrated on health, and you should be inspiring each other. How to make your mind healthier, how to make your body healthier. Healthy mind, healthy body, healthy soul.","You shouldn't vent and open up to your husband, your boyfriend, your friend, because they're not professionals; they don't know the right thing to say to you, and putting them in that position is tricky. You have to look at it from their standpoint. It's so much pressure.","I don't want to scar people with my baby flab. I have this extra skin that's hanging. I'm in shape, but my skin, from having a baby, is not cute, hanging off of my baby.","Open relationships aren't for me.","I love our traditional marriage. I would never cheat on Hank.","Hank's the most amazing person on the planet, and if it's not him, there's no one else I want to be married to.","I was actually more of a baseball and Padres fan when I was younger.","I do not. I don't bet.","Flossin' is a term like when you're 'fly.' It's like, 'I floss. I walk around with my head up; no one can touch me.'","After giving birth, I never brushed my hair, my teeth, or took a shower. I looked in the mirror one day and was really depressed.","I am a complete wuss.","I quit 'Splash!' because I couldn't dive off a 3 m. board.","I cannot be bored, and I always want to have fun.","I can entertain. I am a party girl. I am a free spirit.","I'm a goofball.","I actually don't DVR. I don't even know if I know how to use it!","One thing I don't do is quit.","When I was a teenager, I battled some severe depression.","I never, ever see myself as a celebrity or famous.","I'm very aware of how quickly my career could end.","I have no talent. I have nothing to offer.","I have so much to offer and so much love and emotion to show.","During my grandma's funeral, I looked over once and saw my mom crying, and I felt so bad for her.","They're always saying that tragedy brings family closer, but unfortunately, sometimes it doesn't work like that.","I deserve a mom.","When my grandma passed away, the one person I prayed for was my mom. I just hope that she finds peace. I hope she believes in a loving life.","I work very hard... I love to show what I work so hard to do.","I'm not a girl who's into home comforts and luxury.","My whole life has been on TV.","There's not one minute of my life that hasn't been documented. How do I feel about that? I would feel extremely bad about not having it on camera. That's how natural it is to me.","I believe we all grow because we share our experiences and our problems. We all have our intimate times. Why not share them?","I'll be the best person and mother, everything I can be.","I can say, out of my whole life, my dad left the situation at an early age for me; he left. But my mum turned her back on me."],"Kendrick Lamar":["My moms always told me, 'How long you gonna play the victim?' I can say I'm mad and I hate everything, but nothing really changes until I change myself.","If I'm gonna tell a real story, I'm gonna start with my name.","The hardest thing for - not only an artist but for anybody to do is look themselves in the mirror and acknowledge, you know, their own flaws and fears and imperfections and put them out there in the open for people to relate to it.","I learned, when I look in the mirror and tell my story, that I should be myself and not peep whatever everybody is doing.","People have to go through trials and tribulations to get where they at. Do your thing - continue to rock it - because obviously, God wants you here.","I don't want to be something that just comes and goes.","It's a great, great experience to finally get the reception that you know you rightfully deserve.","It's easy to forget who you are.","People gonna be they own individuals and have they own worlds and I can't knock it.","I look at where I'm at today and realize that most of my success is owed to the mentors that was in my life.","My word will never be as strong as God's word. All I am is just a vessel, doing His work.","I'm only as good as my last word, my last hook, my last bridge.","I think my worst problem is actually living in the moment and understanding everything that's going on. I feel like I'm in my own bubble.","This is the thing about hip-hop music and where people get it most misconstrued: It's all hip-hop. You can't say that just what I do is hip-hop, because hip-hop is all energies. James Brown can get on the track and mumble all day. But guess what? You felt his soul on those records.","I'm constantly thinking.","I always tell people that if I move anywhere it would be Toronto.","Sometimes you have the trends that's not that cool. You may have certain artists portraying these trends and don't really have that lifestyle, and then it gives off the wrong thing. And it becomes kinda corny after awhile. It's really about keeping hip-hop original and pushing away the corniness in it.","If my edge is dull, my sword is dull, and I don't want to fight another guy whose sword is dull. If you've got two steel swords going back and forth hitting each other, what's gonna happen? Both of them are going to get sharper. Everybody that's in the industry has lost their edge.","My whole thing is to inspire, to better people, to better myself forever in this thing that we call rap, this thing that we call hip hop.","The majority of my interactions with police were not good. There were a few good ones who were actually protecting the community. But then you have ones from the Valley. They never met me in their life, but since I'm a kid in basketball shorts and a white T-shirt, they wanna slam me on the hood of the car. Sixteen years old.","As long as my music is real, it's no limit to how many ears I can grab.","Me, as a person, I grow. I'm like a chameleon. You know? That is a gift and a curse for me. But more so a gift, because it never puts me in a box.","I can't help the way you was born if you was gay.","I think my vice would be outdoing myself.","When I talk to kids, I'm really listening. When I do that, we have a little bit of a bigger connection than me being Kendrick Lamar and you being a student. It's almost like we're friends. Because a friend listens.","The best thing is to always keep honest people around, because when you have a bunch of yes men around that know that you're making a mistake but let you go on with it, that's when it ruins your mind state as an artist.","Eventually you get to this point where you understand what you want to do and get across and sound like.","I don't vote. I don't do no voting.","Since day one, since the first time I touched the pen, I wanted to be the best at what I do.","I like to let things breathe.","People are used to music that justifies street culture but something that's not touched on is why these kids act the way they act, live the way they live.","I've been called a recluse. There's definitely truth in that. I like to spend time alone.","I had to come from something, come from a place that was negative and positive but the majority of it is a negative place.","Whenever I make music, it reflects where I'm at mentally.","Temptation is just the feeling that you're the most independent person on planet Earth. That you know everything. That's something that we all go through as a kid. Now, this lifestyle that I'm in, the same thing exists! But it's 10 times worse, because everything is at my disposal. When you're in the limelight, you can get anything you want.","The worst part of success is, to me, adapting to it. It's scary.","Being acknowledged for your work is always a great accomplishment, whether it's people in my city, kids in the street, all the way up to the Grammys.","God to me is love.","When you go on your Twitter or look down your Timeline and it's all great positivity - I love that. But at the same time, it can really divert you from what your purpose is or what you're trying to do. And I've seen artists get caught up in that.","I'm sticking to the script, I'm putting that organic feeling back in the game.","At first, I was scared to show fear because you can never be sure how people will perceive you. But I dared myself to do that, to stand out. Now I'll talk about being beaten up or robbed or making a stupid decision because of a girl or whatever.","My passion is bringing storylines around and constructing a full body of work rather than just a 16-bar verse.","I got a greater purpose. God put something in my heart to get across, and that's what I'm going to focus on, using my voice as an instrument and doing what needs to be done.","I knew I was blessed with a gift of having both parents.","Groups break up because they never got across what they wanted to do personally, and they have creative differences, and egos start to clash.","The way people look at me these days - that's the same way I looked at President Obama before I met him. We tend to forget that people who've attained a certain position are human.","I'm just writing, writing, writing. I keep these tablets on me until I'm inspired to go back in and make the music. I never take a break from my pen, because I pride myself on that.","When everybody looks at our generation of kids, they always call us the misfits - you know, like we just don't give a damn.","I always thought money was something just to make me happy. But I've learned that I feel better being able to help my folks, 'cause we never had nothing. So just to see them excited about my career is more of a blessing than me actually having it for myself.","I always was that person who was hard on myself and challenged myself no matter what I was doing, whether it was passing third grade or playing basketball.","My pops and my mom started playing Marvin Gaye and the Isley Brothers and all these people, but at the same time, they always had Snoop on right behind it in the same mix.","We're all put on this earth to walk in His image, the Master.","As a kid from Compton, you can get all the success in the world and still question your worth.","Sonnymoon and Quadrants are a couple of bands that really inspire me in terms of the melodics of things and certain tones and just what feels good. It takes me back to the type of music that I grew up on in my household. We played a lot of gangsta rap, but we also played a lot of oldies, and I think that mix is part of what inspires my sound.","My parents were fairly young in the city of Compton. So the things that they played - you know, that was the hip crowd. So I was being exposed to all these ideas, from Big Daddy Kane to Eazy-E to the Bay Area - Too Short, E-40 - you know, back to Marvin Gaye and the Isley Brothers.","I'm putting out this free music, constantly putting it out.","I'm selfish.","I used to consider the listener. But now I'm in a space where, if I'm not inspired, I can't really do the music. I can't feel it.","You don't hear no artists from Compton showing vulnerability.","I always felt like there was a certain standard of music that I had to do from the beginning, even when I didn't have the recognition that I have now.","I'm Machiavelli's offspring, I'm the king of New York, king of the coast, one hand, I juggle them both.","My mom's one of 13 siblings, and they all got six kids, and till I was 13 everybody was in Compton.","My folks ain't graduated from high school or nothing like that, so we always had to struggle in the family - and I come from a big family.","From the moment I started writing raps, I was always aware of the pressure. I always wanted to live up to how huge Snoop got, how huge Dre got, how huge Pac got. I was always aware.","I've got an extra-specific story about Dr. Dre. I saw him when I was 9 years old in Compton - him and Tupac. They were shooting the second 'California Love' video. My pops had seen him and ran back to the house and got me, put me on his neck, and we stood there watching Dre and Pac in a Bentley.","You can have the platinum album. But, you know, when you still feel like you haven't quite found your place in the world, it kind of gives a crazy offset.","When I'm in the studio, I'm looking for creativity I haven't matched yet, a feeling I haven't felt. It's a high.","Black and brown pride have been taught in my household for a long time.","Before finding music, I didn't have too many aspirations. I wanted to hang out, make a little money from whatever I had to do.","We're in the last days, man - I truly, in my heart, believe that. It's written. I could go on with biblical situations and things my grandma told me. But it's about being at peace with myself and making good with the people around me.","I don't really believe in the type of pressure that people are wanting to put on the type of music that I make.","In all my days of schooling, from preschool all the way up to 12th grade, there was not one white person in my class. Literally zero.","When I went back to my old high school, all these kids looking at me like I'm the real big homie, the same way I look at Jay Z, Nas, or Dr. Dre. You would've thought Michael Jackson walked through that joint off the excitement that they had.","When I ask OGs why there's so much division in the streets, nobody never really knows. But you know one thing that everybody always mention? A woman.","I think that's why I put my energy into making music. That's how I get my thoughts out, instead of being crazy all the time.","Tupac, Biggie, Jay. Your usual suspects. These were the people that was played in my household."],"Kendrick Meek":["We can make a difference. We can save lives. We can stop the genocide.","Looking at affordable health care, I think it is important that we look not only at prescription drugs, but also make sure that there is a major focus on health care.","The Coalition for International Justice estimated that 450,000 people in Darfur have died since the deadly genocide began some three years ago.","I think it is important also to recognize that our Customs border protection officers who secure our borders and conduct inspections of people in vehicles and cargo are also facing staffing shortages.","Making sure that health care is affordable for every American. I think that is very, very important.","We need to begin an all-out diplomatic offensive on Darfur in order to prepare the way for a peacekeeping force that can ensure protection for the people of Darfur.","In all, dozens upon dozens of groups and organizations have prioritized stopping the killing in Darfur before there is no one left to be killed. It is high time that we, the U.S. Congress, join our name to that list.","For Members of Congress, we are saying here on the Democratic side of the aisle we are not going to vote for another pay increase for Members of Congress until the American people get an increase.","It is sad that the Republican leadership is not as interested as they say they are in protecting the institution of marriage as they are in waging a campaign to divide and distract the American people from the real issues that need to be addressed.","Studies have consistently shown that financial hardship is the biggest obstacle to heterosexual marriage, yet the Republican leadership has done precious little to help address the financial hardship faced by American families.","The people of Florida in 2002 voted and approved class size limits in Florida to make sure that the State pays for smaller class sizes and not local districts.","I want to share with the American people that President Bush and the Republican majority in just 4 years have borrowed $1.05 trillion from foreign nations. That is selling our country to other nations because of the spending that is going on.","This election marks a significant moment in Haiti; it not only serves as the basis of hope along the road to democracy, but also serves as a testament to the resolve and character of the Haitian people during their long struggle for peace, reconciliation, and prosperity.","We have an immigration system in this country that not only doesn't work, in many cases it doesn't even make any sense.","Americans simply ask for, not just Democrats in the House but also the Senate has asked the President for a clear plan as it relates to dealing with the issue of Iraq and our troops and making sure that we can bring families together in the very near future.","Mrs. Parks' act of brave defiance rocked the foundation of American society and inspired generations of civil rights leaders and created a sense of hope for every American facing legal discrimination in this country.","Port Security is one of our weakest security links, and it must be one of our highest priorities.","Tens of thousands of South Florida jobs are dependent on the trade and commerce that our ports provide, and we have to make sure that we spend our security dollars wisely.","I'm not going sell out on the people of state of Florida."],"Kenelm Digby":["Note, that yeast of good Beer, is better then that of Ale.","Take to every Gallon of Honey, three Gallons of water, and put them both together, and set them over so soft a fire, that you may endure to melt and break the honey with your hands."],"Kenichi Fukui":["I was also interested in formulating the path of chemical reactions.","Chemistry itself knows altogether too well that - given the real fear that the scarcity of global resources and energy might threaten the unity of mankind - chemistry is in a position to make a contribution towards securing a true peace on earth.","But the nature of my main work in chemistry can be better represented by more than 280 English publications, of which roughly 200 concern the theory of chemical reactions and related subjects.","In particular, for younger researchers on whom the future of mankind may depend. We believe that they are working with all the scientific wisdom at their disposal for the preservation of the inheritance of the earth and for the lasting survival of mankind.","The frontier orbital approach was further developed in various directions by my own group and many other scientists, both theoretical and experimental.","This simple idea served to provide information on the geometrical shape of reacting molecules, and I was able to make the role of the frontier orbitals in chemical reactions more distinct through visualization, by drawing their diagrams.","This success led my theoretical group to the chemical reactivity theory, extending more and more widely the range of compound and reactions that were discussed.","We pray that every field of science may contribute in bringing happiness - not disaster - to human beings.","We think that it is the best scientists working in the frontier fields of science who are best able to judge what is good and what is bad - if any - in the application of their scientific research."],"Kenko Yoshida":["To sit alone in the lamplight with a book spread out before you, and hold intimate converse with men of unseen generations - such is a pleasure beyond compare.","A certain recluse, I know not who, once said that no bonds attached him to this life, and the only thing he would regret leaving was the sky.","The truth is at the beginning of anything and its end are alike touching.","Leave undone whatever you hesitate to do."],"Kenneth Anger":["I have a problem with censorship by the lawyer - by legal people by the publishing firm, and I may be changing publishers. They don't seem to want to take too many risks with living people.","The music rights at the time cost me $12,000 in 1964 money, which is about double now or whatever. But I cleared everything. I had a lawyer in New York. And it was cleared for use in a short subject, not a feature.","I've made several films that haven't been shown.","I've never made a film using dialogue or speech.","Nobody in America, in the modern generation, has read their mythology or legends.","Some very famous directors have started in the mail room, which is just getting inside the studio, getting to know people, getting to know the routine."],"Kenneth Arrow":["Not every business cycle has a financial crisis. Frequently they do.","I was graduated in 1940 with a degree of Bachelor of Science in Social Science but a major in Mathematics, a paradoxical combination that was prognostic of my future interests.","That economic decisions are made without certain knowledge of the consequences is pretty self-evident. But, although many economists were aware of this elementary fact, there was no systematic analysis of economic uncertainty until about 1950.","The major driver of economics is the equilibrium approach, which has taken various forms over the years. General equilibrium is the statement that all the different parts of the economy influence each other, even if it's remote, like mortgage-backed securities and their demands on automobiles.","Any purchase is one for the future. If you buy a refrigerator, you are making a commitment to the future so that you have food to eat for the next ten years."],"Kenneth Baker":["Privatization came on slowly. When something very big happens, like privatization, historians and economists like to think you must have had very big causes. That is not how it happened.","He has conferred on the practice of vacillation the aura of statesmanship.","Socialists make the mistake of confusing individual worth with success. They believe you cannot allow people to succeed in case those who fail feel worthless.","By the end of the 1970s Britain was in a mess.","So all the system was running down and collapsing. Mrs. Thatcher became the leader of the Conservative Party in February 1975, and she clearly wanted to strike out and do something different.","It was always said that the big distinction between the French and the English is that the English are intelligent and the French are intellectual."],"Kenneth Blackwell":["We have a system that allows us to manage a free and fair election, free of fraud, free of intimidation, and that's what we delivered on election day, and we're very very proud of it.","The reason it takes us from November the second to December the sixth to certify is because we have a very tedious, very comprehensive process where we audit by precinct, across the state, every vote that was cast to make sure that every vote that was legally cast is counted.","And I'm very proud of the 50,000 poll workers and election officials who delivered a free and fair election.","And we have the most scrutinized election system in the United States, and we have met every test.","I am running for Governor of the great state of Ohio and welcome your support.","I have nothing to do with counting the votes.","I would anticipate that the Electoral College will be held on the 13th of December, and our 20 electorate votes will go to the certified winner.","In order to spur economic growth we need to put the brakes on out of control spending, lower Ohioans tax burden and create a most efficient and effective government.","Job creation requires a business friendly environment with a tax structure that is not punitive and a state government designed for efficient use of fewer tax dollars.","Once they ask for a recount, we will provide them with a recount.","The fact of the matter is that they are entitled to request a recount. We're entitled to give them a recount.","They know, the courts know, the people know that they have no way of changing the results as it affects them.","They reality is that we have 70% of our voters use a punch card system that I tried to change and that bipartisan resistance in the legislature stopped.","We have 45,000 square miles of geography in Ohio.","You know, Jesse Jackson is just trying to stir up a hornet's nest."],"Kenneth Bonert":["When I was growing up, Mandela's name was synonymous with terror. We were scared of him. You couldn't see any photos of him. A photo of him could have gotten you in jail.","When I started to write realistic, real fiction, the voices that were the strongest for me - the characters that I heard, the people that I knew - were the ones from my childhood."],"Kenneth Branagh":["Lighten up, just enjoy life, smile more, laugh more, and don't get so worked up about things.","I'll tell you what I'm grateful for, and that's the clarity of understanding that the most important things in life are health, family and friends, and the time to spend on them.","How many times do you read about 'the Cinderella story,' the story of the underdog, the story of the ordinary human being, often subjected to cruelty and ignorance and neglect, who somehow triumphs?","I think that short films often contain an originality, a creative freedom, an energy and an invention that is inspiring and entertaining. I think they are, as Shakespeare put it, a good deed in a naughty world.","I am very much looking forward to new adventures - including, I hope, Broadway - sooner rather than later.","Sometimes I used to think to myself, 'Have I lost a sense of humor?' but I don't think that I have. I think one can be as snarky and sarcastic as lots of people, but I have never found that it makes me particularly happy.","Life is surreal and beautiful.","I had a friend who introduced me to a meditation practice which involves a couple of half-hours a day of meditation, where essentially you try to achieve a stillness that allows you to just be there in the moment.","I come from the theatre; my bones are in the theatre. It's as natural as breathing to want to be in the theatre.","One of the things that makes Hamlet unique among Shakespeare's characters is his courage to face up to the darker elements of his personality.","Life is about making plans from which you deviate, almost always. If you are lucky, you do come up with a plan.","I think the best actors are the most generous, the kindest, the greatest people and at their worst they are vain, greedy and insecure.","I was stuck in a wheelchair playing this deranged villain. I felt this mass amount of rage at being so confined. I thought, 'What can I do that is the direct opposite of this situation?' The only thing I could think of was that I could sing and dance.","Friendship is one of the most tangible things in a world which offers fewer and fewer supports.","I think that music is crucially important in Shakespeare - and, clearly, was an important part of the Elizabethan theatre. And, it's always been something that was a profound element of the experience of Shakespeare that I have been drawn to - and interpreters have, as well.","I don't think Hamlet is mad, nor is he predisposed to be a gloomy or tragic figure.","I suppose, at 50, you value things in a different way. So you value connections, you value your friendships, you value your health, and you are much more aware of time passing.","I think we love the escapism of something like 'Cinderella,' and I think we do with 'Thor.'","My definition of success is control.","The best actors, I think, have a childlike quality. They have a sort of an ability to lose themselves. There's still some silliness.","Actors are the best and the worst of people. They're like kids. When they're good, they're very very good. When they're bad they're very very naughty.","I'm basically quite a cheerful person.","What I've found about 'Cinderella' is that what it provokes in an audience is really extraordinary. It appears to be a deceptively simple tale, but I've heard nothing but people drawing all different things out of it.","My experience of great storytelling, working with classics, is just finding a way to present it simply but let the story do its own work, or be an invite to the audience's imagination.","Certainly, I'm excited by epic subjects. It doesn't particularly frighten me.","If it's good art, it's good.","I choose to be inspired by things that have been done well in the past. So, I don't worry about being compared, because I think that does paralyze you.","I have a pathetic urge at some stage in my life to be able to pull out my wallet and pull out a little card on which it would say, 'Kenneth Branagh, artistic director.'","I'm very conscious of the fact the directing career has taken some odd turns. Maybe there's enough bulk where I'm now pigeonholed in the 'eclectic box.'","In Northern Ireland, I truly, effortlessly, knew who I was. I knew where I belonged. I felt completely and utterly secure.","I fondly remember good times working on 'Thor.'","Shakespeare's always on my dance card if it can be.","To look out of a car in Scania, you see a painting on the horizontal - one windmill, one tiny farmhouse, acres of beet or grass.","I've lived a lot of my life in London, so I often feel that I am a Londoner.","For what it's worth, I enjoy 'Dexter,' 'Modern Family,' 'True Blood' and 'Breaking Bad.' I've enjoyed the wonderful 'The Pacific.'","I think A Midsummer Night's Dream would be terrific because of the transformations that occur. Or The Tempest, things like that. Extraordinary larger than life or supernatural element.","I certainly have been guilty of trying to sweep things under the carpet.","Being Irish, I always had this love of words.","The elasticity of Shakespeare is extraordinary.","Many of us live in dysfunctional families, and so even if it's in a fairy tale, or perhaps because it's in a fairy tale, we have a chance to look at that side of our reflected lives differently.","We're self obsessed and mad and stupid - not that other people can't be the same way - but the extremes are kind of honest in some mad way. Anyway, I like them.","There is some mysterious thing that goes on whereby, in the process of playing Shakespeare continuously, actors are surprised by the way the language actually acts on them.","The long version of the play is actually an easier version to follow. In all of the cut versions the intense speeches are cut too close together for the audience and the actors.","The glory of 70mm is the sharpness of the image it offers.","So many plays with magic in them that would be a terrific invitation to an imaginative animation team.","Music and language are a vital element. We, as actors and directors, offer it to people who want to experience it. Sometimes the actual meaning is less important than the words themselves.","It's very strange that the people you love are often the people you're most cruel to.","It's quite hard for people to just accept that they're very contradictory.","In the hands of a great poet, words have ways of affecting us in ways we don't understand.","If you've done a brilliant version it becomes something else.","I only really cast people who are desperate to be in it - who were dying to be in it, whose talent I believed in and were dead ready to do the work that was necessary.","I like to cast actors I admire, one's that are talented. Each one will bring something new to the part. This play has been done thousands of times and now certain characters are too familiar.","I don't know that there is too far, actually. I think there's only too bad. If it's bad you've gone too far.","I do think that, for instance, we've been very lucky to have theatrical careers and be associated with Shakespeare which sometimes gives you a kind of bogus kudos.","I did not make this a long film for its own sake. I wanted to make an entertaining film and offer it out there for those who want to see it. If word of mouth suggests there is an audience out there, hopefully their cinema will show it.","Variety is very, very good. Going from medium to medium, if you get the chance to do it, from theater to television to film, which are all distinctly different, keeps me sharp. What works in one doesn't work in the other, and you have to be looking for the truth of the performance, whatever way that medium might demand.","I feel more Irish than English. I feel freer than British, more visceral, with a love of language. Shot through with fire in some way. That's why I resist being appropriated as the current repository of Shakespeare on the planet. That would mean I'm part of the English cultural elite, and I am utterly ill-fitted to be.","I started being interested in acting when I heard the voices of Sir Laurence Olivier and Sir John Gielgud and Sir Alec Guinness. I've had the great privilege of working with Sir Derek Jacobi and Sir Anthony Hopkins. These are people who inspire the work that I do.","There are some amazing stories from all over this country, where people's work and contribution has been acknowledged. To be part of that is an absolutely fantastic feeling.","I don't find myself so exercised by a desperation to be new.","I remember the first book I bought, when I was about 11... Dad said, 'What have you got that for? What are libraries for?'","My dad, for the first 15 years of my career, on every visit he made to a play or a film set, would find the oldest person on set and say, 'Do you think my son has a future?'","The BAFTA is both absolutely fantastic and sort of meaningless at the same time.","My parents are the reason I wanted to make Shakespeare available to ordinary people.","I did not expect to be allowed to be an actor, to be allowed to eventually direct things.","I only got 'War and Peace' on the third attempt.","A brother who is unhappy is a dangerous relative to have.","I'm by no means an opera buff.","Mozart had a tremendously fertile and creative ear for a catchy tune.","I think in the wake of the domination of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, everyone is now looking for a grand plan.","I did 'Celebrity' by Woody Allen. I did 'The Gingerbread Man' with Robert Altman. These were big talents.","I've always loved the Bond films.","The idea of accumulating ambitions or achievements didn't get much further than wanting to do the next exciting thing. I really haven't set out with any list of achievements.","For a nanosecond in the pre-Internet pre-digital age, I was a hot young actor, in the sense of popular, and then it passed.","I'm involved in Northern Ireland Screen and have been for a long time, so I keep my eyes open and ears to the ground.","'The Painkiller' is a remarkable play.","Sir Derek Jacobi has been an inspiration to so many actors and audiences throughout his brilliant career. To see him in Shakespeare is an event in itself.","Probably 90 percent of the stuff I make has inevitably been done before... Whether it's playing Hamlet, which has been on the go for 400 years, or pieces from the cinematic world that also have been essayed before, I feel released by that."],"Kenneth Burke":["For no continuity of social act is possible without a corresponding social status and the many different kinds of act required in an industrial state, with its high degree of specialization, make for corresponding classification of status.","Dignity belongs to the conquered.","We not only interpret the character of events... we may also interpret our interpretations.","Our purpose is simply to ask how theological principles can be shown to have usable secular analogues that throw light upon the nature of language.","Creation implies authority in the sense of originator. The possibility of a 'Fall' is implied in a Covenant insofar as the idea of a Covenant implies the possibility of its being violated.","Men seek for vocabularies that are reflections of reality. To this end, they must develop vocabularies that are selections of reality. And any selection of reality must, in certain circumstances, function as a deflection of reality."],"Kenneth C. Griffin":["Gambling is entertainment... Financial markets, what one often refers to as speculation, is really the force by which we move capital to the best and highest use.","Business is business. I don't manufacture cars, but we do manufacture money.","It's a winner-take-all world.","Blockchain's a very interesting technology that will have some very profound applications for society over the years to come.","You can't succeed in the markets today unless you are part of a great team. The team is the essence of how you win.","I had to learn to trust people, and I realized that success was going to be born in hiring really bright people - very self-motivated, very able to make good judgment calls day in and day out.","It is often constructive to meet with a candidate for a particular office, but I believe what is most important is the candidate's track record.","The resources at Harvard - its professors, our fellow students, the libraries, its alumni - created for me the opportunity to pursue my passions in finance.","As Americans, I think we really believe that with the meritocracy that exists in our country, the equality of opportunity is so important to the foundation of our culture and our society.","It is my hope that visitors, artists, and students from around the world will experience all that MoMA has to offer for generations to come.","I've often thought of successful entrepreneurs as individuals who have just the right expertise - at just the right moment - to solve the emerging problems of their time.","When you read that UBS did not even view parts of its mortgage portfolio as having market risk, it becomes very obvious that a number of firms were not dotting the i's and crossing the t's when it comes to risk management.","Senator Rubio is uniquely qualified to lead our nation with conviction and courage to tackle the pressing issues of our time, whether it's strengthening our military, ensuring the safety of our people, or lifting the weight of government from our shoulders.","When a company creates a product that directly or indirectly adversely impacts the health of people, that product must be regulated. The process by which it's created must be regulated. No company has the right to injure people. No company.","We don't have a good legal justification for breaking up the banking system. But if I could wave a magic wand, I'd break up the banking system.","Almost all politicians are able to have a great one-on-one meeting. But I'm not interested in the candidate who can have a great meeting. I'm interested in the person who can make the right decisions.","I don't feel I'm at liberty to speak about the actions of any one CEO. That's not fair; given CEOs have duties to their shareholders.","Investors who find the best businesses to put their money behind are rewarded for their research.","I set up my own trading center in my Cabot dorm room... with my computer, my fax machine, and my telephone.","Citadel's Capital Market division plays an important role in our nation's financial markets. Our broker-dealer is the largest market maker in options in the United States, executing approximately 30 percent of all equity option trades daily.","In some industries, we refer to risk taking as 'research and development.' At financial institutions, we often take risk by investing in securities.","It is not my belief that we need greater government regulation of hedge funds with respect to the systemic risk they create.","We don't have a good legal justification for breaking up the banking system.","If I could wave a magic wand, I'd break up the banking system.","I did not forsee a day where the government had to intervene to bail out basically everybody.","Don't act like a bank unless you are a bank. That was a really big lesson learned from 2008.","The culture of rigorous questioning and open discourse at the University of Chicago has opened minds to ideas that have changed the world.","Should we think about separating the investment banks from the commercial banks, a new Glass-Steagall?

Tension creates change. Change is necessary to evolve and prosper. I am never satisfied.","Long ago, I had to sort of learn to have a thick skin to read some of the things you read in the papers and to also keep my ego in check when you read some really flattering things in the papers.","Let me be clear: All I really care about is my kids know that their parents love them.","It drives people nuts that I take them to McDonald's all the time.","For choice, I prefer not to be a public figure.

I wish we would end 'too big to fail' in our banking system.","Those who have enjoyed the benefits of our system more than ever now owe a duty to protect the system that has created the greatest nation on this planet.","I think if you look at the realm we're discussing, which is the political realm, I think it would be impossible to find an action by any politician intended to specifically favor either my firm or myself.","I have an economics degree from Harvard.","If you think about the amount of critical thinking that has come into the field of economics, two universities have dominated the landscape in my life: Chicago and Harvard.","The success story at Citadel has been written by a number of people who have backgrounds from the University of Chicago.","I have known Senator Rubio for a number of years, and he is an inspiring, courageous, and bold leader who embodies the American dream of freedom and equal opportunity for all.","The key to our business, it's a lot of research.","We think that excellence in investing comes from focus.","There will come a time and place it will be appropriate for us to consider going public.","I'm the CEO; I'm the one who should be looking out for risk.","It's important for me to be No. 1.","As an industry, we have a responsibility to manage risk in a way that is prudent.","Walk across any of the trading floors - they are full of 29-year-old kids.

Engage in principle compromise. And understand your job is to find solutions.","What's increasingly clear is that when you are open to a discussion of leadership, and you're relating it to your company, it is much easier to get people to become open.","For me, integrity is the consistency of words and actions. Part of the way that you do that is to ask people questions on some of the most difficult issues that you confront. 'Take me through where you felt you had to compromise your values.'","You've got to develop relationships. You can't do things just in a formal context.","At the end the day because I believe so strongly in leadership, what I look for first, what I try to assess, is integrity.","Regular feedback is one of the hardest things to drive through an organization.","I say this all the time: Everyone can make a conscious choice to be a leader.","Companies will need to pursue a more diversified business model, but I think those companies that have what I call a focused diversified business model will be more successful.","For a number of major companies, if you can't access the commercial markets, you can't fund your business. That's a big problem. You can't pay your bills.","For me, one of the lessons from 9/11 is that you have to give the organization context for how you're acting, and you've got to communicate constantly, in this case particularly with all the changes that were occurring in the financial marketplace and in the economy.","I was attracted to law school because I believed it would help me prepare for a career in the real world.","Harvard Law provided an opportunity to learn from a faculty that had shaped the laws of our country and helped to change the world around us. It also offered an opportunity to study with the brightest students and to test myself against the best.","My plans were to practice law and then possibly go into public service.","I moved back to Boston and joined some of my Harvard classmates at Bain & Co. I quickly realized I enjoyed business.","There are clearly some policies that need to change, and the reputation of the credit card industry is not high. Reforms need to take place.","I had very little exposure to business growing up. I also was very focused on the Civil Rights Movement. And I saw law as a vehicle to really bring about substantial change.","I've always tried to seek out environments with excitement.","Small businesses create half of the jobs in the private sector.","If people support independently owned small businesses in their community, they can make a difference.","I've always been a very competitive person.","I think what's important to understand is if the United States hits the debt ceiling and is unable to pay its debts, the consequences will be immediate and dramatic.","My message to Washington is the United States has gone through incredible crises, and our leaders have been able to find common ground. And that's what our leaders have to do.","There was a strong focus on performance and respect for people. And one of the points that my father always made was that with all the challenges and obstacles and barriers, the one thing you can control is your performance. And that is one thing I have tried to adhere to throughout my career."],"Kenneth Choi":["Chicago is my hometown and will always have a special place in my heart.","When I filmed my episodes, the show hadn't aired yet, so there was no 'Glee' pandemonium. It was still untested.","Portland is the perfect weekend getaway. I studied acting in Portland and lived there for five years. It's a small city with so much to do. There's beautiful scenery, a great bar scene, and so many fabulous restaurants.","When I work, I like to just kind of stay quiet, stay to myself. I like to walk around a lot and figure out what's gonna happen in the scene and try to get my head straight.","The entire time I was in Portland, which was the five years, I had absolutely no contact with any of my family.","When I moved to Los Angeles, I figured I'm really going to make an attempt to become a real actor. And when I did that, I thought it was time for me to face my parents and tell them what I did.","My dad does watch my work now. My parents watch everything I'm on. I think the first time they saw something was 'Captain America,' and he called me, and he was so elated.","I told my extremely conservative, uber-traditional Korean father, 'Hey, Dad, I know what I want to do for the rest of my life. I want to be an actor.'","I think I can sing, but that does not mean I can actually sing. I fear that I'm like one of those 'American Idol' contestants who truly believe they are good and are actually dreadful.","I collected X-Men, Spider-Man, and Daredevil comics. I definitely had a few Captain America comics lying around in those protective plastic baggies.","When you're working on a huge, elaborate set that took months to create, and you're surrounded by hundreds of extras, you better remember your lines and know what you're doing in a scene!","I am proud to say that I plastic-wrapped Bruno Ricci's toilet in his trailer.","Comic fans are some of the toughest fans to please, and I'm one of them.","Belize has a tropical climate and is quite affordable and is developing a reputation as an inexpensive Hawaii. If you want to hide away someplace that is extremely low-key, Placencia is perfect. San Pedro is more touristy and modernized.","I'd like to visit my friend and his family who live in Australia. That trip is long overdue."],"Kenneth Clark":["Children who are treated as if they are uneducable almost invariably become uneducable.","The great achievement of the Catholic Church lay in harmonizing, civilizing the deepest impulses of ordinary, ignorant people.","All great civilizations, in their early stages, are based on success in war.","We can destroy ourselves by cynicism and disillusion, just as effectively as by bombs.","A lot of people you think you know you don't know until you find out you don't know then it may be too late to know.","No nude, however abstract, should fail to arouse in the spectator some vestige of erotic feeling, even if it be only the faintest shadow - and if it does not do so it is bad art and false morals.","To hurry through the rise and fall of a fine, full sentence is like defying the role of time in human life.","Opera, next to Gothic architecture, is one of the strangest inventions of Western man. It could not have been foreseen by any logical process."],"Kenneth Clarke":["I am sorry to upset my colleagues by saying we wasted four years in opposition, but if you do get so badly defeated as a party you do have to face up to some painful facts and you do have to change.","It would be immoral to walk away from the consequences of our actions, leaving behind anarchy and civil war in Iraq.","Energetic action on debt would make a radical difference to the prospects of many of the poorest countries in the world, at no practical cost to creditor countries.","I cannot remember a time in opposition - I am talking about the last four years - when we have done less work on policy and more on slogans. But because of my European views I wasn't allowed to participate.","However, we do not lack anti-terrorist laws. I do not believe that the recent London bombs were the result of any deficiencies in our legal system.","I am getting frustrated by the fact that we have been out of office for eight years. I desperately want to lead the Conservative Party to make quicker progress back into power.","I don't think at my age... you can start ruling people out in politics.","If the prime minister really believes it, he must be the only person left who thinks that the recent bombs in London had no connection at all with his policy in Iraq.","My sense is that the majority of Conservatives share my reservations about how we got into Iraq.","Of course I'd have loved to be Prime Minister. But I'm not nursing a grievance.","The Blair government has lowered the standing of politics and politicians in our country.","The political health of Britain has deteriorated very sharply. The Conservative Party must do something about it. I am the man to do it."],"Kenneth Cranham":["Buying a particular vintage because everyone tips it and then waiting for it to mature is like gambling. The thrill is in placing the bet. Once the race is run or the match is played, you'll either win or lose. Until that happens, you're caught in this wonderful, agonising sense of expectation.","Great wine is always enhanced by great food.","Cinema dominated the Fife coalfield towns. We lived in Lochgelly, but my mum was caught up in Hollywood. She was in love with the style and glamour. Sometimes she would come with me to the cinema in the afternoons, and she would say things like, 'I wouldn't mind a peck with Gregory.'","I had a whole Scottish existence until we moved to London when I was four.","I feel at home in Scotland and go back whenever I can. I've played the Edinburgh Festival twice, and I get the train across the Forth Bridge to Lochgelly, just to see it.","If you swap it about, do television, theatre, film, you can go on surprising yourself. The problem is you get employed to do something you've already done. They want something from that sheep pen of performances they've seen you do.","You create a blueprint of your best performance, and you're happiest the night you surpass that blueprint. That won't happen that often, but it will happen. It's like sculpting: you keep refining. When you have a piece that is yours, that is just you, that becomes obsessive; you think about it all the time.","I was fantastically well versed by the time I left school. I had a teacher who put 'A Clockwork Orange' my way, and 'Catcher in the Rye.'","You have to succeed as a young actor, then as a dad actor, those would be my 'Harvey Moon' years, then as an old actor.","When you act for a living, you are lucky enough to get to say things you really want to say. You get lines that you look forward to, lines that jump out like a jack-in-the-box; you're thinking: 'Wait till you hear this.'","I've always liked texts that you immediately understand. I suppose the playwrights who really speak to me are Edward Bond, Joe Orton and Harold Pinter. I've been in six different Pinter productions - I love the clarity of his language. He has this way of using words - there's a thrill to them.","The great thing about stage is that you have more control. The stage is yours. The time is yours. Film is really the editor's medium.","The thing about theatre is that when it is actually occurring, when you have the audience on your side, you absolutely think you can will them to do anything. It's exhilarating.","Christopher Plummer once told me that he never orders a wine without first confirming that the restaurant has a second bottle in case he loves it.","The only acting I knew when I was a boy came from Lochgelly. With a double bill, people would live their lives in the cinema. You would even see babies being breastfed in the audience.","When I was in Lochgelly as a boy, I went to the cinema every night - and on Sundays, I used to go to Cowdenbeath and see something there.","My grandfather, Harry Ferguson, was a butcher in Hill of Beath; so even though my grandparents lived in some poverty, we got loads of beef. My grandmother, Meg, was a fine Scottish cook who did slow cooking.","The first thing I wanted to do, as a boy, was to be a skier, because I had seen film footage of somebody skiing."],"Kenneth Edmonds":["But a lot of the old fans are listening to a lot of the younger music. So I gotta keep moving forward, and they'll move forward too.","It's like spicy food - sometimes you have to tone it down so more people can enjoy it.","The whole process of this record was an education for me as a musician.","Commercial music, for the most part, is popular music and you always have to keep that in mind.","Unfortunately, a lot of executives aren't like producers, and can't hear the diamond in the rough.","It might be a huge hit, it might not; but you learn something doing it.","The most exciting thing for all of us is movies and movie stars.","I don't necessarily want people to know all my intimate feelings about Tracey.","I could easily not be the person that people know.","When I was in top 40 bands, I always had to learn new material and new styles.","The reality is, some people don't want you to change or go anywhere different.","There's artists that I'm working with on a new label of mine. Foxy Nova and Supa Nova.","I still write the same way and have the same perspective.","I usually prepare a track and then I work with the artist when it's time to do the vocals.","I enjoy music that is commercial.","I think that in order for music to be heard in a lot of different situations you have to always consider that.","I don't go to that many Broadway shows, so I can't really say anything.","I would say that I've been lucky. Being blessed and not really ever giving up.","I think that whenever there's a good script we try to make that happen, but it's all based off of a good story, a good script, but I don't believe you should do it just because it's African-American.","There are people that bring artists to me to look at it and it's a question of whether I like their music and their look and if I think there's something they have that makes them different and commercial.","I'm continuing to produce and will start a new record soon, as well.","It's about finding great artists and being part of their careers.","The Internet is a whole new world opening up.","You can find a diamond in the rough a lot of times."],"Kenneth Fisher":["Having different types of stocks in your portfolio can enhance returns.","What is the most common investor mistake? Trading - getting in and getting out at all the wrong times, for all the wrong reasons.","The stock market is a discounter of all known information.","I never liked quantitative easing. It's misunderstood by almost everybody. Flattening the yield curve is not stimulative; flattening the yield curve is anti-stimulative.","The bubble, as investing phenomenon, has been well studied ever since the 17th-century tulip bulb frenzy. Its counterpart in bear markets is not well understood.","Indeed, bull markets are fueled by successive waves of prior skeptics finally capitulating as their fears fade. Eventually, fear turns to euphoria, and that's the stuff of bubbles.","The world is filled with successful small businesses that stay small.","Environmentalists should like fracking for its relative cleanliness. But they don't. They have made a bugaboo out of the chemicals in fracking fluids, which supposedly can leach into groundwater sources. I'm convinced they're dead wrong. Ultimately, good technology with a cost advantage will win out over paranoia.","Buy into good, well-researched companies and then wait. Let's call it a sit-on-your-hands investment strategy.","Windmills and solar cells are carbon-free sources of electricity. But they are costly. If you've been investing in those, give it up. That game is effectively over.","I'm sometimes accused of being hostile to mutual funds. That's not fair, really. There is a place for them. Still, I am hostile to one thing, which is trying to use funds to time your way in and out of the market. That's a recipe for very bad results.","The more you talk about investing problems, the worse you feel. Instead of complaining, it's better to do something.","I've long loved emerging markets airlines because they usually sell at bargain prices. The troubled history of developed market airlines unfairly taints these stocks. In the emerging world, they're growth stocks.","If you're 35, 45, or even 55 - you have a very long time horizon - 40 years or vastly more. That is you, and/or your spouse, are likely to live about that long, and you'll be investing the whole way.","A constant in my approach to investing: You should think politically but unconventionally.","When the economies of emerging markets don't just grow but beat expectations, there's scarcely a mention.","All equity categories, correctly calculated, create near-identical lifelong returns. They just get there via wildly differing paths.","The latter part of bull markets are typically led by stocks that are seen then as high quality, but the ones that do best are the ones that weren't seen as such high quality before.","Normally, if you have a huge category that leads a bear market all the way down to the bottom - like tech after 2000, or energy in the '80-'82 bear market - you get one quick pop, and then years of lag as we fight the old war.","People do dollar cost averaging because they have regret of making one big mistake. But the fact of the matter is that, mathematically, the market rises more of the time than it falls. It falls, but it rises more of the time than it falls.","If you can predict where the market's going, just do what you can predict. If you can't, which is the presumption of dollar cost averaging or time cost averaging, either one, then you're trying to ease in. But if the market rises more than it falls most of the time, easing in is, by definition, a loser's game.","Anyone can see how if a feared tax hike doesn't happen, that's a positive factor. But even if tax hikes happen as feared, vast history tells me it doesn't have to have the big bad impact folks fear. And fear of a false factor is always bullish.","Readers regularly ask what can go wrong but almost never what could positively surprise.","Investors covet past improvements but also always believe pricing unimaginable future creativity and efficiency gains is Pollyannaish. And they're always wrong. Bet on it.","If some stock categories get too hot-and-pricey, mass supply is created via stock offerings to tap that cheap money - and, when overdone, drives it all down.","You may have seen my firm's ads screaming, 'I Hate Annuities.' Folks ask why we run them. Simple: Because I do.","When I was a young man in the 1970s, tech firms were scattered across the developed world. Since then, America has come to dominate tech almost totally.","Over rolling long periods, U.S. and non-U.S. stocks tend to equalize.","Back in the '60s and '70s, data were scarce, and while analysts knew that companies with fat gross margins lagged those with thin gross margins early in bull markets - and overachieved in the later phases - they couldn't do much about it.","Long before folks fretted the demise of 'quantitative easing,' I fretted its existence. It proved the reverse of its image, an antistimulus, and we've done okay not because of it, but despite it.","Both cheap value stocks and more glamorous growth stocks can work well in a portfolio - if done right.","Generally, variations in earnings aren't nearly as impactful on glamour growth stocks as are changes in image and, well, sexiness. I often think of glamour stocks as though they are attractive women dressing to the nines.","Fundamentally cheap stocks are often held in low regard by market participants. Something may be tainting their perception in investors' minds.","The average mutual fund holding period for equity or fixed income is only about three years. It's too short.","Hundreds of investors ask me questions each year about the dilemmas they confront. Their worst problem? Uncertainty. They are traumatized and become emotional or confused to the state of inaction. Even worse, they try to solve a short-term problem in a way that hurts them financially in the long run.","If you are prepared for some risk, junk bonds pay about 5%, but they tend to get whacked when interest rates rise. Same with lower-yielding but higher-quality corporate bonds.","To me 'The Big Easy' is shorthand for owning big stocks that are easy for wary investors to buy into. These stocks tend to outperform during the back half of bull markets.","If you've taken Econ 101, you know that the quantity of money rises only when the banking system makes a net loan.","My father, Philip Fisher, was the toughest guy I ever knew. An example: He had terrible teeth, yet he got his fillings done without ever using a painkiller. Now, that's tough!","Buying only what you know can end in disaster. Just think about Enron's employees and business partners, the 'locals' who bought lots of its stock because they thought they were in the know.","China frequently confounds stock market prognosticators because it has a penchant for straying markedly from other broad global indexes year-by-year over the decades - even from emerging markets. It's hit or miss.","China's stock market is inextricably tied to politics.","Italians have always had a high savings rate. They love putting their money into their own government bonds - even more than in houses, stocks and gold. The higher rates climb, the happier they are to invest. So if austerity plans drive rates up, it's music to Italian ears.","One component of the leading economic indicators is the yield curve. Bond investors keep a close eye on this, as it illustrates the spread or difference between long-term interest rates and short-term ones.","Many follow a rule of thumb - no more than 5% in one stock. But that's not the entrepreneurial road to riches.","Plenty of funds have fine long-term returns despite being tax-inefficient and generally costly. But a dirty secret is this: Average, no-load fund investors do much worse than the funds - or the market.","Despite its many critics, hydraulic fracturing will change the nature of energy production.","Fracking opens up vast tracts of the U.S. to exploitation by gas drillers. There's enough energy under our feet to last us for decades, maybe centuries.","Most investors give too much credence to the theory that prices are rational; they presume that a market collapse must have been justified by serious economic trouble.","I can find only one bull market, in 1935, that didn't have some material indigestion within its first 12 months.","I've done well over time but made lots of mistakes, too. Learn from your mistakes.","Originally, I thought Republican. Now I'm an equal opportunity politician-hater.","In the early days, I promoted the idea of spending time in libraries to gain facts that other investors didn't have. Not many people did that kind of research, so it worked.","In history, the evidence is overwhelming: Stock market bottoms happen, and then stocks jolt upwards while the economy keeps getting worse - sometimes by a lot and for a long time.","Global stocks bottomed in June 1921, but global economies didn't hit bottom for fully two more years.","The upward move at the beginning of a bull market is almost always huge compared with the vacillations late in the bear market. If you try to pick a bottom, you will miss a good part of the action.","My firm has 25,000 high-net-worth clients. A typical account would be that of a couple aged 65 and 60 who need their money to last the rest of their lives, 25 to 35 years.","In a bubble, anyone who argues pessimistically is seen as crazy.","In the world I've known most of my life, old stories quickly lose their power over capital markets and get replaced by new surprises. That which everyone fixates on gets priced into the stock market quickly and can't drag on.","Normally, the market peaks before bad news emerges. That's what happened in 1929, and that's what happened in 2000."],"Kenneth Frampton":["You could draw certain parallels between the structure of the Pompidou and the structure of the rocket-launching facilities at Cape Canaveral. They might not have been thinking about it, but I think there is some kind of unconscious affinity there.","Many of the received models of modern architecture and planning owe their ultimate origin to the building code and public health reform movements of the second half of the 19th century.","From the Berlin tenement reform law of 1897 to H. P. Berlage's plan for Amsterdam South of 1917, designers and theorists in Germany and Holland moved toward the development of a perimeter residential block that would preserve the plastic continuity of the street while opening up the resultant courtyard for use as an enclosed semi-public space."],"Kenneth G. Wilson":["In consequence, science is more important than ever for industrial technology.","The scientist's inquiry into the causes of things is providing an ever more extensive understanding of nature.","My father was on the faculty in the Chemistry Department of Harvard University; my mother had one year of graduate work in physics before her marriage.","My grandfather on my mother's side was a professor of mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; my other grandfather was a lawyer, and one time Speaker of the Tennessee House of Representatives.","My graduate studies were carried out at the California Institute of Technology.","While at Cal Tech I talked a lot with Jon Mathews, then a junior faculty member; he taught me how to use the Institute's computer; we also went on hikes together.","In 1975 I met Alison Brown and in 1982 we were married. She works for Cornell Computer Services.","One other hobby of mine has been playing the oboe but I have not kept this up after 1969.","The Nobel award occasions a unique celebration of the vision of science by the public at large. The prestige the prize confers today is largely due to the extraordinary diligence of the Nobel committees.","Industry now should become a full partner of government in supporting longrange basic research.","Through this additional support, we must renew our commitment to provide talented young people with the opportunity to build scientific careers based on their curiosity, the same opportunity that was provided to me when I began my work.","The hardest problems of pure and applied science can only be solved by the open collaboration of the world-wide scientific community.","Scientists under all forms of government must be able to participate fully in international efforts."],"Kenneth Grahame":["After all, the best part of a holiday is perhaps not so much to be resting yourself, as to see all the other fellows busy working.","There is nothing - absolutely nothing - half so much worth doing as simply messing about in boats.","Badger hates Society, and invitations, and dinner, and all that sort of thing.","Monkeys who very sensibly refrain from speech, lest they should be set to earn their livings.","Independence is all very well, but we animals never allow our friends to make fools of themselves beyond a certain limit; and that limit you've reached.","Spring was moving in the air above and in the earth below and around him, penetrating even his dark and lowly little house with its spirit of divine discontent and longing.","The Wild Wood is pretty well populated by now; with all the usual lot, good, bad, and indifferent - I name no names. It takes all sorts to make a world.","Slowly, but with no doubt or hesitation whatever, and in something of a solemn expectancy, the two animals passed through the broken tumultuous water and moored their boat at the flowery margin of the island.","The clever men at Oxford, know all that there is to be knowed. But they none of them know one half as much, as intelligent Mr. Toad.","Animals arrived, liked the look of the place, took up their quarters, settled down, spread, and flourished. They didn't bother themselves about the past - they never do; they're too busy.","Animals when in company walk in a proper and sensible manner, in single file, instead of sprawling all across the road and being of no use or support to each other in case of sudden trouble or danger.","It's never the wrong time to call on Toad. Early or late he's always the same fellow. Always good-tempered, always glad to see you, always sorry when you go!","The whole wood seemed running now, running hard, hunting, chasing, closing in round something or - somebody? In panic, he began to run too, aimlessly, he knew not whither.","Toad talked big about all he was going to do in the days to come, while stars grew fuller and larger all around them, and a yellow moon, appearing suddenly and silently from nowhere in particular, came to keep them company and listen to their talk.","Well, very long ago, on the spot where the Wild Wood waves now, before ever it had planted itself and grown up to what it now is, there was a city - a city of people, you know.","When it began to grow dark, the Rat, with an air of excitement and mystery, summoned them back into the parlour, stood each of them up alongside of his little heap, and proceeded to dress them up for the coming expedition.","A careful inspection showed them that, even if they succeeded in righting it by themselves, the cart would travel no longer. The axles were in a hopeless state, and the missing wheel was shattered into pieces.","The Mole had long wanted to make the I acquaintance of the Badger. He seemed, by all accounts, to be such an important personage and, though rarely visible, to make his unseen influence felt by everybody about the place."],"Kenneth H. Cooper":["The reason I exercise is for the quality of life I enjoy.","There are six components of wellness: proper weight and diet, proper exercise, breaking the smoking habit, control of alcohol, stress management and periodic exams.","If you look at body fat, it seems to increase with age, even though your weight does not. That's a physiological fact of aging, they say. Heck it is. It is an adaptive effect of aging.","We are involved in youth testing internationally. We want to try to prove without a shadow of a doubt the relationship between physical fitness and health, not just physical fitness and ability to perform.","So I've broadened the fitness concept to make it one of moderation and balance.","Aerobic dancing is already adjusting to injury problems and will probably phase out to some extent.","I have not missed a day from work because of illness since 1956.","According to the Gallup Poll, 24 percent of American adults exercised regularly in 1961, and 50 percent after 1968. The peak was 59 percent in 1984, dropping off to 51 percent last September.","After 26 years, I am still practicing what I preach.","Far too many times over the next 12 to 15 years, it was brought to my attention that people who followed my exercise guidelines exactly but ignored their diet, their weight and their cigarette smoking had heart attacks at age 55.","I don't criticize weight training - as long as it is not a substitute for aerobic training.","I think investments in general related to the exercise industry are going to be good for a long time.","I used to think that it didn't make any difference how far you ran if you had a good, strong musculoskeletal system and no underlying cardiovascular problems.","Now I say that if you run more than 15 miles a week, it's for something other than aerobic fitness. Once you pass 15 miles, you do not see much further improvement.","Over the years, I've covered 22,000 miles.","Since then, I have not missed five consecutive days in getting some type of aerobic exercise, mostly jogging.","You have to run 75 to 100 miles a week if you expect to break the four-minute mile."],"Kenneth Jay Lane":["I am myself a fabulous fake.","My mother, when I told her I was going into the jewelry business said, 'Kenneth, don't tell anyone.'","I'm not a designer, I'm an inventor.","If they made films in Palm Beach, actors and actresses would be much better dressed.","Men always like to please women. Women like to please men, too - some women. Some are very good at it.","A caveman took a shell, and maybe it had a hole in it, or maybe he put a hole in it, and he put it on a piece of a tail of a donkey or a dinosaur or something and gave it to the cavewoman. She put it around her neck - the first jewel."],"Kenneth Joseph Arrow":["My undergraduate education, at the City College in New York, was made possible only by the existence of that excellent free institution and the financial sacrifices of my parents.","My graduate study was interrupted, like that of many others, by World War II.","My assignment was exclusively in the research field, and my first published paper, On the Optimal Use of Winds for Flight Planning, was the outgrowth of that work.","My research, even before 1972, moved in directions beyond those cited for the Nobel Memorial Prize. Most of it, in one way or another, deals with information as an economic variable, both as to its production and as to its use.","In 1963 and later papers, I pointed out that the special market characteristics of medical care and medical insurance could be explained by reference to differences in information among the parties involved."],"Kenneth Kamler":["Every time I've been on Everest, people have died, though not in any expedition I was part of.","Even as a kid in the Bronx, I wanted an adventurous life.","The basic thing with adventure medicine or extreme medicine is that you are going to places where humans don't belong and people will certainly get into trouble.","When I went to Amazonia, l went as the field doctor for biologists studying crocodile behavior. There's no way humans should have any encounters with crocodiles. You should stay away from them!"],"Kenneth Kaunda":["Ambition never comes to an end.","It would have been disastrous for Zambia if we had gone multi-party because these parties would have been used by those opposed to Zambia's participation in the freedom struggle.","The inability of those in power to still the voices of their own consciences is the great force leading to change.","The power which establishes a state is violence; the power which maintains it is violence; the power which eventually overthrows it is violence.","My own child, one of them, died of AIDS. A brilliant boy.","I fight AIDS because it's a killer disease, destroys the human race in all fields.","I've been saying it all along: please do not demonise Robert Mugabe. I'm not saying the methods he's using are correct, but he was put under great pressure."],"Kenneth Koch":["Picasso said once when being interviewed that one should not be one's own connoisseur.","It's enormously cheering to get a good review by someone who seems to understand your work.","Certainly, it seems true enough that there's a good deal of irony in the world... I mean, if you live in a world full of politicians and advertising, there's obviously a lot of deception.","I was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. My family was not nationally known as being a literary family, though my mother and my mother's side of the family in general were interested in literature.","Some of the French surrealists at the beginning of the war had come over to New York and they brought out this magazine. It was a big, glossy magazine full of surrealist things.","I certainly have the feeling that I'm the same person even though I've changed a great deal.","As I look over my work, I mean every time I look over my early work, I see, yes, I could do that then and then I could do that and that... That may be the hardest thing for a writer, at least for a poet, to tell what the identity of his work is.","I've had trouble with criticism, I guess. It's hard to know what role criticism plays in either encouraging poets or in getting other people to read them.","Politics is there the way men and women are there, the way the Atlantic Ocean is there. Sometimes I've written about politics specifically, I mean about politics as it's understood on television and in newspapers.","As for political poetry, as it's usually defined, it seems there's very little good political poetry.","I love painting and music, of course. I don't know nearly as much about them as I know about poetry. I've certainly been influenced by fiction. I was overwhelmed by War and Peace when I read it, and I didn't read it until I was in my late 20s.","Maybe there are three or four really good poets in a generation.","I got married, other people went off. We had sort of another public-we were our entire readership for many years, and we were very excited by each other.","I was excited by what my painter friends were doing, and they seemed to be interested in our poetry too, and that was a wonderful little, fizzy sort of world.","I never thought of myself as a New York poet or as an American poet.","It seems everything is so full of possibilities one can hardly take it all in.","I wonder if I ever thought of an ideal reader... I guess when I was in my 20s and in New York and maybe even in my early 30s, I would write for my wife Janice... mainly for my poet friends and my wife, who was very smart about poetry.","I was influenced by surrealist poetry and painting as were thousands of other people, and it seems to me to have become a part of the way I write, but it's not.","Once I start writing about something, it goes off rather fast, and sometimes details which might be interesting such as what the room looked like or what somebody said that was not exactly on the same subject tend to get lost.","The subject matter of the stories on the surface... there seem to be a number of stories about travel.","When you finish a poem, it clicks shut like the top of a jewel box, but prose is endless. I haven't experienced an awful lot of clicking shut!","It's a well known thing that ordinary perceptions can have a strange aspect when one is travelling.","I'm a writer who likes to be influenced.","It takes a long time to publish a book."],"Kenneth L. Pike":["With acknowledgement of residues, we can be more easily prepared to grant the unit of science, the overlapping of disciplines, and the total coherence of all facts.","Identity in the form of continuity of personality is an extremely important characteristic of the individual.","Today's practicality is often no more than the accepted form of yesterday's theory.","Language is a tool adequate to provide any degree of precision relevant to a particular situation.","The universe extends beyond the mind of man, and is more complex than the small sample one can study.","If I were to adopt pure mechanism as a philosophy, there would be no way I could choose to be a scholar.","Normal social behavior requires that we be able to recognize identities in spite of change. Unless we can do so, there can be no human society as we know it.","The marvelous thing is that even in studying linguistics, we find that the universe as a whole is patterned, ordered, and to some degree intelligible to us.","Language is not merely a set of unrelated sounds, clauses, rules, and meanings; it is a total coherent system of these integrating with each other, and with behavior, context, universe of discourse, and observer perspective.","Acceptance of the power of God in one's life lays the groundwork for personal commitment to both science and Christianity, which so often have been in conflict.","That a society controls, to a greater or lesser extent, the behavior of its members is a universal; but the methods, the particulars of that control, vary from one culture to another.","It is also, I would guess, a universal that in all societies people value respectability granted to them.","We assume, to begin with, that the individual is at least as complex in his internal structure as the language is which he speaks - otherwise, how could he speak a language which is complex?","God cannot be reduced to a sample for analysis.","The price that one pays for refusing to act on the truth as one sees it, is to be led to believe untruth to avoid guilt.","If the scholar feels that he must know everything about any topic, he is in trouble - and will not publish with a clear conscience.","There is no truth without responsibility following in its wake.","The detached observer's view is one window on the world.","The view of the local scene through the eyes of a native participant in that scene is a different window.","Christianity stands or falls as a living program, a way of life, made concrete in the life of man by the life of God through the life of the concretely living Christ.","I wanted a theory that would allow one to live outside the office with the same philosophy one uses inside it.","This required the development of a view which allowed one to integrate research with belief, thing with person, fact with aesthetics, knowledge with application of knowledge.","Revelation and the nature of truth must be viewed in reference to the structure of language.","Fruitful discourse in science or theology requires us to believe that within the contexts of normal discourse there are some true statements.","Verbal and nonverbal activity is a unified whole, and theory and methodology should be organized or created to treat it as such.","Outward failure may be a manifested variant of inward success.","Courage to continue comes from deeper sources than outward results.","If language did not affect behavior, it could have no meaning.","Without a possibility of change in meanings human communication could not perform its present functions.","So I see that Christianity in believing in a Creator pulls together more facts, data, inner experience and ability than any mechanistic view could hold for me.","When I conform to truth, I do not conform to an abstract principle; I conform to the nature of God.","Nobody is as good as he thinks he is."],"Kenneth Langone":["A lawsuit with no legal precedent, seeking no damages, from no jury, in the name of stopping something that isn't happening?

That's another way of wanting to connect with people. It's not an aspect of human behavior that we generally consider to be very admirable, but it is, in some way, a means of connecting with someone else and not being alone.","Many movies about people recovering, moving on, and redeeming themselves are really wonderful and inspiring. But I think the more sentimental ones that are less good make me feel isolated - like, if you can't pull yourself up by your bootstraps like the guys in the movies, there is something wrong with you. That's a shame.","Teenagers all think their life is a movie. If you break up with someone or you have a fight, you walk around with movie scores playing in your head. You sort of see yourself suffering as you're suffering. There's a lot of melodrama attached to the real events of your life.","Little kids grow up discovering the world that's shown to them and then when you become a teenager, it kind of shrinks a little bit. I think when you get past that point, one of the important things is that you see there is more to the world than yourself.","I remember the kind of teenager I was, the kind of teenager I wanted to be, and then the kind of teenagers that were all around me. Life is lived on such a big scale in those years - and such an embarrassing one as well.","I personally don't need to see a story about a person that starts up miserable and ends up worse.","I'm always struck when I go somewhere I've never been before, especially if it's in my home town, by just how different the atmosphere can be, and how disorienting it can be - especially if there's any kind of trouble.","I was nearly a teen-ager before I stopped assuming that everyone I met was Jewish.","I feel like if you can describe something fully and accurately, then people will be able to see it themselves - they don't need be told what to.","I still haven't quite caught on to the idea of writing without dialogue. I like writing dialogue, and there's nothing wrong with dialogue in movies.","I wrote a play once called 'Lobby Hero,' which I thought turned out very well, but there's no final version of it. I published the one we produced, but there are seven other versions with different variations sitting in my desk at home.","I grew up going to the movies, not watching them on television, so I'm still a bit resistant to TV as a medium.","There's something about the impact of a big screen that means something to me, even though I realize almost every film is fated to be seen for a year in theaters, and then forever after on television.","It's not a character flaw to become an adult.","I've just always been interested in alter-naturalism and seeing if you can make real life interesting enough to be dramatic without enhancing it. Like, could you make a movie or write a play in which there's no compression of time, there's no enhanced event, it's just real life?","I love accents, I love listening to people talk, I like to try to emulate it as accurately as I can.","I think I have never seen a humorless movie that was any good to me.","I love 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind.'","I've done a lot of assignment work in my life, and the only way you can do it is to make it your own as quickly as possible, and then you give it back.","I know there are some actors who won't switch their accents off when they're on set and like to be called by their character's names. That works for them, and that's great.","Very often what will happen between actors is that they'll develop kind of a ghost relationship in real life that reflects their relationship on screen or in the play that they're doing. In fact, I'd say that happens almost every time. I don't know why that happens, but it seems very common.","There are a lot of elements when you're writing, or when I'm writing, that are sitting in the back of your mind. I try to let them stay there, because they find their way in more naturally that way.","If you're going to make a statement, I think you should write it in prose and make a statement. If you have characters who are mouthpieces for a point of view, then you have to be very clever about disguising it.","Sometimes films have no rehearsals - you don't have real rehearsals on the set because the day is so dominated by the schedule.","You're thinking about the physical consequences about what you're writing if you're going to direct it. If you're not going to direct it, then it's somebody else's problem, and they'll solve it.","The creative process on 'Margaret' was incredibly satisfying. I loved the cast; I had a great time writing the script. I liked making the movie. Believe it or not, I actually like editing the movie. It was all the rest of it that was such a nightmare.","When I walk onto a film set, I become frightened and nervous. There's all this equipment, all these people, and most of them do things you don't know how to do. I didn't come from a film background.","There's a lot of pressure on a film set that's more immediate than the pressure in the theater where you're nervous about what's going to happen next week.","You can shoot a film in New York without seeing the Empire State Building. Or Starbucks... although the latter is much less realistic.","I often find myself writing about people taking care of each other, or trying to.","I actually think storyboards are great. I don't draw well enough to do them myself. I've only used storyboards a couple of times. We used two storyboards in 'Margaret': one for the bus accident and for the opera sequence at the end.","There are so many details in a movie that it's amazing how much work you'll do to change what adds up to not that much material.","I do a lot of improvising when I'm writing, and I work very hard on the scripts... they are written very much in an actor-friendly way.","Actors are very demanding because they have nowhere to hide. If I write a scene, it doesn't turn out very well, I don't ever have to show it to anyone; when you turn the camera on, or when you walk on stage, they have to feel like what's happening is real.","To me, 'director's cut' means that what was released before was somebody else's cut. That, to me, always implies that what was released wasn't what the director wanted.","'You Can Count On Me' took 20 days to shoot, and we had 50 days to shoot 'Margaret.'","The theater is often seen as comical in the movies; to me, it's not comical - it's my life. I don't mean that it can't be comical, but it's not only comical.","You discover two things when you're a teenager. One, that your parents are not the idols that you thought they were when you were growing up, if you had nice parents. And two, that you have power over them, and you can upset them and confront them and attack them.","I can remember when I was 24, and I broke up with my first serious girlfriend for the first time. She was a very nice person, but she had a little bit of a tendency toward melodrama... Her response was to take the key to my apartment off of her key chain and hand it back to me.","I remember yelling at my mother one time, horribly. I was in tenth grade or something like that, and I hadn't done something, and she misunderstood because my stepfather told her something that was wrong that I hadn't done.","My personal pride is not strong enough to make me brave. But I don't know why I equate being brave with fighting.","I think 'Manchester' is really about grieving and trying to get on after something terrible has happened to an adult, and a whole life being destroyed, and then, what are the forces that keep him involved with the people he loves? They love him, and they won't let him go.","The really funny comedies to me are always the ones that are played the straightest or given the most emotional content. And when people start making faces and setting things up and commenting and winking at you, I don't find that to be very funny.","A really good comedy, I think, is played as if it was real, and it's the circumstances that make it amusing. And I think that the - the inverse or the reverse is true for drama.","There are some situations in life that are simply not funny, and there's nothing funny about them, but they're rare, and they don't last all that long.","Truthfully, and I don't mean to sound naive, but I don't know that much about the film business.","'Margaret' as a creative entity is something that I'm very happy and proud of. But 'Margaret' as a professional experience was a nightmare until it was rescued by critics and people who liked it.","I'm always really interested in different environments and how they affect people's lives and what it would be like to live somewhere else."],"Kenneth More":["In an upside down world, with all the rules being rewritten as the game goes on and spectators invading the pitch, it is good to feel that some things and some people seem to stay just as they were.","I am the reassurance that they have not changed. In an upside down world, with all the rules being rewritten as the game goes on and spectators invading the pitch, it is good to feel that some things and some people seem to stay just as they were.","Oh, Mr Coward, sir - I could never have an affair with you, because you remind me of my father!","A film like Genevieve to my contemporaries is not a film made years ago, but last week or last year. They see me as I was then, not as I am now.","Bader's philosophy was my philosophy. His whole attitude to life was mine.","Most parts that can be played by one actor can equally well be played by another, but not this."],"Kenneth Noland":["Context begins with other artists - seniors and mentors.","I think of painting without subject matter as music without words.","For me context is the key - from that comes the understanding of everything.","The scene then as now was centered in New York. For the most part, I've kept a bit apart from that attractive and seductive city. I've done it by living in the country within commuting distance.","Usually I throw away what I don't get right the first time.","As time goes on, I realize more and more that, beginning in the early 30's, David Smith began setting the precedent for what was to come later for many of us.","Because of this the representation I'm interested in is of those things only the eye can touch.","Clem had made it known that Pollock was a great painter.","I met David Smith through my former wife, Cornelia, who'd studied with him.","I've also been willing to share any help that I could give to any other artist.","In the '50s Morris Louis and I were not known, David Smith and Helen Frankenthaler were not much known.","Pollock was well known, certainly, but for all the wrong reasons. He was known as much for being wild and unconventional in his working methods as for being a great artist.","With artists of my own generation there was at first no group identity - and never a clique."],"Kenneth Oppel":["Flying into a storm, even its outer edges, did not seem like a good idea to me. And this was no ordinary tempest. Everyone on the bridge knew what it was: the Devil's Fist, a near-eternal typhoon that migrated about the North Indian basin year-round. She was infamous, and earned her name by striking airships out of the sky.","Realistically, the chance of any book becoming a film is slim.","I'm cursed with this puritanical streak that makes me want everything to be about something. It's a terrible affliction.","The more I worked on 'Half Brother,' the more it seemed to me the story was really about love in all its possible forms - how and why we decide to bestow it, or withdraw it; how we decide what is more worthy of being loved, and what is less. We are masters of conditional love.","I wrote 'Airborn' after completing three books about bats. I loved my bats, but what a treat it was to write about humans again. They could eat food other than midges and mosquitoes, they wore clothing, they slept in beds - all this struck me as wonderfully novel.","One of the reasons I wrote 'Airborn' was that I'd fallen in love with the great passenger airships which flew in the '20s and '30s. Their time was short-lived. They were frail, they tended to crash; and they could never be as fast, safe and efficient as the airplanes that replaced them.","I think good art should always be entertaining, or at least give pleasure of some sort. And my chief goal as a writer has always been to tell a good story and give my readers a good time.","The seed for my novel 'Half Brother' was planted in my mind over twenty years ago, but didn't germinate until late 2007 when I came across the obituary for Washoe, an extraordinary chimpanzee who had learned over 250 words of American Sign Language.","When I'd written my 'Silverwing' series - I'd imbued the bats with full human awareness and vocabulary.","We used to flock to watch gladiators, public torture and executions. In more recent times, our appetite for mortal violence has been sublimated in sports, photorealistic video games, film and literature.","It's somewhat disquieting that the same parents and educators who are horrified by the notion of child soldiers have bestowed upon 'The Hunger Games' a double mantle of critical praise and global bestsellerdom.","The world of 'The Hunger Games' is a paranoid survivalist's dream."],"Kenneth R. Miller":["Evolution isn't just a story about where we came from. It's an epic at the center of life itself. Far from robbing our lives of meaning, it instills an appreciation for the beautiful, enduring, and ultimately triumphant fabric of life that covers our planet. Understanding that doesn't demean human life - it enhances it.","Our own genomes carry the story of evolution, written in DNA, the language of molecular genetics, and the narrative is unmistakable.","I am always struck by the fact that human awareness of our place in nature, like so much of modern science, began with the Industrial Revolution.","What evolution tells us is that we are part of a grand, dynamic, and ever-changing fabric of life that covers our planet. Even to a person of faith, in fact especially to a person of faith, an understanding of the evolutionary process should only deepen their appreciation of the scope and wisdom of the creator's work.","Once upon a time, growing up male gave little boys a sense of certainty about the natural order of things. We had short hair, wore pants, and played baseball. Girls had long hair, wore skirts, and, no matter how hard they tried, always threw a baseball just like a girl.","Biology is far from understanding exactly how a single cell develops into a baby, but research suggests that human development can ultimately be explained in terms of biochemistry and molecular biology. Most scientists would make a similar statement about evolution.","As you know, the fossil record includes not only the ancestors of crocodiles and whales, but also the ancestors of human beings. And this, of course, is why evolution remains controversial.","There is no controversy within science over the core proposition of evolutionary theory.","The scientific argument advanced for intelligent design at the Dover trial, those arguments collapsed, scientifically and intellectually.","From Roger Bacon, the 13th century Franciscan who pioneered the scientific method, to George Lemaitre, the 20th century Belgian priest who first developed a mathematical foundation for the 'Big Bang,' people of faith have played a key role in advancing scientific understanding.","All too often, the word 'religion' has become identified with those promoting a frankly anti-scientific view of nature and of our place in the natural world.","We don't regard any scientific theory as the absolute truth.","The argument for intelligent design basically depends on saying, 'You haven't answered every question with evolution,'... Well, guess what? Science can't answer every question.","The new strategy is to teach intelligent design without calling it intelligent design.","Being a Christian, I'm eager to introduce people to Jesus. I just don't think I should do it in the science classroom.","We believe the ice sheet was not around all the time. It was only around during cool snaps of the climate.","Any suggestion that science and religion are incompatible flies in the face of history, logic, and common sense.","Modern science developed in the context of western religious thought, was nurtured in universities first established for religious reasons, and owes some of its greatest discoveries and advances to scientists who themselves were deeply religious.","America's got a Darwin problem - and it matters. According to a 2009 Gallup poll taken on the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin's birth, fewer than 40% of Americans are willing to say that they 'believe in evolution.'","In an age of molecular genomics, it is ever more apparent that the fingerprints of evolution are pressed deeply into human DNA, just as they are into the genomes of every other organism. Biologists understand this, and so do students who study the science of life.","Whether conservative or liberal, fundamentalist or agnostic, the more students learn of biology, the more they accept evolution.","Like many other scientists who hold the Catholic faith, I see the Creator's plan and purpose fulfilled in our universe. I see a planet bursting with evolutionary possibilities, a continuing creation in which the Divine providence is manifest in every living thing. I see a science that tells us there is indeed a design to life.","For much of history it was possible to believe that the great diversity of life on Earth was a fixed creation, that the living world had never changed. But when the first stirrings of industry demanded that fuel be dug from the earth and hillsides be leveled for roads and railways, the Earth's true past was dug up in abundance.","We humans have a tendency to see ourselves as completely different from other animals, and the way in which large segments of the public continue to reject the theory of evolution is just one symptom of that malaise.","Evolution isn't just a take-it-or-leave-it story about where we came from. It's an epic at the centre of life itself. It tells us we are part of nature in every respect.","'Intelligent Design,' the relabeled, repackaged form of American creationism, has always had a problem. It just can't seem to produce any evidence.","Although each egg cell produced by a woman carries a single X chromosome, the sperm cells produced by a man carry either an X or a Y. This means, in very simple terms, that the sperm cell determines a baby's sex."],"Kenneth Rexroth":["Man thrives where angels would die of ecstasy and where pigs would die of disgust.","This isn't the best town for what we're doing.

She saw the Life write up on Buddhism, with pictures of the ceremony, and she said she wanted to be confirmed there because she only liked Jesus as a kid. She was a little disappointed in him when he grew up.","You don't become a saint until you lead a good life whether in Tibet or Italy or America."],"Kenneth Scott Latourette":["Freedom was conditioned by man's physical body, heredity, and environment.","Compared with the thousands of years in which human life has been on this planet, Christianity is a recent development.","The primary source of the appeal of Christianity was Jesus - His incarnation, His life, His crucifixion, and His resurrection.","The history of Christianity, therefore, must be of concern to all who are interested in the record of man and particularly to all who seek to understand the contemporary human scene.","Hinduism's basic tenet is that many roads exist by which men have pursued and still pursue their quest for the truth and that none has universal validity.","Christianity is usually called a religion. As a religion it has had a wider geographic spread and is more deeply rooted among more peoples than any other religion in the history of mankind.","In both the presence of evil and the eventual triumph over evil the sweep is cosmic. It embraces the entire universe, what to man is both seen and unseen. The victory is to be accomplished through Christ.","Christians were regarded as separated from society and therefore destructive of the Greco-Roman way of life.","This means that to man God gave a degree of free will.","That free will was demonstrated in the placing of temptation before man with the command not to eat of the fruit of the tree which would give him a knowledge of good and evil, with the disturbing moral conflict to which that awareness would give rise.","When contrasted with the much longer time that life has been present, the course of Christianity thus far is but a brief moment.","We must, however, note that what are usually called the high religions made their appearance within about twenty-five hundred years - most of them within fifteen hundred years.","The most that one of Jewish faith can do - and some have gladly done it - is to say that Jesus was the greatest in the long succession of Jewish prophets. None can acknowledge that Jesus was the Messiah without becoming a Christian.","In contrast, Christianity, while acknowledging the presence of suffering, declares that life can be infinitely worth living and opens the way to eternal life in fellowship with God Who so loved the world that He gave Himself in Christ.","Christianity emerged from the religion of Israel. Or rather, it has as its background a persistent strain in that religion. To that strain Christians have looked back, and rightly, as the preparation in history for their faith.","The prophets and the writers of the Psalms were clear that God was continuing to work in the universe and in all history. They declared that He had created the universe.","The Psalms, the anthology of the hymns of Israel, are still used by Christians.","Religiously the Empire was pluralistic and marked by a search for a faith which would be satisfying intellectually and ethically and would give assurance of immortality.","Although when Christianity appeared the total population of the planet was only a fraction of that of the twentieth century, most of the earth's surface was quite outside the Mediterranean world, Persia, India, and China.","John the Baptist, who we are told was related by blood to Jesus, was preaching the impending judgement of God, urging repentance and moral reform, and baptizing in the Jordan River those who responded.","We know something of the history of the spread of Christianity, but much passed from recorded memory and much was transmitted by tradition whose accuracy has been repeatedly questioned.","In the third century after Christ the faith continued to spread."],"Kenneth Tynan":["A neurosis is a secret that you don't know you are keeping.","Art is a private thing, the artist makes it for himself; a comprehensible work is the product of a journalist. We need works that are strong, straight, precise, and forever beyond understanding.","A critic is a man who knows the way but can't drive the car.","What, when drunk, one sees in other women, one sees in Garbo sober.","Pearl is a disease of oysters. Levant is a disease of Hollywood.","Not content to have the audience in the palm of his hand, he goes one further and clinches his fist.","The sheer complexity of writing a play always had dazzled me. In an effort to understand it, I became a critic.","A good drama critic is one who perceives what is happening in the theatre of his time. A great drama critic also perceives what is not happening.","A city whose living immediacy is so urgent that when I am in it I lose all sense of the past.","A novel is a static thing that one moves through; a play is a dynamic thing that moves past one."],"Kenneth Williams":["I see myself as a roving mosquito, choosing it's target.","We know grooming is important for people. To get their hair done, to get makeup and things like that - that makes a person feel better.","A fan club is a group of people who tell an actor he's not alone in the way he feels about himself.","The nice thing about quotes is that they give us a nodding acquaintance with the originator which is often socially impressive.","It was Noel Coward whose technique I envied and tried to emulate. I collected all his records and writing.","I found that if I got up on the stage to entertain the troops I could make them shut up and look.","People need to be peppered or even outraged occasionally. Our national comedy and drama is packed with earthy familiarity and honest vulgarity. Clean vulgarity can be very shocking and that, in my view, gives greater involvement."],"Kenny Baker":["I had a day off, and I was walking down the street one day, and this Mercedes pulls up alongside me, and Alec Guinness leaned out and said, 'What are you doing, Kenny?' I said, 'I'm just walking around,' and he said, 'Do you want to come and see an oasis with my wife and I?' There was nothing arrogant or flash about him at all.","They don't always use dwarfs, unfortunately. They shouldn't be allowed to do that! How dare they do 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' and not have dwarfs!","I started performing in 1950 at the age of 16 when I joined the Burton Lester's Midgets as a performer. Shortly after, I became a DJ with Mecca Organization before joining Billy Smart's Circus as a clown and shadow Ringmaster.","I've been in show business for 50, no, 60 years. I was approached in school to join a variety act.","I skated in ice shows all over Europe and South Africa for 20 years. I love to ice skate.","I started out Ice skating with 'Holiday On Ice' and just got offered the part of R2 by chance.","I'm the smallest man in show business, and I've got the smallest bird in Britain nesting in my garden.","Everything in my house has had to be specially adapted, from the height of the bed to the positioning of doorknobs. Even my Rolls Royce had special stacked pedals and an extra-low steering wheel.","I used to tour the theatres and clubs with an 18-foot luxury caravan strapped to the back of my Roller - it was a damn site more comfortable than most hotels.","I miss being able to play my instruments - I'm too much of a physical wreck these days. Playing the vibraphone gives me backache, leg ache, and everything-else ache, and the asthma means I no longer have enough puff to play harmonica.","Everything went wrong for me in the 1990s.","There are not very many opportunities for little people in the industry. There are small parts and character parts, but we don't get the girl-at-the-end-of-the-film kind of parts... but I was quite happy with what I was doing.","I didn't really get involved too heavily with being an actual film person.","I've always been a cabaret-vaudeville artist - an hourlong cabaret and a floor show in a hotel - somebody like that. That's my main forte.","I get about three letters a day from all over the world.","I do enjoy doing pantomime at Christmas. If I didn't do it, I'd feel as though I was missing something.","When TV came in, it closed a lot of theatres. Even the 'ice' shows melted away.","There just aren't many little guys who are good actors. They don't get the training; they don't go to RADA. There just aren't the parts for dwarfs, and if you like it or not, you're typecast as a dwarf."],"Kenny Chesney":["Football taught me how hard you had to work to achieve something.","My mind is constantly going. For me to completely relax, I gotta get rid of my cell phone.","Me and my band and crew have always lived by the code: 'Work hard, play harder.'","I'm like a shark. I've got to be constantly moving.","It sounds like a cliche, but it... you do sing about what you know about. And I grew up in a small town, and I grew up in a place where your whole world revolved around friends, family, school, and church, and sports.","I don't think I ever feel sexy. I don't think that's for me to decide, if I'm sexy or not.","Music's supposed to come from the heart. I felt like that if it ever got mechanical, I was going to back away from it.","First and foremost, I consider myself a songwriter.","Social topics may hit too close to home for people, but then again, if you pull a heartstring, then that's what country music is. It's not just songs about getting drunk and leaving your girl.","The last couple of years I've been on an empty tank. And that's gotta change.","My career was really odd, because I literally had a greatest hits album out and nobody knew who I was. They knew the songs, but they didn't know me.","It was satisfying to take a risk and see it pay off.","I realized that I wanted to get better in every way. As a person, as a friend, as a songwriter, as a musician, as an artist, record producer, you name it.","I had a notepad and I wrote down 30 things to make myself better just off the top of my head, and the next day I started to do that.","I like to rock and roll, but I'm a mushy guy, too. I want to be the guy that all the girls love and all the guys want to hang out with.","I have 120 employees on the road every day, and about 30 other employees off the road.","I want there to be a level of respect between everybody.","There's this idea that somebody's job could be more important than somebody else's, and to me, that's not true.","I'm so hands-on, from the color of my tour bus to what I eat for dinner at 5 or the way the lights are hung.","It's very hard for me to relax.","I work hard but I play hard.","My fans reflect who I am.","I love the fact that I can go out there on stage with a guitar and sing a song that means something to somebody.","I do sell fun.","I'll admit I'm a workaholic.","In all the years that I've been doing this, I've never launched a tour and launched an album at basically the same time. Doing one of those things is enough!","I grew up in east Tennessee, and everybody knew everybody's business.","It's not just in my industry... everything is so sensationalized that there's not a lot of heart and soul in a lot of things there used to be heart and soul in.","I've gotten to meet so many people who've inspired me as a human being.","You'd think I'd have been happiest in my life playing music in front of 50,000 people at Gillette Stadium. But let me tell you, it's an odd feeling to feel alone in the spotlight.","I was standing onstage last year, and I felt like I wanted to be somewhere else. No matter how many people were out there, it all just felt like a blank sheet of paper.","When I was playing for tips in college, I felt a fire in my soul. I had the same principle of focus that I had learned playing football.","Before, I was more concerned with getting on the radio, like many young artists.","I needed to be pushed as an artist and as a person.","Over the years I've had people tell me that they come to my show to escape.","I think that in the last four or five years I've constantly struggled with the balance in my life.","Things that made me happy five, six years ago don't make me happy anymore.","I want to spend more time with my family.","I've always been drawn to the ocean.","I think there is a part of life that I'm missing.","I can say that I don't see myself with the foot on the gas pedal as hard as it's been down for 16 years.","I need to recharge creatively, and get off the clock of having to be somewhere just because, and having to keep juggling all these things.","This is a bit of curveball, but people who are really good kissers never have anything given to them.","People who can't kiss had everything given to them.","I guess what I'm trying to say is, I'm a helluva kisser.","So many nights I'm up there on stage and I wish everybody out in the audience could see what I see and feel what I feel.","I'm running a radio station.","I would like to be married and have kids. I would like to do that... Yes, I could see me settling down at some point.","There are only so many hours you can sit on the bus and watch TV or play basketball or whatever we do to pass the time before we go out onstage.","I'm a huge Aerosmith fan.","I remember making up songs in my head.","I'm pretty firm in my sexuality and my love for women.","Believe it or not, I want to keep growing my audience.","I can't believe that I get to stand on the stages I stand on every summer, and get to sing the songs that I sing."],"Kenny Cunningham":["It will be difficult to let go but it is going to happen sooner rather than later in my case.","I wouldn't even mention myself in the same breath as someone like big Paul.","He was a fantastic player, but the thing that impressed me most about Paul was his manner off the pitch. He was always very humble about his achievements and had a lot of time for the paying public and people in general.","Looking back I find it hard to believe that I could forge a career in anything other than football but I didn't do too badly in my final exams and there were a few business-related courses that interested me.","I am hugely proud to have played for Ireland.","I never felt I would get to the stage where I would to have to actively think about retiring from international football as I always thought it would pass me by.","I never felt I would be part of the international scene for 50 caps in my wildest dreams.","I definitely want to be involved but only while I think I can make a contribution and I make a difference.","I enjoyed seven years at Wimbledon and there were high and low points.","I became more confident within myself and matured as a person and become a little bit more opinionated - maybe the lads might say a little bit too opinionated for their liking but that is just a natural progression for a player."],"Kenny Dalglish":["Paul Lambert has assembled a great bunch of lads and training has been going very well. I am just desperate to get into the team and do my best for the club.","I am absolutely delighted to get back into football with Livingston.","What is called for is dignity. We need to set an example.","I was putting myself under enormous pressure to be successful.","I had to know if I could make it somewhere else. I did not want to go through the rest of my life wondering what might have been without putting myself to the test.","The scoreline is a bit flattering really.","It has been an honor and a privilege to have had the chance to come back to Liverpool Football Club as manager.","We have got a problem winning games in the league. We have to educate ourselves and maybe we have to not play the lovely football that we have been."],"Kenny G":["I've learned that you simply can't control those bad vibes.","I started realizing that music is the one area where I've always let go. When that saxophone goes into my mouth, I get into a space where I never think about the notes I've already played or anticipate the notes ahead.","Any saxophone player will have those influences come through in their music in a very different way. I can listen to the same 10 sax players as someone else for my entire life, and we'll both play completely differently. That's the beauty of being a musician.","What is music anyway? It's a form of communication, and that's why I play the kind of music that I think - that I hope - can communicate with people.","I really create everything I do from the heart.","I've never really played golf. With the sax, I learned technique well enough so that it feels like part of my body, and I just express myself. That's where I want to get in golf.","I'm responsive to my public, but I also follow my heart.","I listen to all the top 20 songs, and top 20 albums, even the rap albums. But I don't like negative messages. If somebody is putting a lot of ego out there, I don't like it. When I make my records I want it to be sincere.","I live my life and play my music, and I don't really seek out other people's approval or accolades or things like that. I try to do what's true to me, and how it all comes out is fine.","I listen to old jazz and classical music, and that's it.","If you go to Tiananmen Square, or go to any public area in China, you will hear my music at some point.","Generally, I like Indian music because the melodies are usually not too complex, which is how I like music, and that's the way I write music.","That's my ideal day, time with my boys.","I mean, what is music anyway? It's a form of communication - at least for me it is. And that's why I play the kind of music that I think - that I hope - can communicate with people.","It wasn't until Duotones that I felt my true voice come out.","Being a purely instrumental album, it makes a musical statement, not a religious one, and I hope that people can feel the emotion of the great melodies, even without the words.","The Moment is an album that contains the best music I have ever produced.","I've never personally criticized anyone else's music, but I know that the public's real problem is not the music I make but the perception that I play simple music for money only and for the notoriety and to increase my popularity.","Just because people play songs with great technique doesn't mean the records are better.","I learned so much about playing and touring being on the road and in the studio with Jeff, but I'd always played a lot of gigs in Seattle even prior to joining the Fusion.","Finally, I was no longer a student and was making music for myself.","The whole rise of new adult contemporary music and smooth jazz was a nice surprise.","I approach everything in my life the same way; if it feels right, I know it.","When I play live, I feel how the audience is going and follow and lead at the same time.","I don't play the traditional Charlie Parker songs. But I do improvise and I do create with my instrument, and that to me is jazz. But there are people who use the word 'jazz' only in a traditional sense, and they would be offended by that, and that's fine.","I think everybody has to kind of decide what the word 'jazz' means to them, and that's fine.","Just figure out what you think jazz is, and then if it fits into that category, it's jazz, and if it doesn't, it isn't. It's no big deal.","I'm just more into playing golf. It's a great thing.","If I even lose my glasses or make a mistake. I become really disappointed in myself.","Maybe I'm a dreamer, but I think the ordinary guy has just as much right to say 'This is a good song' as somebody who is in the music business.","You can't just walk away when somebody recognizes you. You have to take some time out and talk to them. It's not a waste of time - I just love talking to people. And I don't do this to sell records. The truth is, I do what I do because I love it.","Maybe the biggest thing that I've learned musically is that anything is possible. Things can work when maybe they don't seem like they can.","There are a few countries that, for whatever reason, really enjoy listening to my music.","Well, Grover Washington was my main influence and when I went to college, I started listening to more of the jazz masters like Sonny Rollins, Cannonball Adderley, and John Coltrane.","I just started as a part of the public school music program. I took lessons at the school every Friday and was a part of the school band. I was just a normal kid taking instrumental lessons at school, nothing special.","Grover Washington was my main influence, and when I went to college, I started listening to more of the jazz masters like Sonny Rollins, Cannonball Adderley, and John Coltrane.","Unless I've got Katy Perry on the cover of my CD, it's going to be tough to sell a lot of records.","I don't go to clubs. I don't know what club mixes are supposed to sound like.","I've been performing since I was in high school, so I've seen people react to my music and my playing. I'm always appreciative when people like the music, but I'm not shocked.","With the sax, I learned technique well enough so that it feels like part of my body, and I just express myself. That's where I want to get in golf.","Sure, I love people, and I want to communicate with people. I mean, what is music anyway? It's a form of communication - at least for me it is. And that's why I play the kind of music that I think - that I hope - can communicate with people.","I was really amazed when I started hearing 'Songbird' on the radio. I couldn't believe that the record company promotion department had actually convinced radio music directors to play it -because there wasn't anything like it on the radio at the time.","I'm very serious about what I do. I practice every day for three hours. I work on my scales; I work on my tone. But otherwise, I like to have fun."],"Kenny Guinn":["Gaming is the backbone of Nevada's economy.","I believe the best service to the child is the service closest to the child, and children who are victims of neglect, abuse, or abandonment must not also be victims of bureaucracy. They deserve our devoted attention, not our divided attention.","There is something permanent, and something extremely profound, in owning a home.","Make no mistake about it: Next to parents and families, our teachers are the most important influence in our children's lives.","As I said in my state of the state address, we can no longer rely on gaming and sales taxes to pay our way. Indian gaming next door in California is eroding our major industry in Nevada.","Education isn't part of my agenda, it is my agenda.","Nevada once again has shown double digit increases in tax revenue... Nevada continues to show economic stability with its desirable business climate and booming tourism sector."],"Kenny Hickey":["Yeah, I kinda still get nervous sometimes now.","We've always had a dark atmosphere to our performances, so it sort of developed along those ways.","We are all atheists.","It wasn't so much of a controlled effort to end up as part of the Goth scene.","I'm a recovering alcoholic so I should be home.","I think it's just a lack of ability, we're incapable of writing hits.","I look at is as one single entity. I dehumanize the audience. This way, I don't get nervous, you know?","I hate crowds of people pretending to be happy on one night of the year, where they get drunk and obnoxious by the end of the night.","Everything is a battle with this band.","Aww, come on man, I can barely handle 6 strings.","Also there's two sides of it, I mean, a band like us, at our level and the way we have to promote ourselves and usually radio just completely turns their back on us, at the same time I think Mp3s help promote us somewhat, spreading the word about the album and stuff."],"Kenny Johnson":["I love people! I am a people person. I am a very curious human being. I am very interested in what people have to say. I love cultures, too, so I am always traveling.","In my work, I just want to tell a story and help people go on a journey. I'm glad any fans that I do have, and I'm usually not aware of it until I get out there or read a message board. I want to thank everyone who follows my work.","I know real cops. When they're paired up together, they get so close, you know? There's no excuse for it, but these guys do have a connection. They fight like cats and dogs, but when they get in a really messed-up situation, they're there for each other."],"Kenny Leon":["Great theater continues to bind us, one to the other, and most of us will travel far and wide to see a good story told well.","I was a political science major. I was always interested in social impact.","I came from the South with a mother who was hard working, so I love going to work every day.","As an older generation, we need to give all our young people love and the possibility of realizing their dreams. For instance, if I get really political, the fact that some people can't go to college, can't even think about college, that's not American; that's not right.","A lot of times, we are trapped by our own false sense of security. You can do whatever it is you put your mind to. Your goal is to find your purpose.","To me, I'm sort of like Dorothy in 'The Wiz.' It kind of parallels my life. It's a story that reminds me... that home is where the love is. So if I go to Tampa or St. Pete, and I feel the love there, that's my home. That's where the love is.","When I'm acting, I'm just worried about that piece of the pie, contributing to the whole. But when you're directing, you... get the vision out of your head and on the stage.","In the early '90s, there was an attention to diversity. In this country, diversity was a good thing. People would use words like 'multicultural' and like it. Now, politically, those words are out. But I still feel theaters have to be diverse in order to survive.","The first 45 or 50 years of the regional theater movement, all these folks, they built these theaters. The job of the next generation is to maintain them.","I'm not one to spend my life asking the question, 'Is there racism in America?' Certainly there is. But I want to do something about it.","I always say film is art, theater is life and television is furniture.","I love the idea of live theater the best because you are sitting there with the community in the dark, looking at the light, and that's really - you can't get any higher than that.","When I'm working in television, I've learned you've got to work fast. You don't have time to rehearse; you don't have time to just mess around. You've got to move quickly. So I pick that up from that world, and I also pick up the idea of development of character and development of situations.","I love film because you have the last word. I never get that on stage because you've got to really believe; you've got to get the actors to trust you, and they have to believe in you, and then hopefully they will when you open the show.","President Obama became our first African American president, and for me, it is the stuff of which dreams are made.","I don't know how racists live with their racism. We need to take the road of love. I don't think folks are born that way; it's learned and taught out of fear.","Broadway is the same as Hollywood. Every few years we say we reached the mountaintop, then we take two steps back.","I like working with actors who make choices. Whether they get their ideas from me or from themselves, I want them to own all the choices so I can take my hand out of it.","As I tell young people in workshops, 'It's your country. If you came here on the bottom of a slave ship, if your people came here seeking political freedom - however your folks got here - it belongs to you just as much as it belongs to anyone, so claim it. It's your birthright. America belongs to every person who is here.'","I think 'Holler If Ya Hear Me' is almost 'A Raisin in the Sun' 50 years later, with just a different 20-year-old voice speaking the words. But it's about access to the American dream and equal lives having equal value in America. It's still holding a mirror up to us so we can see ourselves.","I've directed 'Raisin in the Sun' five times. You keep discovering things. You keep on seeing things in the script that you never saw before. That's what great pieces of art do.","I tried to stay off the stage, but you know, I'm an actor; I'm an artist.","As an artist, you're thankful to get a shot at a story more than once, because it doesn't happen all the time. Whether you talk about 'Hamlet' or 'Death of a Salesman,' you always want to see what the next group of actors will do.","I always approach every play based on the cast. When Denzel and I did 'Fences,' I didn't go to rehearsals and say, 'OK, James Earl Jones did a wonderful job in '87. Let me see if you can come close to James Earl Jones.'","I've always had an affinity for writers who have a poetry background, so I always liked Tennessee Williams.","Broadway, in my opinion, is a microcosm of America. Those challenges that we have in our country, I think we still have those challenges on the Broadway stage. I think there are far too few African-American directors working on Broadway.","I've always liked that idea of a diverse group of audience members sitting together, rubbing up against each other and taking on the life of a culture that doesn't belong to either one of them.","There's room for Spike Lee's movies; there's room for Tyler Perry's movies. There's room for classics with an all black cast. There's room for all of it as long as we don't try to make any one piece define us as a race.","I grew up a poor kid in Florida, and I was always in Florida living with my stepfather and my mother, and we used to, every year, sit down and watch 'The Wizard of Oz.' And I think to this day that's probably the foundation for everything I've done since."],"Kenny Loggins":["Running away will never make you free.","My trust in a higher power that wants me to survive and have love in my life, is what keeps me moving forward.","That's an old saying I just made up.","My quest these days is to find my long lost inner child, but I'm afraid if I do, I'll end up with food in my hair and way too in love with the cats.","The more honest you can be, the less you have to hide... when I have nothing to hide, I have everything to give.","There is trust in there being a Spirit who loves me and wants me to have love in my life. I trust in this higher power, it is what keeps me moving forward no matter what happens.","I couldn't have come up with a better metaphor for my life and my internal conflict. It amazes me how quickly we can manifest our fears; not only had I created my 'I'm never satisfied, I'll drive her away' nightmare.","I am attracting a new audience now, one that is more open and more spiritually inclined.","I must let go of my need for the world to love me.","We busted a lot of family secrets with this. But to make a long story short, my parents relationship was built heavily on security issues for my Mom, and when my Dad couldn't provide security, the relationship unraveled.","Relationships are so much a rerun of our parental relationships. We're rerunning the relationship they were in together and we're rerunning the relationship we had with them with our lover.","I had to get in touch with the source, I had to go back into my abandonment issues with my mother, I had to go into issues with my father I hadn't even looked at before.","It's been quite a 'pattern interrupt', a massive change of the old programming.","You must have love as the core; it takes courage to be willing to constantly tell the truth to each other and risk letting the relationship go.","I've worked so hard to eliminate the inner geek from my life. I suddenly realize I have no patience for those people who still have their geeks showing. Now I see why being 'normal' has been so important to me.","I am learning to forgive my inner geek, and even value him as a free man.","When I see that my geek may have contained some of the best parts of me, when I love and appreciate him, I set my children free to see themselves as lovable however they are.","Whatever I have not yet learned to tolerate in myself inevitably will appear in my children. In this way, they, like Julia, guide me to a new level of self-awareness and everyone benefits.","My rite of passage into my brave new world, life on the road.","I know that Julia has been given to me for my spiritual growth, and this moment is perfect for us both. I know that I love her, and I know she's my soul mate.","I couldn't be in a relationship and behave like somebody else or pretend I felt something I didn't feel. And that includes saying things I thought might jeopardize the relationship.","Real freedom is creative, proactive, and will take me into new territories. I am not free if my freedom is predicated on reacting to my past.","When we were first offered a book deal prior to Avon's, they were trying to get us to change it from the first-person story into a how-to book, and they were offering us some decent money. My agent told me; 'you should really consider this'.","I knew what book we had to write, it was clear in my head; it was journals and poetry. So I passed on their offer. I told my agent this is our vision, and no one's done it this way.","This is the front edge of the spiritual, psychological movement and is where the tools of psychology have finally come together to create a mass healing. I think spiritual psychology is the next wave.","Why not hold on to whatever I've got because it's as good as it's ever going to get. How can I believe that love is coming, how can I even believe that love exists; if I don't believe it's spiritually based?","I think Julia is defining a new feminism. It's the power of the open heart. And its ok to be sexual.","The corporate woman has been defined as the 'liberated woman' and I see that as the exact opposite. I think she now is more enslaved, maybe even more than the housewife was; because she's so out of her power, and imitating male power is not female power.","Women are just beginning to see that; there's something about being a woman that's innately different from being a man. I love what I'm seeing take place and I know Julia has so much to offer.","It's hard enough doing something bold without jumping into your bad reviews.","I am not as scared about people tearing this one up as I would have been in the past because of the basis in 'knowing' this one has. There are people out there that are hungry for this.","Courage is always rewarded."],"Kenny Marchant":["This country was founded on a core set of family values. These values should not be discouraged and blatantly undermined by the airing of offensive material on broadcast television and radio.","We must become more energy independent. The development of ANWR will assist in this goal.","Unfortunately a Constitutional amendment that would have empowered Congress to make desecration of the United States flag illegal failed to pass by one vote.","In today's global economy, however, it is important to raise the bar of excellence even higher. Today's students must be prepared to compete effectively on an international level.","This year, as we celebrate the 230th anniversary of America's independence, please remember the symbols that are sacred to this country. Fly Old Glory high and show your respect and admiration for this great nation and the values we hold dear.","Yet while on my trip to the Middle East, the London bombings occurred. This was yet another stark reminder that if we don't fight terrorists abroad, they just get closer to our home.","We are in a time when the Peace Corps mission is more vital than ever, and the organization is at a 30-year high in the number of volunteers in the field. The Peace Corps is currently in 69 posts and serving 75 countries across the globe.","We are fortunate to live an area that is blessed with outstanding schools and educators. We are proud of the quality of education that they provide to local students.","There is no reason not to support energy exploration in ANWR.","The U.S. now imports over half of its oil supply from the Middle East. This dangerous dependence on foreign energy sources is an issue of national security.","Stable energy prices and enhanced national security will only come when we increase domestic energy resources, which was accomplished today with the opening of ANWR.","Since September 11, 2001, the powerful coalition of nations, led by the United States, has seen many successes against al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups. It is imperative that we remain united and steadfast in the quest to defeat terrorism around the world.","Last year I traveled to the Middle East to visit with troops in Kuwait, Iraq, and Afghanistan.","In our Nation, approximately 22.5 million children ride school buses to and from school each day, which accounts for 54 percent of all students attending grade school.","In order for America to remain a global leader in innovation and opportunity, we must give our children a solid foundation in math and science.","I wish the Peace Corps and its volunteers continued success and perseverance. We are grateful for their contributions to society and dedication to providing assistance where it is needed. May the Peace Corps continue its legacy of service, both at home and abroad.","I am proud to represent these men and women who empower people in developing nations and promote the Peace Corps mission of peace and friendship. These volunteers are making major strides to improve the lives of people and communities around the world.","America and its allies are engaged in a war against a terrorist movement that spans all corners of the globe. It is sparked by radical ideologues that breed hatred, oppression, and violence against all of their declared enemies."],"Kenny Ortega":["I felt Michael Jackson was inspired a little bit more from the elegance of a Fred Astaire. Michael loved Sammy Davis, Jr. and James Brown and Judy Garland and Fred Astaire. But he wasn't any of those people. To be inspired is one thing, but he made it all his own.","I like to know who I'm working with, and it's important because they've got to be able to bring something to the party.","I grew up in a wonderful blend of a lot of old culture.","There's an old Fred Astaire movie where the stage becomes bigger and deeper and more complex. Moments like that really did impact on me and influence me.","If you're a young person who wants to become an actor, it's really important to walk into a casting room with a sense of yourself and some life experience. You can really delight a room and have them already choose you before you've even said a word!","To want to be an actor is enough - you don't need to tell us about it. The interesting person who comes with some life experience is always the person who is going to be chosen by me.","Patrick Swayze reminded me a lot of Gene Kelly. Patrick had that Everyman quality. Gene made dancing sort of an accessible idea for the regular guy out there.","Whenever you went into any place where there was Michael Jackson footage at Sony, it was like going through Homeland Security.","I was working in theater, so I didn't get to go to my prom."],"Kenny Price":["Businessmen and corporate men watch 'Hee Haw.' With that kind of audience, how can they take it off?","All I thought about when I was a kid was getting my guitar and entertaining people.","'Hee Haw' began about the same time as 'Laugh-In,' but the difference was that the material on 'Laugh-In' was more sophisticated: people looked out windows. On 'Hee Haw,' they look out of cornfields."],"Kenny Rogers":["Don't be afraid to give up the good for the great.","There is a trade off - as you grow older you gain wisdom but you lose spontaneity.","You gotta know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, know when to walk away, know when to run.","Here's what I've learned about raising boys... if you keep 'em busy, they're fine. You let 'em get bored, they'll dismantle your house board by board.","There has to be chemistry in a duet, but if you go beyond the point of friendship and attraction, you lose something.","You know, I think the greatest gift in the world is a good employee, you know, or people who can do your work for you and do it well the way you'd like to have it done. And I've always been able to surround myself with really good people.","I'm so totally future oriented that, for me, I don't know what the future's about, but I can promise you it's gonna be exciting.","When I think of the things I have, it makes me a little uneasy. I don't want people to think I've lost touch with reality.","I just hope I can spread some of the happiness that's been coming my way.","I've always said that gray hair looks good on everybody but yourself. To me, it makes me look old.","I'm much more comfortable singing than talking.","Growing older is not upsetting; being perceived as old is.","Know when to hold 'um, know when to fold 'um and know when to walk away from cameramen.","You know, when you're poor and you have a bunch of kids in your family, you don't know that everybody's not poor.","I had holes in my jeans well before it was fashionable.","I have awards right now that I do not remember walking on stage to get.","The first six years of my career, I got more comments on my weight than on my singing. So I think I became so self-conscious that I started working on it harder.","I think when you're in the public eye, you feel a pressure to stay younger looking.","You know, I've always said, I've never felt I was a particularly good singer, but I've always thought I had a great knack for picking hit songs.","I feel like I learn something from everything I do.","Well, I don't think everything necessarily that I touch turns to gold, but I think I get great joy out of it regardless of whether it is successful or not.","I was raised in the church.","My mom loved to sing - and I'll go on record and say she was the worst singer ever. I'd get up and move away from her!","There's a new hit rock group or singer every five minutes, but with country music, you have one hit and those people love you forever.","My music was my life, and it played a large part in my inability to sustain relationships.","I think it's fun to play for people who don't know what you do.","People will clap to be nice. They will not laugh to be nice.","If you want people to know what your message is, just sing it.","I've always said music should make you laugh, make you cry or make you think.","I still like going on the road and performing, but it's getting tougher. I try to have my wife and the twins with me but it's getting harder and harder for them. They need to be in a home environment and not traveling with me.","It is difficult to get played at my age on the radio.","Radio is aimed at the 30-year-old market, so you have to have great music and appeal to get that age group. And you need a record company to believe in you. It's like a bit of the perfect storm."],"Kenny Scharf":["I'm constantly doing new stuff. I'm always excited. I'm a one-man tornado.","Part of what I do and what I want to do is I want to bring art into the everyday life. If you can take ordinary just walking in the street and you're confronted by something, that might change your day - it might inspire you.","I always thought it would be a great thing to do an art carwash. So you can actually go and get your car washed, but while you're sitting around waiting you can walk in that hallway where you look at the cars going through the window, and that could be changing exhibitions."],"Kenny Troutt":["I can remember living in the housing projects and being broke like it was yesterday.","I have this philosophy that A and B students work for C students.","That kid who lives in the projects, he has a self-esteem problem - everybody looks down on him. He may be a good kid, but other parents don't want their kids to be with them because percentages say they could be bad. I went through a lot of that.","My mom was born poor, raised poor, and was going to die poor.","When I was in high school, my uncle, who went to the races quite a bit, got me interested. Then when I went to college at Southern Illinois University, just a few hours from Louisville, we used to go to the Kentucky Derby, and I got to see Secretariat and Riva Ridge win.","In the 1970s, I bought some cheap horses, then decided that if I was going to be in it, I was going to go big time. So in 2001, Bill Casner, a partner with me in Excel, and I bought a breeding farm, WinStar Farm, together.","I go to the farm generally every other week, but I'm on the phone with them every day, and I watch every race on TV. Not a day goes by when I'm not working on that.","I say a little prayer every time I see a race. I say a little prayer that the riders and the horses will be okay.","I was in oil when oil was $8 a barrel and in construction when interest rates were 20 percent. I was looking for something everyone used and where you could build a customer base - and if it was successful, you could take it nationwide and even worldwide.","The industry should take comfort in knowing that WinStar is my main focus after my faith and family."],"Kenny Wormald":["I have a really good family. I'm lucky to have people who support me and love me in my life.","The whole bullying issue has really struck a nerve with me. It affects so many different types of people at a vital time in their lives.","I used to get made fun of a lot for being a male dancer, especially growing up in Boston. Kids are terrible, they don't realize how heavy words can be.","L.A. fashion is like lip injections. That confuses me. That's become not just a thing. It's become fashion, part of your outfit. But hey, to each his own.","I've always fought for what I believe in. I used to get made fun of for dancing, and I would argue back, or fight the kids, or do whatever I had to do to shut them up. I have that in me.","I'm from Boston, and I'm hard-headed, opinionated and a good arguer.","You have to be determined, and be able to accept, 'No.' I've heard, 'No,' a thousand times, and I've heard, 'Yes,' a handful of times.","You can only dance for so long, but you can act until you're dead, so... I fell in love with it and I want to keep doing it and pushing myself.","I'm a big fan of all the Boston guys that are acting - Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Mark Wahlberg - they made a great career out of it, and they found a way to do it and still be cool guys, so that's kind of where I want to be.","I was a dancer, and it's not really cool for a boy to dance, so it was inspiring to see a movie like 'Footloose' where a guy is dancing masculine and had a proper reason behind it. It made me feel cool, and when these kids would make fun of me, I'd be like, 'Oh, didn't you see 'Footloose,' man?'","I mean, there's definitely a difference between film and live performances or live television. But at the same time, it's just performing. No matter what, it's performing.","I enjoy the element of pushing yourself, learning something new, whether it's a dance step, a scene, an emotion.","I love a good argument and sometimes I have a hard time keeping my mouth shut if I think someone is wrong... I've always fought for what I believe in, and I don't quit until I have accomplished what I set out to do."],"Kent Beck":["Developer testing is an important step towards accountability. It gives developers a way to demonstrate the quality of the software they produce.","Extreme programming is an emotional experience.","Agitator and the Agitar Management Dashboard lower the barriers to accountability in software development and increase the value of developer testing.","There is a strong movement towards increased accountability for software developers and software development organizations.","First you learn the value of abstraction, then you learn the cost of abstraction, then you're ready to engineer.","The world is changing, and I believe that, if I want to stay employed as a programmer, I'm going to have to change with it.","I think it's a combination of technical and social factors that leads to all the defects in deployed software.","I found out that most programmers don't like to test their software as intensely as I do.","Whether you draw diagrams that generate code or you type at a browser, you are coding.","The problem is, in software design, often the consequences of your decisions don't become apparent for years.","One of the advantages of having to live with JUnit for 8 years is now we can look back and see which decisions we made worked nicely and which we would have done differently.","There's a huge latent market for software development that's just flat-out honest.","I used Agitator on some code I had unit-tested, and it made me a better tester. As an Agitar Fellow, I look forward to the leverage of working with an outstanding organization as together we continue to improve the value of developer testing.","I lived near Santa Cruz for ten years, and the whole time, it bothered me what an exclusionary definition of 'inclusion' was in force. Social censure was applied to those who expressed unpopular or uncomfortable ideas.","There are musicians who want to make a living making music. There are listeners who want to listen to music. Complicating this relationship is a whole bunch of history: some of the music I want to listen to was made a while ago in a different economy. Some of the models of making a living making music are no longer valid but persist.","My great-grandfather played organ for silent movies. Talkies in, Gramps out.","When Pandora doesn't pay, and bars don't pay, and weddings don't pay, and nobody buys CDs or shirts or concert tickets or lessons, then the musician can't make a living making music.","Sheet music, recording, radio, television, cassettes, CD burners, and file sharing have all invalidated, to some extent, the old model of making a living making music.","Received wisdom is that if you spend time up front getting the design right, you avoid costs later. But the longer you spend getting the design right, the more your upfront costs are, and the longer it takes for the software to start earning.","A rational model of software is to design it quickly - the economic pressure to improvise presents an interesting challenge.","Design should be easy in the sense that every step should be obviously and clearly identifiable. Simplify elements to make change simple so you can manage the technical risk.","Organizations want small changes in functionality on a more regular basis. An organization like Flickr deploys a new version of its software every half hour. This is a cycle that feeds on itself.","We could talk, act, and dress funny. We were excused for socially inappropriate behavior: 'Oh, he's a programmer'. It was all because we knew this technology stuff that other people found completely mystifying.","People are looking for software development that actually does something useful... People are looking for partners who deliver when promised, and at a reasonable and transparent price. I believe that the days of being able to value price software are numbered.","The marketing of XP is very deliberate and conscious. Part of it is in co-opting the power of the media; I make sure I'm newsworthy from time to time. Part is in co-opting some of my publisher's ad budget.","If I'd had a charisma-ectomy in the beginning, XP would have gone nowhere."],"Kent Conrad":["Access to computers and the Internet has become a basic need for education in our society.","We shouldn't just live for today; we should prepare for tomorrow.","When Republicans used reconciliation in 2001 for the Bush tax cuts, they used it to increase the deficit. The whole purpose of reconciliation is for deficit reduction!","We've got to have major health care reform because that is the 800-pound gorilla. That is the thing that can swamp the boat fiscally for the United States.","The President is not squaring with the American people as to the seriousness of our nation's fiscal condition. It is time for people to stand up and tell the truth.","It is vital that we provide North Dakota's children with nutritionally sound diets. That means ensuring that they are getting plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, and are developing good eating habits for their future.","Anybody who has stood on the prairie in North Dakota has felt the force of the wind and knows that our state has an inexhaustible supply of wind power. The potential here to create jobs and draw millions of dollars in new investment to North Dakota is enormous.","I've had lengthy discussions with European farm leaders. It is clear they have an agricultural strategy to support their producers and gain dominance in world agricultural trade. They're gaining markets the old-fashioned way - they're buying them.","Welfare reform happened with reconciliation; half the Democrats voted for it. The Bush tax cuts happened with reconciliation; twelve Democratic Senators voted for it. You didn't have a real partisan issue on those times that it was used.","Reconciliation cannot be used to pass comprehensive health care reform. It won't work because it was never designed for that kind of significant legislation; it was designed for deficit reduction.","The only possible role that I can see for reconciliation would be to make modest changes in the major package to improve affordability, to deal with what share of Medicaid expansion the federal government pays, those kinds of issues, which is the traditional role for reconciliation in health care.","Reducing our dependence on foreign energy - that is critically important to America's economic future. Excellence in education - if we're not the best educated, we're not going to be the most powerful for very long.","Governments can inflate their way out of debt, but that has consequences, doesn't it?","Social Security has not contributed to the deficit problem.","When you're borrowing 40 cents of every dollar that you spend, that can't continue much longer. I think everybody really does understand that, and it's going to require all of us - those who are the most fortunate among us - but it's really going to require every American to contribute to a solution.","The American people say, 'Don't touch Social Security, don't touch Medicare, don't cut defense.' That's 84 percent of the federal budget.","America was founded on majority rule, not supermajority rule. Somehow, over the years, this has morphed into supermajority rule, and that changes things.","One reason the Founding Fathers thought that states should have two senators was so that smaller states wouldn't get run over and could bring their interests to the attention of the Senate more broadly.","Highway spending, which I think most everybody says is badly needed in this country, creates American jobs, and also makes America more competitive.","Certainly Social Security needs to be reformed.","There are large cooperatives all across this country. Land O'Lakes is a $12 billion club functioning all across America. There are rural electric co-ops in 47 states. Ace Hardware is a cooperative.","I would do away with super PACs. I think it's a cancer."],"Kent Haruf":["I'm attempting to broaden my novels' scope through landscape and weather, leaves falling off trees, overnight storms, timeless elements which, irrespective of human endeavour, have always been there and, as long as there is life and snow, will always be there.","I think that usually the risk in trying to write children in fiction is the tendency to make them too cute or something.","I enjoy bluegrass, folk, gospel, and classical. I don't listen to music when I write. I sometimes listen to music just before I sit down to write.","I write in a journal first, briefly. Then read something I've read many times before, for about half an hour, then rework what I wrote the day before.","I began writing seriously in my mid-20s and didn't publish my first book until I was 41.","Death is a fact of life, no matter where you live. Taking care of the dying is a necessity everywhere. Those are not conditions exclusive to small towns.","Writing is the hardest thing I know, but it was the only thing I wanted to do. I wrote for 20 years and published nothing before my first book.","We'd do better to follow the admonition of Jesus about loving our neighbours. People in the U.S. are capable of forgiveness and willing to see one another's point of view, but when matters become politicised, we're less able to do that.","In terms of showing their emotions and acting on them, my women characters are a lot more advanced than the men.","Writers who aren't from rural states in the Midwest or the West often treat such people as if they were the Waltons or the Beverly Hillbillies.","Fame isn't healthy for a writer."],"Kent McCord":["I'm interested in raw land and trees and fresh air and rivers and lots of animals around them.","Friends, near or far, are important to us. All of ours have an awareness of other persons' feelings, a courtesy that's inevitable. When I find that consideration in a fan, I'm immediately impressed.","A person who cares deeply about what people need in their lives is someone I'll never forget.","Whenever I get a free day, I drive up to some part of California that looks promising on the map.","Well, I grew up in a tough neighborhood.","True friendships don't fade in Hollywood, as so many myths about show business would have you insist.","That first year at Universal was a big blur and, naturally, I thought they were wasting me. I didn't realize at the time that I was learning my craft and acting more easily in front of the camera.","Some of the greatest writers in our industry can't get work.","Not only that - college doesn't particularly qualify you for the outside world. he world is changing so fast, and college is not. It should strive to be more in tune with the world.","Meanwhile, Cynthia and I are busy fixing up a real old house that we just bought in Hollywood. With two children now, we just couldn't live in our small rented home any longer.","Instead, most colleges are studies in obsolescence.","If I find what I like, maybe in about five years we'll be able to afford to build a home in the country.","I've been lucky - I've been an actor for eight years and I've never been out of work.","I'll admit I wanted to be a pilot, originally.","I want my children to live in the country, to be a part of nature.","I think the most important thing my wife Cynthia and I can do for Kristen is to teach her how to grow up to be a woman and make her own decisions. Meanwhile, we sometimes have to guide her.","I think children learn from example. I don't believe in raising them in an authoritative atmosphere.","I noticed that almost everyone I went to college with has worked at something other than the subject they majored in. I guess that' s one of the reasons for campus unrest.","I met Cynthia when I was 12, proposed at 16, became engaged at 17, married her at 19 and we had a baby when I was 20. If extra work could pay for a lot of diapers, that was for me.","I longed to fly. I was paid in flying lessons and, by the time I was 13, I'd logged 100 hours at the controls.","I feel that education needs an overhaul - courses are obsolete and grades are on the way out.","I answer a fan with a hearing heart first.","Frequently parents forget that children are people. I don't try to treat Kristen as an adult, but I do try to treat her as a person, with a child's sensibilities.","Cynthia and I are very alike in our tastes.","A policeman, as you discover, has to put up with a hell of a lot of abuse. A man in any other line of work would nail a guy who laid that kind of abuse on him. I know I would."],"Kent Nerburn":["Until you have a son of your own... you will never know the joy, the love beyond feeling that resonates in the heart of a father as he looks upon his son.","Care less for your harvest than for how it is shared and your life will have meaning and your heart will have peace.","Remember to be gentle with yourself and others. We are all children of chance and none can say why some fields will blossom while others lay brown beneath the August sun.","Remember that you don't choose love; love chooses you. All you really can do is accept it for all its mystery when it comes into your life. Feel the way it fills you to overflowing then reach out and give it away.","It is much easier to become a father than to be one.","Do not fall prey to the false belief that mastery and domination are synonymous with manliness.","Love has its own time, its own season, and its own reasons from coming and going. You cannot bribe it or coerce it or reason it into staying. You can only embrace it when it arrives and give it away when it comes to you."],"Kenyon Martin":["If you're a kid, it's all you think about if you stutter. Kids can be so mean. My grades suffered. Class participation weighs heavy in grading, and I wouldn't open my mouth to read or talk in front of anyone.","Basketball is what got me out of the projects. It got my momma the house she never had, the car she never had. Nobody is going to get the best of me. You might score more points than me, but you're going to know you were in a dogfight.","I have feelings, but not when it comes to basketball. I'm here to win. I'm not here to make friends.","I didn't have a father when I was growing up, and I vowed to be there with my kids.","I think I'm pretty coachable. I do what coaches ask of me.","I know the game well. I'm a student of basketball; I know what it takes to win.","I don't back down. Like, I don't know how to flop. That's never been a part of my game. For me to know if a guy likes to turn left shoulder or right shoulder in the post, I have an advantage. Or if he likes to go left all the time, I have an advantage. Or if he can't make open jump shots, I have an advantage.","Of course there's some things that I would have liked to have... none of my friends growing up had their father in the house. None of 'em. We had uncles and stuff like that, but nobody had a father in the house, none of my friends.","People don't know. People are ignorant. They feel that if you stutter, then you're slow or whatnot."],"Kenza Fourati":["There is nothing more dangerous for a population than self-censorship by fear.","To be very sincere, I don't feel legit being an inspiration of anything.","I want a country where you can express different ideas peacefully and not be bothered and arrested unfairly for it. I want a country where you shouldn't be scared to say that you are an atheist, for example.","My father was the nurturing one, the one who always made sure my sister and I ate properly and that our hair was brushed... He really took care of the logistics of our upbringing.","I think Tunisia has a specific place in the Arab world and in Africa because it is a tiny Muslim country, but it's very open minded. It's the first country to start the Arab Spring, for example.","If you were asking me how it is to be a Muslim in America, it's much harder to be a North African in France than to be a foreigner here in America.","The first time I came to New York, I was 14. I was on holiday, and I loved it! I knew that I would come back to live here. It's a city that makes you feel, very quickly, at home.","Women are very powerful! That's why I believe in women's rights and why I fight for it.","I'm a firm believer that your lifestyle plays a key role in the state of your complexion.","My skincare routine is pretty minimal. My must-have products are rose water, witch hazel, Embryolisse Creme, and Dr. Colbert's Eye Cream.","Living in a polluted city like New York, I try to go on hikes upstate as much as I can.","After a shower, I slather my limbs with coconut oil or rose oil and pat dry. I use a dry brush to exfoliate several times a week to keep my skin smooth."],"Kenzaburo Oe":["I am one of the writers who wish to create serious works of literature which dissociate themselves from those novels which are mere reflections of the vast consumer cultures of Tokyo and the subcultures of the world at large.","By reading Huckleberry Finn I felt I was able to justify my act of going into the mountain forest at night and sleeping among the trees with a sense of security which I could never find indoors.","The Japanese chose the principle of eternal peace as the basis of morality for our rebirth after the War.","After I got married, the first child born to us was mentally handicapped.","Even though we now have the half-century-old new Constitution, there is a popular sentiment of support for the old one that lives on in reality in some quarters.","My observation is that after one hundred and twenty years of modernisation since the opening of the country, present-day Japan is split between two opposite poles of ambiguity.","Paradoxically, the people and state of Japan living on such moral props were not innocent but had been stained by their own past history of invading other Asian countries.","I have survived by representing these sufferings of mine in the form of the novel.","The ambiguous orientation of Japan drove the country into the position of an invader in Asia.","The way Japan had tried to build up a modern state modelled on the West was cataclysmic.","After the end of the Second World War it was a categorical imperative for us to declare that we renounced war forever in a central article of the new Constitution.","However, please allow me to say that the fundamental style of my writing has been to start from my personal matters and then to link it up with society, the state and the world.","As I grew up, I was continually to suffer hardships in different realms of life - in my family, in my relationship to Japanese society and in my way of living at large in the latter half of the twentieth century.","From another point of view, a new situation now seems to be arising in which Japan's prosperity is going to be incorporated into the expanding potential power of both production and consumption in Asia at large.","In Japan itself there have all along been attempts by some to obliterate the article about renunciation of war from the Constitution and for this purpose they have taken every opportunity to make use of pressures from abroad.","In the recent years there have been criticisms levelled against Japan suggesting that she should offer more military forces to the United Nations forces and thereby play a more active role in the keeping and restoration of peace in various parts of the world."],"Kenzo Tange":["There is a powerful need for symbolism, and that means the architecture must have something that appeals to the human heart. There is a powerful need for symbolism, and that means the architecture must have something that appeals to the human heart.","Designs of purely arbitrary nature cannot be expected to last long.","Architects today tend to depreciate themselves, to regard themselves as no more than just ordinary citizens without the power to reform the future.","I feel however, that we architects have a special duty and mission... (to contribute) to the socio-cultural development of architecture and urban planning.","Tradition can, to be sure, participate in a creation, but it can no longer be creative itself.","In my opinion, further consideration of those views will help us find a way out of the current impasse, and reveal to us the kinds of buildings and cities required by the informational society.","I am aware of changes gradually taking place in my own designs as part of my thinking on this matter.","Technological considerations are of great importance to architecture and cities in the informational society."],"Kerby Jean-Raymond":["All clothes are worn on the street, but 'streetwear' had once described T-shirt brands and skate-inspired brands, and now it's just a lazy innuendo used to describe clothing made by designers that the establishment deems 'less than.'","Systemically, there hasn't been an oppression more overt and long-lasting than economic oppression against black people and minorities in this country.","I came back from Standing Rock, and one of the things that struck me was their respect for elders. It was something that I felt like I needed to work on in my life.","In my shows, I always try to incorporate music because it's the most natural way to set a tone. So if I want to do a show about depression, I use the opera. If I want to do a show about greed, I use spoken word. If I want to do a show about the injustice that's taking place in the world, I might play Sam Cooke.","Think about how much fashion profits from black culture and how underrepresented we are in the industry. If you insist on using black celebrities to peddle your merchandise and add a cool factor to your front row, it is indecent to not care about the plights of that person's community.","Our first fiscal year, we were profitable.","Nobody can shut the door in your face if you own the door.","America is a flawed land but a great one indeed.","The work of black creatives seems to always get undermined in one way or another, and that's what this new generation is actively changing by speaking up. We aren't accepting group categorization and group classifications to describe our work anymore - it just leads to group dismissal.","I hope that people who don't believe depression is a real thing will stop calling people crazy, because that's dismissive and not a medical diagnosis.","I think that when you rally powerful voices around powerful issues, what you get are positive results.","You have these megabrands who make most of their money off hip-hop culture. Where were they in the time of need?","I want to be fashion's Erykah Badu. What I admire about her is her timelessness and her fearless approach.","Music has always been my first love, and I appreciate how a great musician can bring awareness to tough issues through their work.","I've always felt like an outcast. My aesthetic is very high-end, but I still get classified as streetwear. There's really no other reason for than other than my age, the way I look, and where I'm from.","If you put the collections together, whether it's Rick Owens, Alexander Wang, or whomever, sometimes they do streetwear, but they're never called that. They're always called 'sportswear' or 'high-end' or 'luxury.' I feel like I'm tossed into that streetwear category so that I don't exist in this space.","With things that I'm going through, whether they be on a small scale or a large scale, I'm thinking, 'Who else is going through this? And how can I address it and bring it to light to help someone else?'","'Bernie versus Bernie,' for me, is these two extremes of capitalism. It's Bernie Sanders, the ultimate socialist, and Bernie Madoff, the ultimate capitalist.","We're constantly having to go head-to-head with the Bernie Madoffs of the world who just want more and more money.","A lot of us who are creative and have all these great ideas just don't have the money to do it.","I don't think the narrative I was stuck in - the 'black' designer category - was going to go away anytime soon.","My dad was always so strict that I was scared to speak to him. Haitian parents are very, 'This is adults' business; this is kids' business.'","The way I was raised, you get a new pair of sneakers when the old one gets messed up. But when I got to high school, I started dating girls and trying to fit in, and I realized everybody was collecting Jordans. When I would get my paychecks, I wouldn't even take money. I would just trade them for sneakers.","I grew up thinking my father was tacky. There was no color coordination. It was whatever was cool. 'These sweatpants are cool. I'll wear them with these shoes that are cool.' He had less inhibitions. I wasn't respectful of his swag then.","There were times when gangs would approach me, but my father was way stronger than them. They would come make threats and stuff, and I was like, 'You don't know the opposition I've got upstairs. I'm not scared of you.'","All my collections are based on something I like or something I'm dealing with. They are always deeply personal.","All it took was one conversation to know that Reebok was the right home for our team.","I wanted to be a sneaker designer since I was 10; it was my dream to work at Nike and design signature shoes for Michael Jordan and Penny Hardaway. When it was time to select high schools, I wanted to go to one that would help me get a jump-start on my dream.","I've never seen Ralph Lauren, Rick Owens, or Raf Simons described as white designers. They are just designers.","Is the 'black designer' label there to warn everyone not to have the same level of expectations for me, or is it some type of prize? I just want to work in an even playing field where I can get press for my work and not just my race and my personal views on it.","Financing is always the hard part, especially if you don't have friends or family to back you, which was my case and the case for most designers.","My earliest memories of defying my parents were through music. I remember rap being banned in my house, and then getting a Cam'ron album.","I don't know which was the first love - music or fashion.","I grew up in East Flatbush, Brooklyn. At the time I was growing up with my father - before it was gentrified - it was a very rough neighborhood. He felt that if I got into or started embracing the rap culture, I would be one step closer to being on the streets.","I was going to college on a full scholarship. I graduated summa cum laude. I was always on the dean's list. I was never a kid that started any kind of trouble.","One of the things about runways that I hate is that you can't accommodate so many people because you don't have those in-and-out privileges where people can come and go.","I played baseball, was on the basketball team in high school, did crew at Hofstra, and randomly played ultimate frisbee, too. But none of the organized teams I was on were anywhere near as competitive as the games on the street.","We're always ready for a pick-up game. I walk through the park on the way home every day and just think to myself, 'I'll take on any of these kids.'","My dad used to give me old electrical equipment that didn't work anymore, and I'd put things together. I think that's why I like to mix things that don't belong.","I design for social media. My customer reads blogs, is on social media, so I design with contrast in mind. An all-black shirt looks good on the shelf but not online.","If I'm going to be the black designer, I'm going to tell it my way.","I'm desperately trying to unplug. The last thing I want is a watch that connects to my phone which connects to my iPad that connects to my computer that airplays to my TV.","A president's power is limited. We need to vote down the ballot as well, from your councilman all the way up to your governors and congressman.","We don't need to go back in time and make America great again, because really, America was only great for certain people.","We need to think forward and keep making America greater. Not that old America, again.","In September of 2015, I did the unthinkable: I used my second-ever runway show to bring awareness to the Black Lives Matter movement. It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do professionally. It was lonely.","If you're on the fence about speaking your truth or sharing your world with a greater audience, don't be. We need each other badly.","The world absolutely needs your voice."],"Keren Ann":["Everything is temporary. Everything is bound to end.","I think many experiences are bound to be failures, and sometimes I regret them before they even happen.","When you write songs, you can't really point out the exact thing you're inspired by. It's more a state or a mood or an atmosphere that you're trying to put into words.","When you record, you live with what you recorded for many many years, but when you play it's just an hour and a half and then once it's over it's over.","Well, I grew up between Holland and Israel and then moved to France when I was eleven.","Sometimes you're trapped in writing songs and you don't have enough distance from what you do anymore and you need the talent and the years of other people to come and jump in.","So usually even if you like a sentence or a story or something, it won't come out that way - it'll come out years later, and in a different way, and you don't really control that.","It's always a mixture of fiction and your own story. It's more I recreate atmospheres and moods through songs.","It was an hour and a half plane ride, so I slept. I try to sleep because that's probably the only time I get to get my real sleep. When I can't sleep I read books or watch movies.","If I look at it, it's about being able to get lost in New York, to explore the city, to have more personal stories about New York, although some could also take place in Paris.","I'm very attached to Paris because I have a base there and am also recording there, but New York is home to me when I'm in the U.S., because it's nice to have a bed to go back to.","I'm nothing more than what you actually see, but I am also the complete opposite.","I'm always on a train or a plane, so wherever I happen to be is home.","I was in the studio so much, it was about the search for air in a metaphoric sense, and the breathing has more to do with travel for me, about the search musically for open air.","I think it's very good to have regrets, to learn how to live with them.","I spend a lot of time writing in New York."],"Keri Hilson":["You can Photoshop something, put it out, and everyone believes it.","We all have something about ourselves that we'd change if we could in a perfect world, be it our body image, our financial status, our relationship, whatever. I wanted to talk about how nobody's exempted from the realities of life and all those things.","I don't want to live like a prisoner.","I've learned to duplicate my beauty regimen from drug store products.","It's not okay to just make up false things about someone, especially in their personal life. Professionally, fine! Scrutinize me all you want. I know that I can't please everyone, but personally, let's just leave it alone. It's going too far.","I prefer men to boys. To clear it up, it's not about an older or younger thing. It's a mindset, not age. There are 18-year-old men out there and there are 40-year-old boys.","We live in such a gullible world. Anything that's written, anything that's posted, anything picture that is interpreted one way is taken as truth.","I'll be honest; I'm a student of fashion. I say that because I just wear what I feel. I'm not led by name brands and things like that.","Even if you're walking through the airport or going to pick up your mail, if you meet a fan and they have a camera, they will take a picture of you and millions could potentially see that picture - if it's picked up by a blog or whatever.","I love the water; I love to swim.","I felt that with 'In A Perfect World' I was still kind of finding myself - not just as a musician, but also in love and in life.","I grew up in an all-black neighbourhood in Decatur, Georgia - a kinda lower-middle-class area.","My mother - who's from Iowa - owns and runs her own day-care centre, while my father's a developer. And my musical influences, I think, came from my father's side of the family.","My grandmother would sing in the choir, while my dad - while he was in college - sang and recorded with a quartet. So yeah, it was definitely my dad's Southern side that impacted on me musically.","I always feel compelled to lend my voice to things I strongly believe in.","Most things I go through I have to write about.","To be honest with my music... for me to expect anyone to connect it has to come from a place of honesty.","Really, I'm the type of girl, and I know other girls who are the types of girls who it's not about the chain, it's not about the car, not about the house or this, that, and the other that you think are impressing me. It's really the intellect. It's really stimulating my mind.","I know as a consumer I want a story. I want a defining - I don't want just an album full of singles. I want to get to know the artist beyond what everyone else can hear on the radio.","I think the sophomore curse happens when you change every bit of yourself. Though my hair is blonde now, sonically it's still the same girl; conceptually it's still the same girl.","My favorite drugstore product is Clean and Clear makeup removing cleanser. It gets the makeup off in one wash - not three or four.","Even at my biggest, I want to be writing for other artists. Even at my peak - the highest I can be as an artist - I always want to be keeping my creative juices flowing, keeping money in the bank, putting my intellectual property out there.","Years ago, I wanted to be like the girl Ne-Yo. You know, with the mid-tempo ballads - I come from the Babyface era. But that's not trendy; that's not hip-hop.","I'm born and raised in Georgia, so I have a lot of appreciation for hip-hop, but I want to be able to show the emotional side of me.","My dad used to sing in a quartet. He loved everything: adult contemporary, anything smooth. He'd listen to the quartets.","I don't have a beef with any female artist.","There have been situations where the people you're around have one vision for you, and it's like trying on a jacket that doesn't fit.","Timbaland's so wishy-washy sometimes - he'll hate a song at first and then love it, and then maybe go back to not liking it as much as something else.","When I'm writing a song for another artist, I purposefully make it not for me; otherwise, I get too attached.","Songwriting was always my 'plan B'. I didn't even know that songwriting was a job until my late teens!"],"Keri Russell":["Sometimes it's the smallest decisions that can change your life forever.","People expect all women to react the same to pregnancy. But anyone who's been around pregnant women knows that it's not all cutesy and sweet. You spaz out and you're angry and you have tantrums.","I want to be able to raise my kid. I was totally being a martyr about it at first, thinking I could totally do it on my own, which I did for a while. I've hired a babysitter before, but as for a full-time caregiver... for a control freak like me, it ain't gonna happen!","Who knows? Maybe years from now I'll be on a ranch in Colorado with 10 kids. The whole point of life is to experience a little bit of everything, and I think it's better when there are a few surprises thrown in.","It's sad when girls think they don't have anything going on except being pretty.","Yeah, I like being on my own. I do. I tend to be a loner, so I'm okay. I'm not okay when I have to be around everyone all the time.","I'm naturally thin, so I don't have to work too hard at it. I love food, but I also love to work out. I think it makes everything work better.","I am literally the worst person at keeping secrets. I'd be the worst spy of all time.","Acting is a strange profession, and, yes, sometimes I struggle with its worth, its value in the world.","I am crazy for dessert. I eat everything. No one should be denied anything... just don't eat the whole thing.","Dance is definitely what I love doing much more than anything else.","People - not just in their teenage years - hold on to this fantasy of love when they're not ready to have a real relationship.","Acting happened to me. If I had pursued it, I think it would have been like someone going to a bar, desperately looking for love and not finding anyone.","I'm not okay when I have to be around everyone all the time.","People still take it really personally. They come up to me at breakfast places like, 'When are you growing your hair back?'","Anything that opens you up emotionally is going to impact your acting. Parenthood, becoming a mom, certainly does that.","I know not every mom is a secret KGB spy, but every mom has this whole other life. Every dad and every person has this whole other life.","I was a huge fan of 'Arrested Development,' and there's just something it tickles in me and it's bright and it's hilarious.","When I was on the 'Mickey Mouse Club,' there was Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake and Ryan Gosling and Christine Aguilera. But they were 12 and I was 17, so there was a bit of an age difference.","I am positive I was not a neglected child. I remember reading 'The Jungle Book' and 'The Sleeping Beauty.'","Personally, I'm a real wimp with scary movies. I get so scared.","I think people like to be thrilled and excited. And a scary movie is a safe way to do that because you're not actually doing it. It's entertainment. You know that you're in the confines of this two-hour space of safety in the movie house.","Dance has helped me with everything. It was a great foundation for discipline, hard work and, unfortunately, the ever-elusive idea of perfection. It lends itself easily to fight choreography, because that's what it really is. Choreography. And knowing how to move with someone.","I don't have time for any special skin routines. Many a night I go to bed with the gloppy mascara and all.","I like getting to be in the adult world a little bit and then getting to be in the mom world and cook dinners. And, for me, that balance is what makes it nice.","I stayed really physical during my pregnancy. I stuck to my normal pre-pregnancy workout, minus the stomach exercises and twisting. I really felt it helped my whole well-being.","Naps are the key to relieving stress. When you are working on two hours of sleep, the fact that cheese comes on something when you ordered it with no cheese is enough to send you crying under the covers for an hour.","I love doing laundry! It's so satisfying. I love the way it smells. I love doing the sheets.","I would splurge on a great pair of high heels, because you can wear them to something fancy, but regular clothes? I'd rather go on a trip than spend $10,000 on clothes, and fly first class as a treat.","Everyone should dance more. Everyone should walk more.","While 'Felicity' was successful in the States, and I had opportunities to do other stuff, I didn't want to do anything to make myself more famous. I wasn't dealing well with the celebrity of all of that. I was 23 - just a kid - and not coming from money, it was all just too much. I just wanted to slow it down a little bit, and gain control.","I don't think I ate a green vegetable until I was 30. I didn't grow up with a mom who enforced that at all."],"Keri Smith":["I do not see the process of blogging as a separate thing from creating art. This is in part why I do not like to be known for being a 'blogger,' as this is just one form of output for creative ideas.","We're drawn to making our mark, leaving a record to show we were here, and a journal is a great place to do it. Once you start drawing, writing, and gluing stuff in every day, it can quickly become a habit - addictive, even. Your attitude should be: 'I can do this, but I mustn't make it too intimidating.'","Something different happens to my brain when I put pen to paper: the pace of writing or drawing slows you down and gives you more time for thoughts to come in.","What I'm doing is trying to get kids to pay attention, to look at the physical world more, and to question everything. I am trying to get kids out of the house and away from screens.","In order to be who you are as a human being, you need to be willing to upset people.","I'm just hoping my children will get enough of a foundation to remember what it was like before technology, how good that feels. Because I remember.","I find the experience of keeping a journal much more creative on paper than on a computer. When I write, I'm physically immersed in the world and slow down, whereas on screen, I use my senses in a less engaged way - and I skim more.","A lot of people don't like to spend money on a journal because they're afraid to wreck it, which is understandable. I buy beautifully made leather-bound journals because I have lost my fear of the blank page.","I love the idea of a website/blog being a catalyst for propelling people out into the world, and I enjoy it most when people write me to say that their world looked or smelled or felt a little different because of something that I wrote.","One of the benefits of having an audience is that it requires a regimen, a need to create on a regular basis. I don't believe in waiting for the muse to visit.","The virtual world can never be a substitute for real world experience. And the more it takes over our lives, the more we forget to feel the sun on our skin, the more we forget that there is an entire universe to be discovered even during a 10 minute walk to work."],"Kerr Smith":["The people who watched 'Dawson's Creek' when it originally aired aren't too old to enjoy 'Life Unexpected.' And then you've got the whole next generation that's hooked on the 'Dawson's reruns seeing this show, so it's perfect for them.","It hasn't been until the last couple years that I've started playing close to my age. But it's fun playing the younger roles because it takes you back to the teen years.","As an actor, it's a very strange adjustment to start playing the father. I was used to playing a kid my whole life, and then all of a sudden, it's like, boom. I guess when I let my hair go grey, things changed.","When you're making TV, the last thing you want to do is watch TV. It's too much."],"Kerri Green":["I had a chance to get used to the lights and the camera without all that pressure to... emote.","I try to think of school - this is going to sound awful - as something I do in my free time.","It is so unexpected, it goes beyond my wildest dreams. Sometimes I just sit back and think. 'Oh my God, I'm in the movies!' It still hasn't sunk in.","I have always wanted to work with Steven R. Monroe, and when I read his script, I was blown away! I think 'Complacent' hits a nerve that people try so desperately to avoid, which is what I love about Steven's work."],"Kerri Strug":["I think sports are extremely beneficial for our youth. They parallel life in so many ways.","I think it's just really important for youth today to have a passion and pursue something seriously.","You always dream of going to the Olympics and winning gold. I've learned over the years that there are lots of gold medals, but certain stories stick out and make a difference.","As you get older, it's harder to maintain your weight and to fly through the air for those routines. It's also the lifestyle; you train seven to eight hours a day, five to six days a week.","I'm very Type A; I like to get my list done.","My entire adolescence was geared toward one thing: gymnastics.","I never went to my high school dance, and didn't date much."],"Kerri Walsh Jennings":["The balancing act of motherhood and a career, and being a wife, is something that I don't think I'll ever perfect, but I love the challenge of it.","My job is to be fit and I'm really blessed that I get to go and work out and live a really healthy lifestyle.","There's only one way to prepare for playing beach volleyball, and that's by getting in the sand.","I think the No. 1 thing that helps me get through every single day is the support of my friends and my family.","There's no shame in a bronze medal. I used to think that, and I'm so ashamed of thinking that because there's so much joy and hard work and love in this.","In my heart, I'm so far from done.","I used to sleep, eat, breathe volleyball. Now I have that with my kids.","There's worse things in life than to put sunscreen on. It means I'm going to work, which is on the beach, which is pretty wonderful.","It's the best thing in the world, the most challenging thing in the world, being a parent, and one of the first lessons I learned was to ask for help.","My mom is a constant in my life in so many ways.","I want to win a gold medal in London.","The advice I will give my children, if and when they have Olympic aspirations, will be to go for it.","Growing up, Michael Jordan was my Olympic hero.","Generally, I'll have three training sessions a day.","My mother is my biggest role model, and she showed me how to do it right. She was very present in our lives and has a great career of her own. Same with my father. So I knew it was possible going in to stay closely connected to my children while also chasing big dreams. And it's given me great perspective.","Prior to having babies, I thought - I thought I was so busy, and now I realize just how ignorant I was.","We're a pretty open-book family; we kind of lead with our hearts. There's nothing to hide.","No one behind you gets the appreciation they deserve.","In this journey, the fear creeps in from time to time. The hint of that is there because there's an unknown factor to everything. That's true in everyone's life. I don't choose to live there; I let it spark me.","The original way to play beach volleyball was in a bikini and board shorts, and I don't know what else they want us to wear.","When it comes to beach volleyball, we're playing in 100-degree-plus weather."],"Kerris Dorsey":["My favorite show is 'Parks and Recreation.'","I wish I had more movies I could watch with my parents and not feel super uncomfortable.","Cable television is such a part of our society now. Oftentimes, the shows are really good, and you're just like, 'Well, it's worth sitting through the sex and violence because the narrative is so great.'","I started in theatre, and that took me into film and television.","I did my first play around four or five. I can't remember the first one, but I did 'Annie' when I was five.","I have always been kind of really good at faking the sick voice, and I never really realized it because I would never use that power for evil.","I love dance; that's a big part of my life - like, ballet specifically.","Often when you're a teenage girl, you get sent characters that are so unenjoyable and unexciting.","I listen to music because that's such a huge part of my process; not to sound super pretentious, but that's a big part of what helps me get in character.","I started playing guitar when I was eight. Well, I started piano and really liked it but never practiced, but it taught me how to read music, and then my mom signed me up for guitar lessons, and I connected to that way more.","I listen to so much music every day, so that's such a big part of my life. To be able to pursue that and put out my own stuff is definitely a goal. I don't want to put something out that I'm not proud of because I think it's so easy to say, 'I'm an actress/musician.'"],"Kerry Bentivolio":["Whether stuck in traffic because of construction or fixing a flat tire after hitting a pothole, Michiganders feel frustrated with the quality of our roads.","When we empower our communities, we are all better off.","A broken transportation system hits Michiganders in the pocketbook. Every year, our friends and neighbors spend millions of dollars on car repairs after driving on crumbling streets."],"Kerry Bishe":["I was a mime. I'm not kidding. I went to Northwestern University and they have a mime company, so we did a lot of training and then a lot of mime shows around Chicago.","I think that some people like to be someone other than themselves when acting, while others are most themselves. I fall into the second camp. For me, acting is a great exercise in getting to the truth about myself.","I'm kind of a Luddite myself. I've got a bunch of typewriters at home. I'm a big fan of old technology.","I love smart and curious people. I value intelligence in my friends and relationships.","There are a great number of people from New Jersey who go on to have pretty successful careers.","To me, one of the things I love about being an actor is that it's never done; it's never perfect, and so it's the process. It's like practicing being okay with things not being perfect and things being outside of your control.","I did a lot of theater, so especially as an on-camera camera actor, there are so many things that aren't in your toolbox. They're somebody else's job. You think about editors and rhythm. Volume isn't even in your control.","The storytelling in a movie is in the cut; it's in the edit. It's not an actor's job, really. Your job is such a tiny little thing, and I love the feeling of juggling or tightrope walking.","I went to a Cal Tech party after the 'Facebook' movie came out, and there were kids in dark rooms coding because it was cool again. That movie made it cool to sit in a room at a party and write code.","I think it's really rare to see women on television who are brilliant, selfish, vain, fallible - and I feel like I have all those capacities in myself, so it's good to see people in the media representing all of those things.","I could never understand how to build a computer, but the best I could hope for is to understand the people that do."],"Kerry Condon":["I'm used to riding horses. My father used to breed horses when I was a child. I grew up in Tipperary, in the country, and lots of people have horses there. If my parents hadn't been in the business, we would have them anyway, as pets. And my cousin Richard is a jockey.","My very first acting job was with Alan Parker on' Angela's Ashes,' but as a child, I had written to so many other productions just applying for any role. I always wanted to be an actress, and I did loads of acting summer schools.","I know it's superficial, and you can't measure art, which is supposed to be up to the individual, but I've watched the Oscars since I was a baby with my mother.","I'm not panicking any more or worrying about the next job. It was exhausting and making me very unhappy, and I was missing out on life.","I'm pretty shy when I go home because I was pretty shy growing up, and I think I go back to that person.","Everyone at home thought I was nuts when I said I wanted to be an actress, and I'm sure they were just trying to protect me from disappointment.","I'm used to riding horses. My father used to breed horses when I was a child. I grew up in Tipperary, in the country, and lots of people have horses there.","All horses are different - sometimes they have a long neck - so you don't ride the same way on every horse. It depends on their body, and your body, but the object is to get down low so you're aerodynamic, so you call pull from the horse through the head. The best jockeys do that really well, and know how much to push.","I am an animal rights campaigner myself, and I donate money and time to those charities, but I think sometimes the problem with animal rights campaigners, including myself, is that we don't think about people's feelings, too.","I'm not interested in the mad race. I just like working with good people.","Sometimes I think I don't want to grow old as an actress and deal with the fact that I'm getting less jobs 'cause my face is changing, and then the men... But at the same time, I'm pretty competitive. I don't know if I'd bow out. I might still be acting when I'm in a wheelchair.","You think when you start getting jobs that it'll get easier, but that's the biggest lie ever. It gets harder. You have to put in more work. I wish it were the casting couch days because it'd be a lot easier!","I'm seeing a guy now who has nothing to do with films. It's so much nicer with somebody who isn't an actor. Two crazy people in one house would be too much. It's better there's one crazy person, and one nice person who looks after that crazy person."],"Kerry Greenwood":["The stories from World War I are worse than anything I have ever read.","You need a crime, a detective, and the solution.","As a child, I would demand that visitors to our house tell me a story. I was intensely interested in everything - still am.","My work is very carefully researched. Sometimes I have to ditch an idea because I can't prove it.","Unanswered questions make my head itch.","I'm a duty solicitor, so I can't fix someone's life; all I can do is fix the problem I've got in front of my eyes.","I have to write three books a year to make a reasonable living out of writing - unless, of course, she gets a major American film deal. Phryne has been optioned since the very first book, but to make a historical TV movie, it costs $30,000 a day extra for the historical detail to be correct, so most people aren't doing it.","I've always been in love with Melbourne. When I was 12, I was taken into the city by my grandmother to go to the ballet for the first time.","I decided that if I want to write about a female hero in the 1920s, I'm going to have to give her all the advantages I can because she has serious disadvantages in being a woman. I wasn't going to have her cowed or overawed by class, so she had to be titled.","I fell in love with words in all languages, and I read everything I could find, particularly myths and legends and histories and archeology and any novels.","I used to tell my three younger siblings stories because that was my household chore, and I told long stories in installments because it was easier and more fun than making up a new story every night. I loved it.","I went to a basic school, which had children from all corners of the world, and met my best friend and had to learn Greek because she didn't speak English.","Clothes were terribly important in the '20s. They really were an arbiter of who you were and how much money you had: an indicator of social status.","I didn't want to write a grown-up account of Gallipoli. I wanted to find out what would happen if I looked at Gallipoli through the eyes of an innocent.","If you look at the map, there's Thrace, Greece, Bulgaria, and there's tiny Gallipoli. It is such a small part of the whole peninsula, and yet you only hear about this little tiny bit.","I think it is rather heroic to go into a war zone where everyone is trying to kill you, and you have no way of shooting back.","I got out of difficult situations when many of my classmates didn't because I was smart, and I was lucky, and my parents were amazingly literate and helpful.","I was determined to become a criminal lawyer and help look after the poor.","In the 1970s, I used to buy opals and moonstones at the Queen Victoria Market, which were seen as old-fashioned and too heavy at the time.","Sometimes it's hard to start, but once it gets going, once you reach the tipping point - usually between chapter seven and nine - then it's like hanging onto a large snowball as it hurtles downhill.","I remember talking to John Mortimer, and he said he was relying on Rumpole to keep him in his old age; well, I'm doing the same with Phryne - she's my mainstay.","A publisher saw one of my historical novels and thought I would write an admirable detective story, so she offered me a two-book contract, and I grabbed it.","I have been reading crime books ever since I was a child, but I had never tried to write one.","When I first started writing the books in the 1980s, all of the female detectives were flawed in some way because they were based on noir characters.","I like writing books. I really love words. I love to read.","There's something magical about the idea that you can write something down and someone else can read it. I'm still mildly agog about that.","I don't think the process of writing books is in any way sensible. It's not logical, and it's not reasonable. I do write very fast, and I just do it in a binge. Other people binge-drink; I binge-write.","I research every possible bit of information I can find. Then I use about a tenth of it. But I have to know all the information first; otherwise, I'm not going to convince myself, and if I can't convince myself, then I'm not going to convince the reader.","There are only so many stories in the world... Duplication of plots is bound to happen because most writers have read very extensively in their genre and have become aware they are adding an extra layer to the meta-narrative, finding a new spin on the original.","Most detective story readers are an educated audience and know there are only a certain number of plots. The interest lies in what the writer does with them.","I don't steal stories. If I'm a plagiarist, so is Hitchcock. And Tolkien. And Shakespeare.","I liked the Ballarat train as a child."],"Kerry Healey":["Well, I think that abstinence has its place as part of a comprehensive health and sex education curriculum. It would be wrong to exclude abstinence from a health curriculum, because there are some potentially very serious ramifications for early sexual activity.","And Republican women have always been the backbone of our party. We do the work, we are strong believers in conservative values. Having more of those voices in place at a state level is going to be a great improvement for us as a party.","The press always causes a certain amount of hesitance for people who are considering entering public life. So simply encouraging women to enter politics, on any level, not just on the state level, is extremely important.","It's hard to think of anything that is more socially beneficial than raising children well. It needs to be valued and respected, I believe by everyone in public life regardless of your political party.","I don't think it's really good once you've lost an election to sit around, watch your former opponent, and swipe at them.","I think everyone knows how much of a joint effort being in politics is. It requires all kinds of sacrifices and all kinds of support.","As the daughter of a schoolteacher, I feel very strongly that the most important thing in school takes place right there in that classroom, and the interaction between the teacher and the child.","I want my kids to be in an environment where they can talk about values in a way that you can't always do in a public school setting.","Is Mitt Romney a bully? And the answer is, no... He does not have a vicious bone in his body.","I've learned that I don't need much sleep, and that I am able to really stand up for the things that I think that are important and that there are a lot of people out there who agree with me.","When Mitt Romney talks about women, when he says he believes that we can do any job a man can do, I know from experience that he's speaking from the heart."],"Kerry King":["If I'm ever feeling uninspired, all I have to do is go see Exodus or Arch Enemy, and think 'Oh yeah, that's what we're doing this for.'","My first figure was a SLAYER eagle. And the dragons and the tribals are all I have got.","My strangest media moment a photo session they all had dressed up like 50 gangsters. That was pretty cool. We have to get some more of those kind of photos sometimes.","I think no matter what kind of music you play, there will be moments when you feel like it's all been done before.","Traditionally the show must go on which is a stupid thing to say, but that in a nutshell is what's going on. We have a new record out; if we won't tour, the new record dies. It's reality - it's what business is nowadays. You just need to tour to sell your albums.","If you don't tour, you cannot expect to sell a huge numbers of your albums either. It was both a business - and an economical decision and we wanted to play anyway. We just wanted to get out for the tour when it was safe enough for us.","It's good to be playing one and a half hour again. In the States we played like an hour and when you got onstage it felt like all of a sudden you are already done your set. But now, it feels like we are touring again.","You kind of have to become a song so to speak and we wanted to make sure that Tom did them with the best abilities he had and captured all that what the song is all about.","Well, to be honest with you, yes there is and there is not. But as I am a fan of this kind of music as well as the rest of the guys naturally are - and being a fan, we kind of get pleased by our music as fans and as being in SLAYER.","Of course we are doing this primarily for ourselves, but I know our fans dig most of it, too.","This new one was held for a couple months, so I guess it was better, but when we go into thinking our next record tragedy, it traditionally will probably change the distribution again and it will get held up again.","We haven't played that many of them because all our gear was over here waiting for us when we could get here. So we didn't get to rehearse any of the new stuff, so we have planned to play 3 or 4 new ones.","I used the dictionary very minimally and I just wrote how I speak. And I speak very hateful manner usually. I constantly did that because I think the fans would get more out of it if they understood exactly what I'm saying - exactly where I'm coming from.","It's a new perspective where I got a role in and they are just spewed out of my mouth.","When something irritates me, I don't go home and write; I just don't do that.","I write when I have to; I write when the song is done and I deal with the idea and I just go with it and I'll become what that song is all about until I have finished it. And when you do that, it makes the song more visual, it makes it more personal.","It was only supposed to be on WCW compilation; on that wrestling compilation. And for that I thought it was good. And then we threw it on our record as well.","I just saw Jensen the other day. They are gonna be in the States at the same time when we are doing the tour, Se we'll see if we are going to see somewhere.","I think the church and the religion right now have a lot more to be worried about than SLAYER.","I play loud onstage for my own benefit as I like. But I'm not too fond of the P.A. either.","When we play 'Angel of Death', it's actually a 2 and half minutes sing 'til our party starts. That song is pretty much been played traditionally in the end.","It's hard 'coz you have got different time zones; you can't sleep and y'know, it's boring way for the show to happen, but you do off the stage. Y'know, onstage it's all better.","So, there's like one luxury you take and since we do that, y'know, you're involved with people in suits; business people all the time. But hey, if I sit down on a bar and they leave, good for me.","I'm always using a towel around my head. Airports don't worry about me.","Check bags are fun. I just make sure there won't be anything illegal in my check bag which is forbidden at a cabin of a plane. Just leaving things like scissors and such out of my carry-on things in order to avoid troubles with some certain airline, y'know.","When we finally got to play that and we had a great show there, well I can tell it was pretty awesome. Y'know, we probably did bigger festivals since then; we probably headlined bigger festivals since then, but I will always remember that.","The worst thing about touring is the travel.","It's fun when you are on tour to go a place you are familiar with in any given city. It's like being home away from home.","I remember when Circuit City was around, I never understood why people would shop there. I always thought Best Buy had a better selection and cheaper prices.","In the crazy world of touring, if something gets stuck at customs, I can do a show with just my amp!","I have tons of friends in the heavy-metal music world, and just going to see them inspires me.","I don't reflect much, unless I'm talking to the media. I have more of a 'Forward, march!' kind of attitude.","Chart numbers can be deceiving. An album doesn't have to sell that much these days to show up really high on the charts."],"Kerry Packer":["The good news is there's no devil. The bad news is there's no heaven. There's nothing.","I agree completely with my son James when he says 'Internet is like electricity. The latter lights up everything, while the former lights up knowledge'."],"Kerry Stokes":["Ethics or simple honesty is the building blocks upon which our whole society is based, and business is a part of our society, and it's integral to the practice of being able to conduct business, that you have a set of honest standards.","Every father loves their children. I love my two sons very dearly. The only thing that is important to me is that they do what they want to do. They shouldn't feel a sense of obligation.","I have a fear of public speaking. It's very hard work. Words are not my skill, and because they're not my skill, I have to work doubly hard.","You can choose a direction that will take you into something that isn't going to take you where you want to go, or you can choose another direction which is down the right pathway.","I'm lucky I had signposts in my life. At important times, I got pointed in the right direction by particular circumstances.","At one stage, I didn't have any money, so I slept on the streets for a few nights. It wasn't uncommon in the 1950s, and it wasn't uncommon to be out of money. There wasn't anywhere to go to get money.","I hate profile photos.","I know about photography - I'm really good at it.","I have always been comfortable that no one has been able to assess what I really have.","I ended up in Broadmeadows orphanage - I don't know how that happened - whether she gave me up for adoption or the church was responsible. Whatever happened, she was a single mum.","I just decided that I wasn't going to gain anything by going to school, since we couldn't afford it anyway, so I left school very early and went to work and progressively did things.","I'm a beginning, not an end.","You can be involved in media, and you can be involved in all the handbag hurling that goes along with it, and it's a different world.","With WesTrac, you have real people doing real jobs with real problems and real opportunities, and you touch the metal, and it's like being grounded.","I haven't got a problem with scrutiny. If it gets hot in the kitchen, don't cook a meal. People should be able to criticise us - it's completely appropriate.","I am a pretty tough nut, I guess, and I love art as one of the expressions that probably appeals to my softer side that a lot of people would deny I had.","Frankly, if you can sell something at $80 a tonne that cost you $20 a tonne, you might want to sell as much as you can.","Our balance sheet provides us with the ability to act on investment opportunities in appropriate areas that diversify and broaden our portfolio, including the gas and energy sector.","If you have a difficult message to deliver in any circumstance, it's always best to do it first up-front, and probably be a bit harder than you have to be because it's always easier to be nicer afterwards.","If you have a difficult marriage, it's the hard times that make it better. If you have a relationship, it's the hard times that actually make it better, and that goes for life as well.","I don't wish hardship on anybody. My background was one of being very difficult, very hard, and they were subject to the times I lived in. I wouldn't wish that on anybody.","I've been very lucky because Perth has been very good to me. I've enjoyed my journey and met so many wonderful people.","I love Perth. It is my home, and no matter where I am in the world, Perth is where my heart is."],"Kerry Thornley":["What we imagine is order is merely the prevailing form of chaos.","If organized religion is the opium of the masses, then disorganized religion is the marijuana of the lunatic fringe.","Although a madman, Norton wrote letters to Abraham Lincoln and Queen Victoria which they took seriously.","As for the Devil - that is somebody our religion tried to do without for a long time.","Every few thousand years some shepard inhales smoke from a burning bush and has a vision or eats moldy rye bread in a cave and sees God.","Organized religion preaches Order and Love but spawns Chaos and Fury. Why?"],"Kerry Washington":["I think every girl should have a tailor in her phone. It's part of why we beat ourselves up, or why shopping is so frustrating and hard: we have this assumption that when you take something off the rack, it will fit you.","For me, what is political is very personal. Politics are not this abstract idea. Laws are the rules that dictate how we live our lives. What we eat is political. How we dress is political. Where we live is political. All of these things are influenced by political decision-making, and it's important to be part of the process.","The breakdown of the black community, in order to maintain slavery, began with the breakdown of the black family. Men and women were not legally allowed to get married because you couldn't have that kind of love. It might get in the way of the economics of slavery. Your children could be taken from you and literally sold down the river.","I think sometimes in life we want to ignore the problems of society and just think about the good. I believe in positive thinking and affirmative living, I also think it's really important to remember all of our disenfranchised members of society.","Today there are people trying to take away rights that our mothers, grandmothers and great-grandmothers fought for: our right to vote, our right to choose, affordable quality education, equal pay, access to health care. We the people can't let that happen.","I would wear pajamas to work every day if it were up to me.","Being the one woman in the room should not be seen as a victory. If there's only one of us in the room, we're still a token; we don't actually have an empowered voice. If there's two of us, we're still a minority. If there's three, then we're allowed to have a multiplicity of opinions.","I bring something to the table as a woman; I bring something to the table as a woman of color.","I'm here not just as an actress but as a woman, an African-American, a granddaughter of Ellis Island immigrants, a person who could not have afforded college without the help of student loans and as one of millions of volunteers working to re-elect President Obama!","I think as more women are in positions of power, more people of color are in positions of power, the stories become more inclusive; the casts become more inclusive.","There are a lot of forms of exercise where you have to leave yourself out of the room while you force yourself to do this thing. With Pilates, I get to bring my true self. I cry, I laugh. I get to go, 'Where is my body today? What do I need today? How can I take care of myself and push myself past my comfort zone?'","I think most people, when they think about the Black Panther Party, they think in very abstract, caricatured terms. They think about black fists in the air, but they don't think about the actual people, and the families, and the relationships.","I don't think I consciously say, 'What would Olivia Pope do?' but there's a new thread of belief in my own capacity that I think comes from her. She makes it happen. She figures it out. She fixes it.","When I read 'Ray' for the first time, I had just quit. When I read 'The Last King of Scotland,' I had just quit. I hadn't quite quit when I read 'Scandal,' but I was feeling really unfulfilled as an actor.","I didn't grow up thinking I was pretty; there was always a prettier girl than me. So I learned to be smart and tried to be funny and develop the inside of me, because I felt like that's what I had.","I come from film, where I only play a character for three months at a time, and then it's done, so it's important for me to be able to put on other hats and make sure that all of the tools in my toolbox that don't apply to Olivia Pope are still in shape.","I wouldn't just come home from school and watch TV everyday, they had me involved in lots of local theatre. I was a very dramatic, talkative child. And that was part of my mother's creative solution - to put me in workshops and classes and children's theatre programmes.","I really gravitate toward having all different styles in my closet because I feel like I always want to dress to fit my mood or where I am going. I do love Jason Wu; he is also a really good friend of mine, and I love what he is doing for Hugo Boss these days.","I have to take care of myself in order to live life the way I want to. It's important to have rest days. But in the long run, if I don't work out for, like, three days, I feel worse, not better.","You may not be thinking about politics, but politics is thinking about you.","I am co-writing a screenplay now and I'm working on the rights to another story I want to do. So I plan to produce and direct. So, for me, I don't really feel that I am vulnerable to that sad baggage that comes with the business of filmmaking.","I think generalizations of any sort are dangerous. I'll say, if that is the case - right now it's an American issue.","When I think about any of the missteps in my life that I've made, all of which I'm grateful for, it's because I just so wanted to be truly seen and heard for who I am and was afraid I wasn't or wouldn't be.","I choose to feel optimistic, because I don't think I could get out of bed if I didn't.","I was really lucky because I went to an all-girl school, and that single-sex education really helped me because I really learned to bond with women and to not compete with or compare myself as much because we were all allowed to be ourselves and be unique and kind of have our unique strengths.","When you buy into the cultural idea of what's acceptable and unacceptable, you reinforce negative stereotypes and prejudices. That wouldn't work for me. I don't love to give advice to anyone, because we all have to make our own choices, but I'd want to live my life in truth.","I like how people will post pictures of me with other women that I adore, hugging on red carpets, and say, 'See?' Are we so uncomfortable with love between two people of the same gender that we immediately label it as sexual? But I've never been bothered by the lesbian rumor. There's nothing offensive about it, so there's no reason to be offended.","So many struggled so that all of us could have a voice in this great democracy and live up to the first three words of our constitution: We the people. I love that phrase so much. Throughout our country's history, we've expanded the meaning of that phrase to include more and more of us. That's what it means to move forward.","I don't think I'm even close to fulfilling my potential. And I think also that, unlike a pianist or a flutist, an actor has an instrument that is constantly changing.","That's what acting is - it's about... having the courage to allow your audience into the private moments of your characters' lives.","I always prided myself on the fact that I could live out of milk crates forever. It was kind of my way of detaching from materialism.","You see the transformation that the arts have on young people. It changes their lives for the better. That's where my engagement is.","Making the unbelievable believable is different on a set with 'Fantastic Four,' where it's like, 'Wind machines! Because the airship is coming in and you're pretending to be afraid!'","I'm doing this play right now, the new David Mamet play. It's called 'Race,' and it's very interesting how people really leave the theater filled with the desire to talk about the play and the issues and the characters, and how they're all navigating their personal views around race.","I feel like any single woman of color who's been onstage has a Shakespeare monologue in her back pocket, and a monologue from 'For Colored Girls.' It's just part of what you should have, as a woman of color.","I grew up in New York, so I fell in love with acting on a stage, not in front of a camera.","You know what's funny is that I have this ongoing relationship with the city of Washington D.C. I went to George Washington University, and my nickname was K-Dub - based on G-Dub - and I'm now on the board of trustees at George Washington University.","I come from the theater and I plan to always do theater. So I don't really see myself not being able to act even if people don't think I am sexy enough for film at 40, I'll still be acting.","I've always been a writer because I've always been a student. My mom's a retired professor, so I come from a very academic background. I love writing, you know?","About a year ago I got really exhausted from reading bad scripts and I know that I am a writer and that I have stories to tell, so I thought, 'Let's do this!' So I'm co-writing a screenplay now with another screenwriter and loving it. Absolutely loving it. And I would like to be the producer on the project and of course the lead is me.","I really love research. It's one of the things I love most about my job. I feel like it's me in the lab cooking up the character.","Every actor you work with has a different method, same with the director. You have to figure out what your shared language is and how to best support each other, and also take care of yourself.","As a young girl, my real dream was to be the woman in the shows at SeaWorld.","People don't think about the fact that when Barack Obama's parents had him - it was illegal for them to be married in several states in this country. So if we start making it okay that certain people can marry and other people can't, it's a slippery slope of civil rights. Who knows who is going to be allowed to marry or not marry next.","I think as a whole America is dealing with the issue of homophobia. We got to be really honest about whether we believe in civil rights for all people or not. As Black people we need to remember the moment that we say it's okay to disenfranchise one segment of society, we're opening the door to move backward on ourselves.","I'm a person who's always been politically active and passionate about people's rights.","Earlier in my career, I was much more super-sharey. There were moments when I wanted to process things that were happening to me more privately, and I didn't have the space to do it, because once you let people in, they're in, and you don't get to say, 'Oh, I want this for myself.'","I'm always working. My cousins call me the longshoreman of actors.","I really try to let my friends into all of my life. They know that Red-Carpet Kerry is a version of Kerry, and they know that DNC Speaker Kerry is me.","I learned through experience that it doesn't work for me to talk about my personal life. I've had earlier times in my career when I did talk about it.","I have girlfriends in this business who talk about their personal lives, and it works for them, and I love it. But not for me.","If I were somebody who spent the majority of my time saying things that were harsh and difficult to hear, I would want my visual aesthetic to be something soft and feminine, warm and easy to be around.","I have to make sure that I don't silence myself about the things that I believe in, because sometimes the fear creeps in of 'What if fewer people watch the show or fewer people hire me because I express my politics?' For me, the commitment is to never be quiet just because I'm in the public eye.","Before 'Scandal,' I was actually cast in two other pilots. Both went to series, but I was fired and recast. For both, it was because they wanted me to sound more 'girlfriend,' more like 'hood,' more 'urban.'","I've had friends of mine say, like, they're tired of 'gayface,' and I was like, 'What's gayface?' They were like, 'It's the gay version of blackface: like, come in and be more effeminate.'","I definitely feel like I'm at that point where it's nice to not have to sit at home and wait to be invited to the party, but to be creating work for yourself.","My mother is one of seven kids, so I have a lot of strong women in my family, and I have supportive, beautiful relationships with all of them.","I don't want to not be African. The goal is to live in a world where my race doesn't limit my access, where I can see myself represented in the highest level of society without any limitation.","One of the most amazing things about my job is that I have arguably, maybe not even arguably - definitively - the best boss on the planet. Shonda Rhimes is the best.","Shoes define how you walk in the world and how you stand: like, what is your posture in life?","For the red carpet, I'm totally a stiletto girl. But in the rest of my life, I'd say I'm 50/50. I love a good heel, but I also have a really great sneaker collection. That's the Bronx girl in me.","I guess because I came to it later in life, I realized, 'Oh, going to a fashion show is like going to the opening of Degas at the Met or going to see Swan Lake.'","It's interesting how much people long to fill in the gaps when someone in the public eye doesn't share their personal life. I understand their frustration.","I always felt like my value was much more in my intellect than it was in my appearance, and so that's what I spent time cultivating. And some of that I get from my mother, some of that comes from the schools that I went to, and some of that comes from probably insecurity.","I've been wanting to produce for some time because I want to have more creative control over the things that I do and not be victim to the whims of other people's desires.","I just really love producing. I love being able to be part of a solution. I love being able to create opportunities for other people to do what they do, to be part of the collaborative process that is filmmaking and television making.","I have an amazing social media manager, Allison Peters, who is one of my closest friends since childhood.","I come from a family with a really strong work ethic - not just my parents, but my aunts, uncles and cousins. It rubbed off on me. I have a cousin in The Bronx who says I'm like the longshoreman of actors. I am a worker.","I don't talk about my personal life in the press; that's how I kept my wedding a secret.","I've never been comfortable being a pawn. I work with brands where I feel like I can have my say and companies that I'm proud to be in a relationship with. Partnerships take a lot of time. If I am going to put my name and my face and my energy behind something, I want it to be authentic.","I think Calvin is so beautiful. Oscar De La Renta is so classic. I really like the Rodarte girl; they are super-inventive, and they think outside the box. I am all over the place!","When you have things that are very important to you in life, when there are things you want to do and be - that takes work. It takes work to show up for your own story and show up for the dream and vision you have for yourself."],"Kesha Rogers":["I'm a Democrat because I represent the true traditions of the Democratic Party.","We know that the next several generations need a better world to live in, which can only be a post-Obama World.","Barack Obama is a threat to the continued existence of the United States, and he must be impeached, or resign.","Texas Democrats should be more concerned about what President Obama is doing to destroy the party, and the nation, than about what I am doing in going after him for that.","What made me decide to run was the dire state of the economy and the non-leadership of President Obama. At that point in time, my campaign put a mustache on Obama as part of the national campaign drive.","If Obama commits thermonuclear war, I won't have to worry about November and neither will you.","In 2010 and 2012, I won the Democratic nomination in the 22nd Congressional District on the program 'Save NASA Impeach Obama,' without any organizational or financial backing from the party.","Make no mistake: Obamacare is a pro-death 'health' program.","After graduating college in 2001 with a B. A. in Political Science and Speech Communications from Texas State University - San Marcos, I realized that my generation and those younger had been given no future and had been maliciously robbed of the knowledge of principles and methods necessary for building one.","One of the most beautiful things that recruited me to join the LaRouche movement is its emphasis on Classical singing and composition, especially with the Negro Spirituals, adding a new depth of profundity to songs I had sang while growing up."],"Kesha":["I believe in karma, and I believe if you put out positive vibes to everybody, that's all you're going to get back.","Be yourself. Unapologetically.","I deal with haters on a daily basis.","Just because I'm sassy and have a mouth on me doesn't mean I'm coming from a negative place.","I have rock 'n' roll pumping through my veins.","You don't have to carry a designer bag that costs more than a car to look cool.","When you're around me, you're going to get glitter on you.","You really can't stereotype people or put them in boxes, it's unfair.","I embrace the imperfections and celebrate them.","I am a huge fan of the transgender community.","Working in this industry, I have been exposed to so many products and now realize more than ever how cruel and unnecessary animal testing is.","Glitter is my makeup of choice.","Eventually, I would love to be on my deathbed and looked at as an icon. Right now I'm still at the baby stages of my career. But that is the goal.","I'm not saying I'm the perfect role model. But I'm honest. Period.","I do have a stylist who helps me shop, because I don't have time to shop.","There is no correlation between happiness and amounts of money.","Of course there are certain things that get to me, but I try and lead by example and show people that, especially with haters, that you should just ignore them.","I went through awkward, chubby, total weirdo phases.","A friend of mine has a big farm in the desert, and she picks up feathers and roadkill for me, then makes it into clothes. I think it's cool to wear roadkill. If I died and somebody wanted to wear my teeth around their neck to VMAs, I'd feel honored.","Every weird thing about you is beautiful and makes life interesting.","You're an animal, you live, maybe this one time is your lifetime - go there. Who cares what somebody else thinks?","I like vintage a lot.","I have haters. I have so many haters.","One fan sent me one tooth, so I made a necklace out of it. But then I found a bunch of my baby teeth, and started realizing I would love to wear a piece of my fans' bodies on me.","I was very studious.","My makeup is usually left over from the night before.","It's about time that society accepts people for who they are.","I do think I have a rebellious, metal-loving rock chick inside of me.","I'm pretty sure that I was JFK in my past life.","I love it when people send me body parts.","I don't really plan what comes out of my mouth, and that's what makes most of my lyrics entertaining.","I wanted to make youthful, irreverent anthems. Parents might not get it, but kids would.","I think I am really irreverent and I pretty much just talk to and about men the way men talk to and about women.","What I'm bringing to the pop table is that I'm not pretentious.","You have to have a sense of humor about life to get through it.","I write about what I'm going through.","I understand I'm supposed to be feminine and dainty, but I'm not. There are two sides to the coin. People are more impressed with things that I do because they almost treat you as if you're handicapped if you're a woman... people can be impressed that I can play a few chords on the guitar.","My music is fun, kind of cheeky.","My mother taught me how to write.","I put on the best live show, the absolute best live show I can possibly can.","I'm not saying I look cool, but every single time I go onstage, it is a fail if I don't feel like I'm going to pass out at least twice.","Society has taught us to suppress certain things and not do certain things.","I don't get embarrassed.","I don't wear a lot of high heels.","I think there's a good pop song in pretty much anything.","I've always been loud and obnoxious and sneaking my way into things, and so I feel like I've snuck my way onto the Lollapalooza lineup, and I'm going to sneak my way into whatever else I get to do.","I think people need to have fun with whatever they're doing - makeup, their clothes, music, live shows - anything you don't need to take too seriously, don't take too seriously.","My band and I, we cover our bodies in hairspray and glitter. We use the hairspray to make sure the glitter sticks.","I can't walk in high heels, never mind dance in them.","I don't go to clubs.","I'm responsible.","I wouldn't have a No. 1 record or song if I wasn't a hardworking person.","It can bum you out when your intentions aren't, like, translated properly.","I grew up in the Bible Belt and I made my own clothes and dyed my hair purple. Nobody ever knew what to do with me.","All men that date me have to know that their name may end up in a pop song.","I hope to bring much more attention to important issues and change for issues and practices that are harming animals.","What I'm doing is art - it's low-brow art but there's a magic in that.","You never know what an artist is going to create next.","Writing for somebody else is really fun 'cause I consider myself a songwriter first and foremost.","I've done the country, done the pop-rock, done the super-hard electro.","I'm not thuggy.","If you want to be a legitimate artist, it's more important what you say no to.","Rap in general has never been my steez, but I like it.","I don't have the best body in the world, but I know for a fact that I have a really good voice.","I'm really fun. I'm ridiculously fun. I hope I'm infectiously fun.","I played saxophone and trumpet. Pretty nerdy.","I'm a singer and a writer first. I started to rap by accident, being playful.","I do love country music.","I love country music, blues, and punk, and one day I might make those kinds of records.","I'm writing constantly about all my crazy experiences across the world, so I have a lot of music I've already written.","I've always been into bearded dudes.","I'm over dudes trying to look like they're in boy bands.","I plan on making a lot more records, and hopefully one of them will be Grammy worthy.","Everything I write is based on something I've personally experienced, or things that my friends have experienced that I just find horribly entertaining.","I love creepy old dudes. I love that they have so much self-confidence, despite having no evidence whatsoever to back it up.","I'm just very amused by five-year-old humor.","I write about stuff that happens to me, so I try to live as interesting a life as possible.","I want to reconnect to my animal life.","My show is a sensory assault... in a very brief manner - the show is only 25 minutes long.","I try to get in quiet time and book time, but really, the only time I ever get that is when I'm on an airplane - I have a fear of flying, but I actually love flying because it's the only time I can sleep, and it's the only time I get to read.","I never want to be pretentious.","I want a pig. I want a pig on a leash. A baby pig on a leash.","I do my laundry on a weekly basis.","I am so not a proper, good female. I can't dance in high heels and I'm just so not girly, but then I see these men with these banging bodies, dancing in heels, singing, and having so much fun with so much make-up on. That makes me honestly want to be a better woman.","I just think that gay men have much better taste than any straight man I have met. I have never gotten any grief about having a good time, being unapologetic, and irreverent from a gay man.","I think people should give in to what they feel like doing at the time and be a raw animal.","I think if you are going to be a singer, you should sing. If you are going to be a dancer, you should dance. If you are going to do a combination of the two, you should make it very clear when you are singing and very clear when you are dancing.","Sometimes it is hard to sing and dance at the same time, but I would rather be off and be real and genuine about it to my fans.","I don't want to treat my fans like they are stupid.","I do destroy men on a weekly basis. It's like a hobby. I'm like a praying mantis.","I know that I can sing. That's the reason I started playing music when I was twelve years old.","I could party in a cardboard box with people who are funny and don't care. For me, it's really about who I surround myself with, so I just try to always be with hilarious people.","I just like playing with makeup and clothes - so I really don't feel like there are rules, and if there are rules, then I think it's up to you to break them.","I don't want young people to think they can't make a difference because they don't have money.","I love wearing the exact same thing all the time because I think it makes you like a cartoon character. They always wear the same outfit and everybody always remembers them for it, so I feel like I should do the same thing.","It is so fascinating that someone can commit their whole entire lifestyle to being such a fantastic woman when I'm such a bum about it."],"Keshia Knight Pulliam":["Everyone has their own different life experiences which make them who they are. No two people's life experiences are the same. And mine are just unique to me.","I don't know if there is a 'lack' of good black men. But when you haven't taken the time to get to know yourself, be OK with you, and articulate what it is you want in a relationship, then you can't possibly find that person for you because you don't even know what you're looking for.","If Janet Jackson does the story of her life and I'm still young enough, I am there. No one can pull her off like I can. I have a dance background. I'm definitely not cutting an album anytime soon, but I can lip-synch all day. I can't sing, but I can act like it very well.","A fabulous pair of shoes? I have to have willpower.","To me, it's about good work, a good story, and tastefully done. There's so many stigmas - oh, you're on the small screen or you do films or you do reality. It's about the project and not the medium on which it's delivered. It's the story you tell, period.","I've never gone to culinary school, but I do love cooking.","I'd rather laugh - not fuss and fight. You can articulate your point without arguing. When you're arguing constantly, you just need to say, 'You're real cool, but you're not for me.'","Honestly, I just try to live right, get enough sleep, and drink a lot of water. I do drink a lot of water; I do live by that. And just eating good clean food... I do love all of it. But I do definitely try to eat better organic food.","My parents and my family really tried to maintain as much of a normal environment as possible. When I went home, it wasn't Keshia Knight Pulliam the actress, the glitz, the glamour. It was Keshia the daughter. Oldest of four children, who washed the dishes and did everything she was supposed to do.","I would love to be remembered as a wonderfully dynamic and multitalented actress who left a legacy through her work and through her life of helping people and of being a positive force in the world.","I love watching the National Geographic channel. That show 'Taboo'? I love it!","'The Cosby Show' - no one thought there's doctors and lawyers who are married and live in brownstones! Back then no one would have thought we would have an African-American president. They would have laughed in your face.","I definitely try to live my life in a very fearless manner, but there are no other sports that you jump from a three-story building and land on your hands! Diving is a lot like life. You just have to trust in what you know and allow it to happen.","What people forget is that I'm an actress. That's the wonderful thing about what I do. I get to play different roles.","I like the joy when you feed people and they're happy and full and enjoying themselves.","Once you know the fundamentals of cooking, then you don't need to follow a recipe - you just know what herbs go well or what meats, or what combination of what goes together, and then you can just branch out from there. But if there's something specific that I want to make, I work on the recipe and tweak it to my own.","I would definitely be interested in doing a cooking show or something related to cooking, and I think probably most immediately, I would do a cookbook.","I'm single, and I hate dating.","I don't live in L.A. I actually live in Atlanta, Georgia. After I graduated from Spelman, I just stayed and never left. And I love it.","'Paper Planes' by M.I.A. is very catchy. I like that, but I listen to everything from rap to Lenny Kravitz to Coldplay, depending on my mood. And my favorite song of all time is 'Always and Forever' by Heatwave.","My mom didn't believe in putting chemicals in hair. But when I got to college, we didn't have A/C in our dorms freshman year. So after several days of waking up looking like a Chia Pet, I was like 'OK, I'm gonna get a perm.' And then my hair revolted and fell out. I was over that quick, fast and in a hurry.","I think Mr. Cosby has always been very much an activist and a big proponent of African-American pride. That's how 'The Cosby Show' came about. I think in his older years, he has gotten a lot more direct and vocal about it. But I think he only wants the best for all of us.","The stories on 'The Cosby Show' transcend time.","If my skin is feeling a little dry, I use La Mer face cream. I also love their Eye Concentrate. It goes on with this little metal ball thing that's very refreshing.","I love Dior products. They have this Capture Totale One Essential Skin Boosting Super Serum that gives you fresh, glowing, dewy skin.","On my body, I use Kai body butter. It smells really nice and it's fresh and creamy. When it's really cold out, I go with some good ol' Nivea cream.","Girls will go out and spend $200 or $300 dollars on a pair of shoes, but you should also be taking care of your skin. That's the first thing people see. I think it's an investment. It's a lot cheaper to use really great products now, rather than trying to fix problematic skin later on in life. That's always been my motto.","The funny thing is, people only know me for having straight hair for work, but I live in Atlanta where it's hot and humid in the summertime. So when I'm home, I wear my hair natural. My hair is naturally curly; I don't have a relaxer.","No matter what your hair looks like once it's wet, it's about embracing it and loving yourself for you and all that that entails.","As a black woman trying different products and figuring out what works best for me, the one thing that I realized is that hair brands lump us together as having 'black hair,' but all black hair is not alike.","I try to eat good; I really do. It's really about moderation.","I don't understand anorexia; I'm too greedy to ever not eat... I just can't do it."],"Kether Donohue":["I remember watching 'I Love Lucy' with my little brother. We were obsessed with 'I Love Lucy.' And I just remember thinking, 'I want to do that.' I love old comedic actresses - Madeline Kahn, Lucille Ball.","When I go into 'You're the Worst,' I'm very glammed up, and my hair and makeup is va-va-voom. Now what I'm having fun with in 'Grease' is, honestly, I go to rehearsals with zero makeup. When I get pimples, I get excited about it, like 'Yay! It helps the character!' The frumpier and uglier and grosser, the better with Jan.","When people see a Spanish last name, they have an image in their head of what the typical Latina looks like. I think it's important on television to have different representations of people. And I'm so proud of being Latina. I love it.","As a feminist, just to speak to what women go through, I think women are put in a box way too often. What I love about 'You're the Worst' is that no female character is portrayed as a black-and-white cartoon character. We're all complicated, messy human beings.","I kind of wanted to be a waitress in New York City. I thought it was fun and glamorous in its own way. Like in the movie 'Beaches,' when Bette Midler is banging on the radiator, and it's cold, and she's poor. I kind of thought that would be fun to be, like, a poor, struggling actor.","In real everyday life, I don't walk around feeling fat, and if on TV I'm considered fat, honestly, I kind of like it, because I'm a big advocate of positive unique representations of women in media. And so I like how I'm able to represent a curvier body and still be beautiful.","I love playing a character that eats on television. It's so fun.","I'm very into Zodiac signs, so when I meet a fellow Scorpio, I always get really excited.","When you watch someone on TV go through something that you're going through that's difficult, it lets you know that you're not alone, and there's nothing to be ashamed of.","I'm short, and I'm curvy, and so shopping is hard for me sometimes.","Sometimes I catch myself if I'm shopping, and I'm like, 'I want to hide my thighs and my arms.' And then I kind of take a minute where I'm like, 'No, that's not really being kind to yourself. Maybe learn to embrace things that we're taught as women not to like.'","We're taught as a society what is acceptable for women to look like and what's not. And where fat should be and shouldn't. And I think it's important to sometimes reprogram ourselves and recondition ourselves to not have so much negativity toward our own bodies.","My father was born and raised in Havana, Cuba. His family is from Spain. My father never taught me how to speak Spanish when I was little. That's very disappointing to me. I'm still planning on learning it on my own. I really want to travel to Spain and immerse myself in the culture and learn it on my own.","I've experienced, in general, in New York, people cut to the chase a little more, and they're a little bit more straightforward. In L.A. I've experienced more wishy-washiness. I will say, though, that the people that are actually from L.A. - like, born and raised in L.A. - are the real nice and genuine people.","When I go to audition for voiceovers, I do dress as if I'm going to an on-camera audition because that's my way of showing that I do care and it means something to me.","I've done commercials that Sam Mendes directed. Paul Feig directed me in a commercial.","I've been auditioning since I'm nine years old. Honestly, most of my friends I've met in audition rooms because you're always auditioning.","All four of the actors in 'You're the Worst,' we all have strong theater backgrounds. We all play off of each other in that way that you would in theater. You kind of are up for anything out of the blue happening and getting it on film, you know? We're all just open to playing.","One of my favorite movies as a kid was 'Mrs. Doubtfire.'"],"Kevin A. Ford":["I made about fifty-four dollars a week and spent it on two flying lessons every week at the age of sixteen and was able to get a license then pretty early and knew that that's what I wanted to do, some kind of a career in aviation. I did know about space flight, but at that point, it was still pretty far out there.","It's amazing to see the Earth in its glory down there.","Space is dark but, of course, when we're on the sun side of the Earth, we're in full illumination and we have all the reflection of the Earth below us, beautiful blue Earth and we're in daylight. Only on the back side, opposite side of the sun, it seems like night to us, too.","Life as an astronaut in space is a very interesting one. There are things we all take for granted here on earth, like gravity, that can make things a bit challenging. One of the fun things about getting here is the zero gravity and floating around. But it also makes things very difficult.","I took a Russian class at Notre Dame. Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would fly someday in a Russian spacecraft with two cosmonauts, speaking only Russian.","I think if I had to choose, I would rather have gravity instead of zero gravity. It's fun for a while, but I'd rather live on Earth.","It's much easier for me to sleep in space than it is back home. We sleep in a cabin, and you can float inside.","We spend our spare time taking care of little things. I can watch a little bit of college and professional football if I want to... Our favorite pastime is trying to take pictures of our hometowns from space.","When the guys come back in from the spacewalk, there really is a distinct smell of space; it's something I will never forget.","A lot of scientists on Earth think of things that they could do in zero g. Things like the way metals cure, for example, and the way fluids react in space can tell us a lot about some of the unknowns we have on Earth.","Anytime I float by a window, I can tell whether the outside is lit or if it's dark outside. When we're working it's just day for us with the lights on inside.","Well, the coolest thing I have seen so far, in terms of, like, me being an astronaut and seeing something unusual, was the rendezvous, the docking of a Progress spaceship.","My first inclination was toward flying and being a pilot.","The ability of the humans to not only function in space but be very functional when they arrive at their destination, those are the kinds of things we're learning from the science. Fuel transfer technologies and all the things we can learn about the space environment are all valuable to us for pressing on out.","I grew up in Montpelier, Indiana. It's a little town in the northeast corner of Indiana. It's a rural community; about two thousand people, a very much hometown U.S.A. kind of thing.","I enjoy going out to the plants, the factories where just some sub-element maybe of the orbiter or the space station is built. Those people take such pride in that component, and they build it to perfection, and it's just a pleasure to see that.","Space station is, it really is one of the more, if not the most, impressive technological achievement of the modern day, not only in what we've accomplished engineering-wise but what we've accomplished on this international scale, because anybody will tell you that half the challenge is making it all work.","I think someday, out in space, perhaps, some people might be able to grow some of their own food or hopefully on another planet.","One of the things I do know is we know very little about our universe. Even though we think we know a lot, and we do know a lot more than we used to, we have a lot to learn about our universe."],"Kevin Alejandro":["I absolutely love spending time with my family.","I want to do all kinds of things. I want to do some comedy. I'd love to do a romantic comedy, and I'd love to do some period pieces with classical text. I'd love somebody to cast me as Macbeth, but for a film. I just want to be all over the place."],"Kevin Ayers":["I think that the basic philosophy was very good. It was just be nice to each other, and don't step on other people's toes and infringe on their freedom.","These were all middle-class kids from literary backgrounds, joining this sort of train going by, this pop train, jumping on. Whereas the rest of the rock scene, you'll find that there's mostly working-class people.","England is so defined, the class system, your education. I think what was unique about the Canterbury scene.","That was something. As opposed to nothing.","We had literary references, so we knew what we were talking about. We could quote things, talk about books we'd read; you can say something, you don't have to explain it.","The music we made then was so amateurish, compared to the rest of mainstream pop or rock and roll. But what differentiated us from what everybody else was doing in the business was the fact that you could tell that these people came from different reference areas.","I can't write songs unless I am in love.","If I am not in love, nothing is meaningful to me. I have no energy.","Honestly, I just assume that whatever is going to happen to me is going to happen. There it goes: someone is there, someone isn't there. This girl is here. This food is here. I think the clever people are the ones who do a little as possible.","The thing about 'Soft Machine' and me was that I never considered another profession."],"Kevin Bacon":["A good director creates an environment, which gives the actor the encouragement to fly.","Part of being a man is learning to take responsibility for your successes and for your failures. You can't go blaming others or being jealous. Seeing somebody else's success as your failure is a cancerous way to live.","We are being choked to death by the amount of plastic that we throw away. It's killing our oceans. It's entering into our bodies in the fish we eat.","One of the top comments I get from people is, 'Oh my God, you're like a regular person!' That's kind of a bizarre thing to live with. I know a lot of famous people, and their lives may not be regular, but they are regular people.","I really believe that all of us have a lot of darkness in our souls. Anger, rage, fear, sadness. I don't think that's only reserved for people who have horrible upbringings. I think it really exists and is part of the human condition. I think in the course of your life you figure out ways to deal with that.","I have a natural swagger.","The greats are 'The Shining', 'Rosemary's Baby', 'Don't Look Now', 'The Exorcist' - those movies were not really slashers: they were about psychological terror and had very deep emotional backdrops. If we do our best, '6 Miranda Drive' can be that kind of a movie.","Here's the thing - I mean, I don't act for statues. I really don't. The great thing about winning an award is that it creates opportunities.","It does get old to have to always be a monkey in a zoo. I don't know what it's like any more to be anonymous.","'Animal House' was my first movie, so I didn't have anything to compare it to. I was a sight gag more than anything else. So I can't say it was one of those things where your life changes. When the movie came out, I had to ask for the night off at the bar.","I'm obsessed with zombies. I like watching zombie movies and I read zombie books.","When I go home, I try to raise my children with honesty and integrity and teach them to take care of the world and of each other.","I'm an actor. It's what I do. It's what I chose to do with my life when I was a little boy, and that's what Im still doing. I like to work. I came up with a work ethic, and that's just what I do.","I do struggle with how much and in which way, as an artist or celebrity, that you voice your political views.","There's the most resistance to an actor singing. It's like I'm being disloyal to my industry.","I think one of the most pervasive evils in this world is greed and acquiring money for money's sake. Once you have six houses and a plane, it's just about a number. It's never been anything I understood.","I've played a lot of bad guys, and I'm pretty good at leaving my work at the office. And I look at acting as having a certain sort of therapeutic nature to it.","I always have a suitcase ready to go. My wife and I are both very much like this. We're both vagabonds, and we have been since the time we were married.","'Kung Fury!' I mean, Jesus, that thing is amazing.","People work so hard, and I want to keep that energy up, and you can spread that if you're the actor. But I'm also not able to turn it on and off like a faucet. A lot of what I'm called upon to play is violent or angry. When I'm messing around with the crew and making jokes, I remember, 'Oh, this is the guy I normally am.'","Certainly, network television in general relies a little bit too much on keeping people focused and emotional and scared and pushing the envelope by building wall-to-wall music.","There's this American dream to put enough away that you can golf and build a birdhouse or just be in a Barcalounger watching football all day. I'll never be that guy. And I'm not really sure the people who have that are all that happy. Our desires as a man are to work, plow ahead, and overcome conflict.","I would say invisibility would be sort of a fun power to have just to see what it was like to move through the world and not be looked at.","I'd love to be a pop idol. Of course, my groupies are now between 40 and 50.","Any idiot can get laid when they're famous. That's easy. It's getting laid when you're not famous that takes some talent.","As I was coming up on the stage, there was one source that could make or break you, the New York Times. Inevitably there would be one actor singled out for a better review, or worse, than somebody else. The effect of that was cancerous, divisive.","Before Footloose, the things I'd done weren't cute. In Diner I was an alcoholic.","Clint Eastwood has always been a hero.","Critics can be your most important friend. I don't read criticism of my stuff only because when it's bad, it's rough-and when it's good, it's not good enough.","Gary Oldman is impossible to steal a movie from. He's such a great actor, he's off the hook. I love him.","I always wanted, and still aspire, to be something more than just one thing, just one performance.","I didn't get into this so I could talk about my work, my movies. You become an actor to act.","I do better on the first three takes; I won't be better at 20 takes.","I don't have to do the lead. If I dig a part, I'll do it.","I don't read my own reviews and I haven't for probably 15 years. I read other people's reviews, though.","I don't want to stop acting, but acting in some ways is a young man's game.","I just let the work speak for itself. An actor is not afraid to take risks; to put on different hats; to be a good guy, a bad guy, a victim, an abuser. There are all kinds of people in the world, and playing them is what acting is all about.","I like directing. It takes a lot out of you, but I'd like to do it again - I just have to find a story I want to tell.","I think we all have a lot of darkness in our bellies. As an actor, the challenge of tapping into that, reaching down into that sadness or anger, is very therapeutic.","I'd always tried not to worry about the size of the role or the size of the film.","I'd really like to get the girl, shoot the gun, drive the car, have fun. I even have these kind of action dreams, where I'm the action guy.","I'm always happier and a better actor when I can really lose myself in a character and become somebody else.","I've made three studio albums and one live one with my brother. It's melodic singer-songwriter acoustic-rock music.","If I'm in a situation where someone doesn't recognize me and treats me like everyone else, I'm not used to it.","If you're an actor, even a successful one, you're still waiting for the phone to ring.","L.A. kind of scares me.","Ninety-five percent of celebrity is good.","The business that people do in LA on the social level is amazing. You go to a restaurant, bump into this guy or that guy. The next day you get a call, and they want you in their movie.","There are people who tell you to shut up because you're just a celebrity, but pundits, talking heads, they're every bit the celebrity and a lot of them aren't any more qualified than the average man on the street.","There are some actor secrets you keep sometimes, and you want to keep.","There are very few things that are purely conceptual without any hard content.","Some people have therapy, some people are alcoholics or they're in AA. Some people jump out of planes on weekends or find ways to release this kind of thing. And for me, it's acting. I find acting very therapeutic for whatever it is.","I don't watch the movies I make, so I haven't seen 'Footloose' since it came out. You see this young, hungry actor, it's pretty fun. I was the only one they screen tested. It was an attempt by the director and producer to talk the head of the studio into hiring me because they didn't want me.","Things could be worse. You remember that, and you go on with your life.","When it happened to us and it was all gone overnight, we said, 'We are in this together, we are healthy, our children are healthy and we can work'.","There is a lesson there about greed and it is a lesson I am willing to learn as well. Has it made me a distrustful person? I don't think so. But we probably look a bit more carefully at our financial situation now.","I'll be honest with you. My kids don't watch my movies and never have. I can maybe name a film one hand that they've seen, actually, all the way through.","If you look at films about becoming a man, coming-of-age movies are made with 12-, 16-, 40-, 50-year-olds... For a guy to feel like he's a 100 percent grown-up is almost like giving up. Like admitting that you're on your way into the grave.","I'm very comfortable being married to an extremely strong, opinionated, and driven woman. But I also sit at the head of the table. I have both of those sides to me.","With a lot of actors, you've got to chip through the surface to see who the real person is.","There are two things that create opportunities. One is being involved with something that makes money, and the other is winning awards. And the reason that winning the awards creates the opportunities is because it gives the people who are selling the picture the opportunity to make more money.","I've been in silly movies and romantic movies and historic movies.","I try to show compassion to people I come into contact with and try to put good out, as much good as I can. But that's my life; that's not my work. With my work, my job is to walk in another man's shoes.","I feel like my responsibility as an actor is to make characters as compelling and believable as possible.","My kids don't watch my movies. What I want to do is go home and hug my kids, talk to them and engage with them.","My brother is the lifelong musician; he made the choice to do that when we were very, very young kids. I remember him playing in bands and listening to the music he was writing in the house - he's nine years older than me.","When it comes to music, it's my clothes, it's my guitar, it's my voice, it's my song.","I'm a vagabond. I have a suitcase that is ready to go at a moment's notice. The thought of being in one place for a long time, or playing one character for a long time, is terrifying for me.","My family survived losing money to Bernie Madoff incredibly well compared to others.","My dad was an architect, and he wasn't a rich guy, but in our little world in Philadelphia, he was famous. He loved to see his picture in the paper. I wanted to be more famous than him.","I think of myself more as a workhorse actor. It will be hot and cold and up and down, but no one will kick me out of the business.","I want to see the numbers that prove that show-business marriages are any less successful than other marriages. It's just very public when they fail.","I think of being an actor as kind of a young man's gig. It's emasculating, in a way, people messing with you and putting make-up on you and telling you when to wake up and when to go to sleep, holding your hand to cross the street. I can do it up to a certain point, and then I start to feel like a puppet.","There are two types of actors: those who say they don't want to be famous, and those who are liars.","Fame is very much a double-edged sword.","Show me an actor who doesn't want to be famous, and I'll show you a liar. Later, you realise that there's more to it than just the acquisition of fame, and money and girls. But that is what drives them and was what drove me, initially.","Kevin's mind goes to extremely interesting places. Every time we get a script, I go, 'Oh my God, I really didn't see that coming'.","I started working in the mid-to-late Seventies, when television was not what it is now.","My father was into fame and leaving his mark. He was a city planner, sort of a genius in that world, the Robert Moses of Philadelphia. He was on the cover of 'Time' once, and I remember going to his office and seeing, like, two hundred copies, which he would hand out to people.","Great writing makes great television.","For my wife and I, for so many years, a lot of our identity was based on being Hollywood haters. We were like, 'We're east-coast. We're New Yorkers. This is just a place that we have to come to, but not by choice.'","I always have to make it as clear as I possibly can that fame is 99.9 percent good.","I'm not someone who comes onstage and says, 'I'm rewriting this now.' I don't think it's fair to the writers or the director, or the other actors.","I was in the first 'Friday The 13th,' and that was a microbudget horror film.","I like playing complex, interesting characters. Sometimes I don't think there's much of a strong line between right and wrong for a character. Every character is somewhere on a moral spectrum.","A moustache is actually the one thing I really can grow. One of the bad parts about my facial hair situation is that I can't grow sideburns. I'm happy to still have my own hair on my head, but I can't grow any sideburns. If you ever see me with sideburns, they're not real.","'Gogglebox' is a show where you watch people watch television.","I used to live on Riverside Park in New York, on the Upper West Side.","'The River Wild' was great, with Meryl Streep. That guy was really a bad dude who was ultimately sort of fundamentally impotent in a weird way. That was kind of interesting.","I like to play characters, man. I almost don't even think of them as good guys or bad guys. I know that's a hard thing to realize, but I really just think of them as characters.","'X-Men: First Class' was fun.","I have fond memories of Chris Penn, who's sadly not with us. He always made me laugh - it was great to be with him.","Keep doing what you're doing. Don't be afraid of fame.","Fame is something that is tough when it comes. It's a weird thing to take on in real life. I was a little bit afraid and, as a result, kind of turned my back on it. You should embrace it because it's going to be a part of who you are, and it's going to be a part of what this business is about.","If you look at my movie career, I do switch it up a lot. I'm always looking for a lot of different parts. It's been a while since I've been in a situation that was romantic.","From the time I signed on to 'The Following,' things have already vastly changed in the entertainment world in general. It's an adjustment for me.","I started making movies in 1977, and I didn't even think about the idea that I would ever be on a television show. Once I finished the 'Guiding Light,' I was like, 'I'm done with television!'","I'm new to this TV thing, at least as an actor. It's a challenge. The thing I have to adjust to is the changing directors every week. That's new for me. I tend to establish with a director - and then two days later, he's gone.","I wanted to do something heroic if I was going to be on TV. And the first thing that appeals to me once I have decided I don't want to be the bad guy is to find things that are not black and white.","I wasn't going off to New York to be more famous than my father, but in retrospect, that certainly was driving me. He was famous in Philadelphia, but it was also really important to him to be famous. And to a certain extent, I got some of that, even though there were parts of it that horrified me.","Whether it's my age or my misspent youth, sometimes I forget whether I've worked with somebody or not.","In my movie work, if I do one guy, the next guy I do, I want to do something kind of different. Even in terms of genre - it's really great to mix it up a little.","With 'Transparent'. When Amazon put 'Transparent' up, along with 'Bosch' and a few other things, I watched them, and I thought it was an interesting exercise. I didn't comment on them, but I was like, 'Okay, this is kind of cool.'","I did a year of 'Guiding Light', and I was going to be a movie actor or a stage actor, but not a TV actor. That just wasn't going to happen. And obviously, things changed so remarkably.","For years and years, people would say, 'The business is changing.' And I would say, 'The business is not changing. It's exactly the same as it was in the '70s, the '80s and the '90s.' But all of a sudden, the business changed, and it really did change.","Doing funny scary is something that is rarely good and rarely works, and it's also something that's incredibly hard to market.","The way I analyze a script, I don't look at how many days I have off. I see how far they're going to push me. That's just the way I am.","From an acting standpoint, when I was a kid, I thought I knew everything there was to know. As the years go by, this craft becomes more intensive as I get older. You realize how much more there is to know and to learn, and how much better you can get, if you really work at it.","I still want to make Kyra proud of the person I am - father, husband, actor, musician.","Being with Kyra is so natural for me; it's the easiest aspect of my life. I know that I don't need a beach or room service to be happy.","Do you want to be the guy with a game named after you or be the one with 18 Oscar nominations?","If you take me out of it, I find 'six degrees' to be a beautiful concept that we should try to live by. It's about compassion and responsibility for everyone on the planet.","There is this idea that your social media platform is the secret to success, but no one has quite proven that to be true, if you ask me.","Somebody with a billion followers can tweet, 'See my movie,' and it can still tank. Followers don't always translate into success because I think people are too savvy. When something takes off, it's because people are connecting to it - not because someone with a lot of followers says to care about it.","The whole industry is changing because so many people watch things on DVR, and they watch things on other platforms, and I think everybody is kind of scratching their heads about how this is going to play out.","You have to have something in your life that's more important than the work. People don't really like to admit that. They say, 'Oh, my work is my most important thing.'","To me, the struggle is to try to make a less-well-written or less-well-rounded character and find who they are. If you really get it, and it's all on the page, then it's really just gonna pop out at you.","I don't have any plans of slowing down. I love being an actor.","I like to hike and cook. I enjoy furniture and design - not making it, just looking at it. I'm always kind of trying to spread my interests around and try new things.","You can sit around and complain that Hollywood doesn't make any good movies. But you can generate your own material. So I read books. I come up with ideas. I was the producer on 'The Woodsman' to help get that off the ground. Sometimes that extends itself to directing.","The most challenging work and the best work I've ever done was in a thing I did for PBS called 'Lemon Sky', a play by Lanford Wilson. I think it's the rawest, most complex work that I've had to do, and the thing I'm most proud of."],"Kevin Bales":["The flow of people into the United States into slavery, it follows the other types of immigration into the United States, so people who are trying to build new lives, trying to build a better life.","If you look at slavery across all human history, and you sort of strip away the packaging, whether it's racialized or religious-based, and you look at the actual core of the slavery, it's one person completely controlling another one."],"Kevin Barry":["I have always felt a special affinity with V. S. Pritchett. He worked from the ear, primarily, as I do, and he was an all-rounder, writing short stories, novels, memoir, travelogue, critical biography. He lived to be almost 100, and he never stopped, and his work is unified by a great generosity of spirit.","When you wake up, instead of checking emails on your phone, or counting your retweets, pick up a pen and scratch a few sentences into a notebook.","'City of Bohane' has been optioned for film, and I've finished a first draft of the script.","I don't quite operate within the realist mode. I kind of push the stories out towards the cusp of believability - that's the area of interest for me.","In the early nineties, I was a cub reporter on a city newspaper in Limerick, and assigned to the courthouse there. One day, an old detective sergeant came and whispered to me in the press pit. He pointed out a young offender, a teenager who was up for stealing a car or something relatively minor, and said, 'See this kid? He'll kill.'","The fundamental human truth underpinning 'Ox Mountain Death Song' is that men so very often turn into their fathers. The way that everything gets passed down.","I remember, as a child, a particular groan that my father would sound when he crawled from the bed in the morning. I hear the same groan now, precisely, every morning, when I emerge from my own lair. It's more than an expression of physical weariness - it's an aching of the soul. Even the groans get passed down.","I was writing fiction in my 20s but in a pretty undisciplined way - late at night, maybe, after I'd peeled myself from the walls of a nightclub and crawled home along the gutters. But I slowly became more serious and more devout in my work, and I fell seriously in love with the short story form.","I greatly enjoyed working as a freelance journalist, because it gets you out of the house, and it gets you talking to people, but it wasn't satisfying all of my cravings, and I knew that I needed to work with the other side of my brain - the darker, murkier side!","I think journalism is useful training for a writer in the way it takes the preciousness out of the pragmatic side of the craft.","In my very early days as a journalist, as a cub reporter on a local newspaper, I used to cover the district courthouse in Limerick city - all human life passed through that establishment, and my time there remains a source of inspiration.","I think the language as spoken in Limerick and Cork has not really been written; 'City of Bohane' is a combination of the two. Bohane is a little kingdom. When I began writing it, I realised that it was in the future and that it was a place that didn't care about anything that happened outside it.","I was freelancing for years in Cork and around. I also wrote freelance pieces for 'The Irish Times.'","I have been as influenced by music and films as by books.","I like to be happy when I'm writing. If not, then how will the reader manage?","Frazzled and delirious, as I've just finished a new book of stories. I feel like Moses staggering down the mountainside with the tablets of stone.","I was a cub reporter on a local newspaper in Limerick city, and I used to cover the district court meetings. All of life passed through the Limerick courthouse. Misery, malevolence, the dark side of humanity... I tell ya, it made 'Angela's Ashes' look like 'The Wonderful World of Disney.'","Get up, groan, write a bit, moan, eat breakfast, write some more, cycle my bike through the Sligo hills, make up country songs as I pedal along, sing them, have lunch, have a nap, groan, moan, write a small bit more, cook dinner, feed wifey, open a bottle, or several, slump, sleep.","I go to Spain a lot, in winter, for a blast of sunlight to banish the blues brought on by the Irish greys and drizzle. I love the cities of the Spanish interior.","Irish writing is so strong that it can feel like the country has all been covered, but in fact, there are so many gaps. The small west of Ireland cities and the working classes there have almost never appeared in Irish literature, simply because those communities were never in the way of producing books.","One of the things I've been most excited by is U.S. television drama. For my money, it's some of the greatest narrative art of our time. Each series is like a 19th-century Russian novel: you need to do a lot of work in the first few episodes, just as you do in the first 50-60 pages of those books.","I go into my workroom seven mornings a week. There will only be one or two mornings a week where it seems to be going well, but to earn those days you have to go through slow, slodgy days where your mind feels like porridge.","It was quite risky to open the book with one of my quieter stories; I'm kind of trying, I think, to lure readers into a false sense of security and then assault them with a couple really loud, really strange stories.","Don DeLillo's 'White Noise,' which I read when I was 19. It showed me that a book can be funny as hell and deadly serious.","Very first thing in the morning, I spew some rough genius directly on to the laptop. Then I have coffee and rewrite for three hours.","I wanted to write about Jews in Montana, so I went there by plane and bus, only to discover that there are no Jews in Montana. It didn't deter me.","I've had lots of people saying very nice things about the work. But I genuinely feel in the course of a writing career you're going to have people say very nice things and some not-so-nice things, and if at all possible you should try to ignore both.","There's no mistaking the fact that some of the best longform fiction out there now is in American television. 'The Wire' and 'Deadwood' and 'The Sopranos.'","At one point I would read nothing that was not by the great American Jews - Saul Bellow, Philip Roth - which had a disastrous effect of making me think I needed to write the next great Jewish American novel. As a ginger-haired child in the West of Ireland, that didn't work out very well, as you can imagine.","What greatly annoys me is sometimes you see the short story being described as a training ground for the novel. Kind of like an apprenticeship. And in lots of ways, it's a far harder form.","Libraries are where we learn that we can live our lives through books.","The short story is a very natural mode of storytelling; most stories can be told quickly. I always think of them as like a tightrope walk - every sentence is a step along the rope, and you can so easily misplace your step and break your neck."],"Kevin Bleyer":["No one likes the Electoral College, expect perhaps those who were elected because of it. No one likes gerrymandering, except those doing the gerrymandering. No one likes the filibuster, except those doing the filibustering.","The real Stephen Colbert is a practicing Catholic. He teaches Sunday school. He can recite chapter and verse of chapter and verse - from both the King James Bible and 'The Lord of the Rings.'","When I was a kid, while touring East Berlin - back when there was an East Berlin - I got my left foot stuck in an escalator in Alexanderplatz. A few hours later, thanks to blowtorches and chainsaws and East German soldiers and the U.S. Embassy, my foot was released, and I along with it.","To research my book 'Me the People' - in which I have rewritten the entire Constitution of the United States - I flew to Greece, the birthplace of democracy. I bused to Philly, the home of independence. I even, if you can believe it, read the Constitution of the United States.","Diplomats willing to sit for an interview usually prefer the terra firma of CNN over the whoopee cushion of Comedy Central.","To be sure, the hard-to-come-by interview - the 'get' - isn't an uncommon phenomenon here at 'The Daily Show.' We've had high-profile dignitaries, low-profile indignitaries, stars you've heard of, authors you should have read.","Am I the only one who can't seem to reconcile the grand canyon of cognitive dissonance I feel when people with much more important jobs than I have manage to score much lengthier times off?","I suppose it's true that most great television, literature, and other forms of high art (and basic cable) benefit from a little hindsight. 'M.A.S.H.' comes to mind. So does 'The Iliad.'","Sports exact too harsh a toll on our beautiful women. Like engendered species, they should be protected, and instead, we exploit them and demand they fly too close to the sun for our amusement. We send them into the arena for an exhausting three-setter, an 18-hole playoff, a 200th lap. The burnout factor is insurmountable.","Republicans, say Democrats, are too simplistic about what ails America, and their solutions are straight out of 'J.A.G.'","For Democrats, nothing is any less complex than a 'West Wing' episode.","'The Sopranos' only reflected the tenor of how things are done in New Jersey. They didn't invent it. And I say that as a fan of both 'The Sopranos' and New Jersey.","Yes, my fellow citizens, despite what the original Constitution of the United States says about the qualifications for statehood and the guarantee of representation in Congress, by every measure that truly matters in America (bigness, crowdedness, awesomeness, Texasness), Nebraska doesn't deserve its star on the American flag.","Laws made in Alaska, which is known for its lawlessness, are as valid as laws made in Pennsylvania, which invented laws.","Never mind what makes Canada's constitution so special. Probably something to do with hockey, or the inalienable right to poutine, or securing the blessings of Rick Moranis.","The Constitution's Preamble, its renowned introductory passage, was written by a man with a peg-leg. Which, if you think about it, gives our Constitution hardly a leg to stand on.","Our Congress should stay in session all summer - camp out in D.C., and turn off the AC. Put on their stuffiest powdered wigs and sweat it out, until they give in and put their John Hancocks (and their Nancy Pelosis and their John Boehners) on at least one meaningful law that no one wants to repeal."],"Kevin Brady":["Inflation destroys savings, impedes planning, and discourages investment. That means less productivity and a lower standard of living.","Whether you are pro-choice or strongly pro-life, as I am, there should be common ground that abortion ceases to be an option when a baby can live outside the mother's womb or experience excruciating pain from a procedure.","We will never be defined by tragedy but, instead, by how we respond to it.","There is a difficult leap between talking about balancing the budget and actually doing it.","Tax reform for the 21st century means rewarding hardworking families by closing unfair loopholes, lowering tax rates across the board, and simplifying the tax code dramatically. It demands reducing the tax burden on American businesses of all sizes so they can keep more of their income to invest in our communities.","Urgency creates decision making.","I think NAFTA has been extremely beneficial to the United States, in many ways, but there's no question after 23 years it needs to be updated, to say the least.","You know Washington. If the deadline is midnight, they'll start working on it at 11:30.","We're going to have to find a way to serve our constituents and our taxpayers better and quicker and more accurately with fewer workers. I'm convinced we can do it and we don't have a choice.","Tax Day is often a source of frustration for taxpayers, so anything that can make the process less painful is appreciated.","We want to deliver tax relief all across the country, no matter where you live.","Our broken tax code is one of the main reasons the United States lags behind when it comes to economic growth, job creation, and competitiveness. Without pro-growth tax reform, our workers and our businesses will continue to suffer.","The Fed contributed to the financial crisis, keeping interest rates too low for too long. I give them credit for responding and stabilizing the economy and the financial sector during the crisis. But then they tried to do too much with quantitative easing that went on forever, just dramatically exploding their balance sheets.","Our focus is on ensuring America has the strongest economy in the world for the next 100 years and to do that, we need to get to the role of the Federal Reserve and we need to get it right.","Under Obamacare - which placed 159 federal agencies, commissions, and bureaucracies between patients and doctors - patients not only face dramatically higher health care costs, they've also lost the power to choose the options right for them.","At the end of the day, Republican-driven tax reform is not only going to be good for the economy and for growth. It's going to be good for middle-class Americans.","I firmly believe Americans are far better off under tax reform than they ever were sticking with this old, messed up, outdated tax code.","When we don't unite, we do a terrible job.","Ways and Means is the committee that tackles the big issues that affects people's lives and their jobs in a major way.","To achieve responsible budget savings, government must be retooled with an effective spending-control system.","I'm not going to risk our precious military resources on an ineffective, unproductive mission.","Whole communities have been devastated as good-paying jobs continue to leave the U.S.","What we lack is a good, strong business climate with lower taxes, fairer regulation.","And again, President Obama's health care plan really is another drag on the economy. Until we get Washington out of the way, this president's recovery is going to continue to rank dead last.","And I am convinced that a single focus on preserving the purchasing power of the dollar, in effect, guarding against inflation or deflation, actually creates a solid foundation for the greatest job growth and the strongest economy that America can have.","This bill, the Sound Dollar Act, is all about looking forward about the role the Fed should play.","I've spent my whole life before coming to Congress as a Chamber of Commerce manager. What that means is you help start small businesses, help them grow in good times and bad.","Here's my thinking: Since tax reform only occurs once a generation, let's not tweak what we have and call it a day.","Dave Camp, in my view, made tax reform inevitable in the sense that he showed you could broaden the base and lower the rates and simplify the code and be competitive around the world and make it more understandable.","If we truly want to achieve lasting economic growth, we need our businesses to do more business - and we need them to do it in America.","If we were starting from scratch, there's no question a simple retail consumption tax with protections for those with lower incomes would drive the economy the best and be the simplest to administer.","South Dakota, like a lot of rural states, small states, there are small cities with a very big work ethic, very common sense approach. That has certainly shaped me.","I think it is a mistake to withdraw from Trans-Pacific Partnership because if America abandons the Asia Pacific markets, we'll lose.","It's just wrong to work your whole life to build up a nest egg, build your own business - you pass away, and Uncle Sam can swoop in and take away nearly half of everything you've earned. Can you imagine that? Having to sell off most of your land just to keep it from the government, just to save the house.","America's tax code is beyond repair. Tinkering with it won't work. The only hope is a bold tax-reform plan that will liberate our nation from the slow-growth status quo and jump-start a new era of American prosperity and growth.","I want to give consumers way more choices in health care. Choice and competition always drive down costs better than central control.","The world has changed. It's not enough to simply buy American; we have to sell American, sell our products and goods and services throughout this world.","I've always intuitively liked the consumption-tax model.","I'm a strong-and-stable-dollar advocate, and the Fed has been moving dangerously away from that mission.","When American workers are losing their jobs to people in other countries, Washington cannot afford to ignore this disturbing trend any longer. While Democratic presidential candidates want to just blame U.S. corporations, the reality is that their strategy won't help protect American workers or save their jobs.","It's time to permanently lower America's tax gate so that the $2 trillion in stranded U.S. profits can flow back into America to be invested in new jobs, research and growth.","In my view, the biggest challenge facing this country is that we are not living within our means. Spending cuts can only get us halfway there.","We need a simpler, fairer tax code that protects taxpayers. Not special interests.","Tax reform is the legislative challenge of a generation for America. It hasn't been accomplished since 1986, when President Reagan and Congress delivered the most sweeping overhaul of our nation's tax code in American history. 2017 is the year to change that and make history of our own.","As chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee - the chief tax-writing body in Congress - I understand that true comprehensive tax reform is tremendously difficult.","The Reagan tax reform delivered real fairness, closing loopholes for Washington special interests so that all Americans could keep more of their hard-earned paychecks.","My belief is that despite all the media hoopla, there is much more that unites Republicans than divides us.","We cannot allow American taxpayers to foot the bill for tax revenue grabs in Europe and elsewhere.","We must move aggressively in Asia-Pacific because our competitors like China are moving very swiftly to tie down a regional trade agreement that leaves... our farmers and our workers and our businesses out.","No one has yet convinced me a dollar stranded overseas is better than a dollar brought back home here to America for any reasons. So, if a company needs it, whether it's to do research, buy another business in America, grow jobs or try to become more financially strong, that is good for the United States.","What I'm absolutely certain of is, every day we delay in accessing that Asia-Pacific region, the more we lose economically.","The Affordable Care Act has hurt more people that it's helped.","Texas is made for trade.","Americans need health care focused on them, not Washington. They want choices, not more mandates. They want affordable plans with ready access to local doctors and hospitals - not high-priced plans with doctors they don't know.","Americans deserve a simple, fairer, and flatter tax code that jumpstarts our economy, helps create jobs, and makes America a leader again.","I'm tired of seeing American jobs, manufacturing, and headquarters forced overseas due to a tax code that works against us.","America's fiscal future is frightening.","We must cut federal spending - every wasted dollar, every low priority program, and every unconstitutional overreach - every day.","As the American people have discovered, soaring rhetoric is no substitute for effective leadership on the key issues facing our nation: jobs, runaway spending, and an exploding government debt.","Soaring rhetoric will not restore the American people's confidence in their government.","My friends and family know I love playing baseball - Little League through college. And every year in the annual Congressional Baseball Game for charity played at Nationals Stadium.","In 2012, I helped lead the successful effort in Congress to allow states to conduct drug testing of people receiving unemployment benefits.","One of America's best investments in peace and security is our special relationship with Israel.","Our Savior's birth is the ultimate reminder that miracles happen and often when we don't expect them.","Our compassion for one another, and our individual actions to help, is what makes our nation - and our community - great.","This turbulent world is far from a perfect place.","The single greatest force for deficit reduction is a growing economy.","Americans have seen the value of the dollar slowly decline due to the steady erosion of inflation.","Requiring the Fed to focus on preserving the purchasing power of the dollar will create a solid foundation for economic growth.","Houston is a dynamic, international city shaped by leaders who dreamed big and acted with an eye firmly focused on the long term.","A stronger global hub at Bush means a stronger economic future for Houston.","Longer and more frequent delays for international passengers at Bush will only cede business to Houston's competitors - and the jobs that go along with it.","American jobs are being lost to foreign countries, and U.S. companies are urged to move their manufacturing plants, new technologies and headquarters overseas.","For decades, American companies, large and small, have been competing with one hand tied behind their backs thanks to our unfair, outdated tax code.","Given a choice between President Trump with more freedom for Americans and ObamaCare with more government, I chose to stand with President Trump and freedom.","One of the most offensive actions by the IRS is its continued unlawful seizures of money and assets of innocent Americans, called civil asset forfeiture.","As chairman of the tax-writing House Ways & Means Committee, I continue to be inspired by President Reagan's 1985 national address to the American people as he challenged them to join him in boldly reforming the broken, complex tax code.","As Chairman of the Ways and Means committee, I am proud to have written about half of the American Health Care Act that passed the House so we can finally provide Americans with patient-centered healthcare that fits your family's needs.","Washington knows how to spend money.","If Washington were a factory, it would manufacture spending.","The harsh reality is that we simply cannot tax our way out of our overspending and debt problem. We need a balanced approach that includes both a stronger economy to generate new tax revenues and bipartisan guardrails, which will help ensure that future presidents and congresses spend within our means.","The global boom in commodities fueled by a debt-financed infrastructure and real-estate bubble in China is over.","Congress must build on the success of the Budget Control Act.","We need smarter, 21st-century budget guardrails that would gradually trim the size of Washington in order to spur private investment, create jobs, and boost the income of hard-working Americans on Main Street.","Unlike the American inventions and achievements that have expanded horizons of possibility, our nation's tax code has become an excessive burden that strangles individual opportunity and economic freedom.","The speakers I value don't just sound intelligent but can boil down complex issues in a clear, understandable way that encourages the public to think about the solutions.","One of my most rewarding congressional duties is nominating future military leaders to study at America's service academies. The exceptional young men and women who receive these coveted nominations earn a top-of-the-line education and the opportunity to serve their country as a military officer.","Voters have figured out Republicans want to save Medicare for the long term, and they know that those who say everything's just fine with it aren't leveling with them.","I think it's important, especially in health care, to take this step by step, whether it's the replacement of the Affordable Care Act, how we make Medicaid work better, how we save Medicare for the long term.","I'm absolutely confident - in fact, I'm optimistic that by focusing on quality and innovation in Medicare - that we can save that program for the long term in a very positive way.","Obamacare's design flaws were not the fault of the American people.","The people now trapped in Obamacare did what the government mandated them to do - they complied with the law. They should not be left out to dry.","I stopped - just killed - President Obama's $10-a-barrel gas tax.","I love trade. I love trade. First, it's economic freedom. It's the freedom to buy, sell, and compete with as little government interference as possible. Secondly, it's a jobs issue.","We think Medicare Advantage is a key part of healthcare and is bringing some of the innovation - I think a lot of the innovation - back to that marketplace for seniors.","I know we disagree with Mr. Trump on this area. I'm hopeful that we can convince him that making our tax code more pro-growth will make America stronger, but to do that, it's not enough to simply buy American: we need to sell American all throughout the world.","I wanted to be clear that Republicans will continue to be a champion for expanding economic freedom to trade. It is at the heart of our free-enterprise system.","There are real impacts from lowering tax rates, encouraging savings.","America's real national security interest in the region is protecting our friend Israel.","Full and immediate expensing is widely recognized as one of the most pro-growth tax policies around.","The ability to immediately deduct the costs of capital investments will help employers improve worker productivity and output - which grows Main Street jobs. And with these savings, businesses across the country will have more freedom to grow, hire new workers, and increase wages.","For years, people have begged Washington for a tax code that is simple and easy to understand."],"Kevin Brockmeier":["I keep an ongoing list of my fifty favorite books, which I recalibrate whenever I discover a new one that seems to demand a spot there.","I'm a Sagittarius, born in the year of the rat, all of which is basically meaningless to me.","I write out of gratitude for all the books I have loved over the years.","I can tell you that I never begin working on a story until I have a title centered at the top of the first page."],"Kevin Brownlow":["I was sent to boarding school - a grim place. The only good thing the headmaster did for us was every Sunday evening in the winter he would show us films in the chapel. He couldn't afford a sound projector, so we saw silent films, which you could then still rent from photographic shops.","Silent pictures show us how we lived and what our attitudes were. And as an art form, they can be wonderfully entertaining and often inspirational.","My first restoration was on 'Napoleon,' trying to put the French version in with the English version, and it was most unsatisfactory.","To me, film is a religion. I don't expect to get paid to make it, but I do expect total dedication.","Somebody said that part of my reaction to British cinema is actually, paradoxically, a patriotic one. I'm so disappointed that we're not better.","Some directors were brilliant in the silent era but never felt at home in sound. It's like a sculptor being forced to take up painting.","I decided to restore 'Napoleon' after a widescreen festival at the Odeon Leicester Square in 1968. It was run by Richard Arnell and George Dunning, who animated and directed 'Yellow Submarine,' and they'd got their hands on the last scene, the triptychs. They just showed that part, without music and with the projectors misaligned.","'Napoleon' is pure cinema, and cinema was designed for sharing.","It was 1953, and I was still at school. I'd borrowed a silent French film from the library for my 9.5mm projector. It was by Jean Epstein, and it was awful. So I rang the library and asked if they had anything else. They said they had 'Napoleon Bonaparte and the French Revolution.'","I realised that you could easily turn any room into a cinema with a projector, so I went on and on at my parents for one. They eventually got me a projector for Christmas when I was ten, and I realised I'd made a ridiculous mistake - I'd forgotten to say 'movie' projector; I got a still one.","Friends told me not to bother with the silents - they're jerky, poorly photographed and ludicrously badly acted. But I was immediately struck by the freshness and vitality of these films.","The reason I put so much energy into it at the beginning was that while there were plenty of people looking after the talkies, almost nobody was doing the same for the silents. Now there are plenty of very good historians and restorers."],"Kevin Canty":["The moment I'm interested in, the moment I'm working toward in these stories, is when the familiar world seems strange.","I would rather eat broken glass and drink iodine than do the dishes.","The sense of discovery only comes when I'm making discoveries alongside the reader. It feels crucial for me to not know too much about how things will turn out. So I try to develop strong characters with recognizable desires and put them together with other characters and see what happens.","If it's present in the life of the character, I'll write about it. Kitchen, bedroom, church, I'll follow a character wherever they go."],"Kevin Chamberlin":["The big difference between TV and theater is that you get to do a new play every week, so it's quite challenging, but it keeps you fresh. There's never any fear of getting stale in your performance.","I think whatever art form you're in, whether TV, film or theater, you should know the history of who came before you and how the art form has changed or not changed and to learn from the greats.","When I auditioned for 'Jessie,' I knew that Disney Channel basically will do 100 episodes of a show if it's a hit; they'll stick with something. It's a great network to work with because they make a nice big commitment to a show.","We don't get the Tony gift basket anymore. You used to get incredible swag - there was like $5,000 worth of stuff. I remember getting an MP3 player, gift certificates to restaurants, a three-year gym membership.","Awards do not pay the mortgage."],"Kevin Chapman":["I really enjoyed playing Freddie Cork. People are always scared to approach me because of the character I played in 'Brotherhood.' The writing was very smart.","I feel that 'Person of Interest' is the same quality as 'Brotherhood.' I think it's one of the smartest network television shows on the air today. The audience is a wide range of individuals.","The stuff I did in 'Rescue Me' was great. It gave me the opportunity to play comedy, and Denis Leary was the first one to take a chance with me. And from that experience, we had a comedy pilot that we did that I was going to play the lead in. And then 'Person of Interest' came along. They're all new experiences.","I did a film called 'Black Dynamite' that was very, very funny. That seems to be a film that's kind of a cult classic.","I like to refer to myself as 'The George Clooney of the Lane Bryant set.'"],"Kevin Connolly":["Believe me, I've taken a lot of heat for my mustache.","I got no entourage in real life. Solo. I go solo. No entourage.","I'm not married, and I don't have any kids, so sometimes I envy that end of things when I see a family vacation or people at the beach with their kids or at sporting events with their kids; you wonder, 'Is that a part of your life that you want to go into?'","Nobody would ever, ever get even remotely lippy about the Islanders with me, or there'd be bloodshed on the set of 'Entourage.' Everybody knows that you don't even go there.","My favorite personal hockey moment was probably when Mike Bossy scored fifty goals in fifty games. He was the first one to do it since Rocket Richard. I was young when it happened, but I remember it very distinctly.","I've always said, 'Besides Kiefer Sutherland, I talked on a cell phone more than any other actor on a TV show.'","My agent hates my directing career!","I'm proud of where I'm from. I'm proud of Long Island.","The truth of the matter is, I'm a filmmaker.","The thing that everyone liked about 'Entourage' is that these are fish-out-of-water guys living this dream.","There are people who didn't like 'The Departed,' you know?","As an actor, there are so many different people to hide behind.","I've always thought the expression 'passion project' was kind of a cliche until I started working on 'Big Shot' for 'ESPN.'","I've been acting for 30 years. It's a grind.","I live in L.A. and love L.A., and you couldn't drag me out of there kicking and screaming.","It's amazing what we remember as sports fans, right?","I did host the Jim Rome show with Jerry Ferrara for three hours when he was on vacation. Three hours is a long time. Think about how long that is. It was tricky, but it was a great experience.","If you know the filmmaker is good and the leading actor is a movie star like Diane Lane, you know you're part of something great.","I've been very supportive of the Islanders. I'm at every home opener.","Growing up, 'Newsday' was the paper that was delivered to my doorstep every day.","I'm a big Clive Owen fan.","James Woods is great. I actually did a movie with James Woods in 2000: 'John Q.'","Stories always seem to get better with age.","James Van Der Beek and I go way back. We were in the movie 'Angus' together in 1994 or 1995, so I've known him for a million years.","It's funny because Hollywood is such a small place that everyone really is less than 6 degrees of separation.","I'm a rah, rah guy's guy. I like to talk about sports and put people in headlocks.","I'm a nostalgic guy.","Gary Bettman's a smart guy.","I think most people are afraid of what they don't know.","What I think happened to the new arenas is that you need some memories. I remember going when the Staples Center first opened and it was like, 'OK,' but a couple championships later, and all of a sudden it becomes your house. You have to stake claim to it.","The Islanders and their owner, Garth Snow, were very generous with me and let me do some cool stuff inside the organization.","San Anita is a beautiful track. It's not too far from my house in L.A., and it's a beautiful place to go and watch the horses run.","I'm not just saying this because I'm in the movie, but I really would recommend 'Secretariat.' It's fun, inspiring, and it's a great movie to take your little kids, brothers, sisters, or nieces and nephews to see that actually has real people in it and not animated characters.","You don't want to miss out on something and feel like an idiot.","I have some lifelong friends I grew up with.","Both my parents died on the young side. My father was 45, and my mother was 61, so cancer's affected me in a big way.","Nowadays, if you have a mustache, people look at you like you're crazy. But when I was growing up, I never saw my dad without a mustache.","I went from such a testosterone-driven show to the exact opposite, because 'Friends With Better Lives' is run by the ladies. I imagine it's close to what being married feels like.","'Entourage' is almost required watching in L.A., and everyone seems to have story suggestions for the show itself, which is amazing because it makes you realize the show's really struck a chord and found its audience.","I certainly feel as if I've been blessed professionally and personally, but I've still got moves I'd like to make.","'Entourage' is a very, very, very unique acting experience. I could go in to win 1000 Academy Awards, and it would never be as much fun as the show.","It's a lot of work that goes into producing and directing and all those kinds of things. It doesn't just happen. It's a lotta work. It's a lot more work than acting.","My agent said that every Monday after an episode of 'Entourage,' at the staff meeting at the agency, that's all they do is talk about the episode the night before.","That's the thing - I've never really been single. I always end up in a relationship immediately.","If you discuss other people, words get twisted; things get turned around.","I was a homecoming king in high school! I was involved. I was a good member of the community, I thought.","I'm not a player! I'm the girlfriend type! I always have girlfriends."],"Kevin Conroy":["Everyone is handed adversity in life. No one's journey is easy. It's how they handle it that makes people unique.","To me, Batman is definately Bruce Wayne's darker side. The challenge is playing it as two separate aspects of the same person. I have to create the illusion of a Dark Knight, who's mysterious and strong.","Bruce Wayne is Batman. He became Batman the instant his parents were murdered. Batman needs Bruce, however hollow that identity feels to him from time to time. Bruce keeps Batman human.","I love doing the voice of Batman because of the quality of the animation. The music is particularly incredible. Another bonus is getting the opportunity to work with some very respected actors who do not usually do voice work.","People fantasize about being a hero and helping someone in trouble. Batman is that fantasy realized - not just for Bruce Wayne, but for the audience.","I guess the biggest challenge to doing any kind of animation voice work is that you only have your voice to tell the story.","I guess I am basically most comfortable when I'm alone. As a kid, I was very much a loner. I love long distance running and long distance biking. A director once pointed out that those are all very isolated exercises you do for hours at a time.","Everyone has a private self and a public self."],"Kevin Corrigan":["I've had many idols growing up. The inclination for idol worship comes naturally to me.","I've had many idols growing up. The inclination for idol worship comes naturally to me. Or it did, anyway. I think I've gotten over it. It came as naturally to me as wanting to act.","There are a lot of actors whom I love, who personalize their work. I want to know everything about them, like De Niro, like Gary Oldman.","I don't really pretend to know what's going on, but I've been immersed in the excitement of watching sports, particularly football. I like baseball, probably more than football.","When I was working on 'Big Fan,' I didn't really feel like any lines needed to be changed or enhanced or expanded upon in any way. I thought it was a solid script. All you had to do was what it said.","Inspiration can come from anywhere. But I do love actors. I wish I could drop a bunch of names, but there are just too many."],"Kevin Costner":["I don't give up. I'm a plodder. People come and go, but I stay the course.","You have to decide if you're going to wilt like a daisy or if you're just going to go forward and live the life that you've been granted.","I haven't lived a perfect life. I have regrets. But that's from a lifetime of taking chances, making decisions, and trying not to be frozen. The only thing that I can do with my regrets is understand them.","If you don't understand your limitations you won't achieve much in your life.","I believe people who go into politics want to do the right thing. And then they hit a big wall of re-election and the pettiness of politics. In the end, politics gets in the way of the business of people.","I had a difficult time hearing my own inner voice about what I wanted to be in this life, because there were all these perfect examples of what a man actually does. The notion is that he goes to college, gets married and provides. That's what a man does.","Being a celebrity is probably the closest to being a beautiful woman as you can get.","If it's going to be wrecked, I want to make sure I wreck it.","I don't feel the need to direct. I tried to get other people to direct Dances, but they wouldn't do it. They all thought it was too long. One director wanted to cut the Civil War sequence. Another thought the white woman was very cliched.","If you're going to tear down a hero, you should never forget that you're tearing down someone else's hero. You're tearing down somebody else's son. You might have to face her one day.","Failure doesn't kill you... it increases your desire to make something happen.","We all have that burning question about what happens if we lose somebody we love, especially if we lose them tragically. We wonder what fear was going on, we wonder if we could have reached out and touched them, held their hand, looked in their eyes, been there.","Field of Dreams is probably our generation's It's A Wonderful Life.","If you're willing to tell somebody that you love them, are you also willing to say you're sorry? You need to, even when you think you're in the right.","One person doesn't have to shoulder all the responsibility for why a film does or doesn't do well.","I'm getting those familiar feelings, and I'm just going to enjoy the process of getting to know someone again.","You're this rat in the American maze, working your way towards the cheese, which is a job.","I know I have this level of celebrity, of fame, international, national, whatever you want to call it, but it's a pretty surreal thing to think sometimes that you're in the middle of another famous person's life and you think to yourself, 'How the hell did I get famous? What is this some weird club that we're in?'","I split my time between Santa Barbara and Aspen. I live on a pretty fast horse.","I'm a big fan of dreams. Unfortunately, dreams are our first casualty in life - people seem to give them up, quicker than anything, for a 'reality.'","When I read Thirteen Days I was moved by it. It was just a great time for the world, in terms of looking back in history and seeing how we got ourselves into trouble and how we got ourselves out of trouble.","In America, politicians do whatever to get re-elected, and a lot of decisions that were being made at that time by Kennedy were certain not to get him re-elected.","I've been around where I knew other actors were going to steal the scene, and I don't compete with them.","When I played Robin Hood, I knew the great role was Alan Rickman's and it didn't bother me. I always think that leading actors should be called the best supporting actors.","I'm a pretty convenient foil for a lot of people.","I enjoy sports. I get a real joy from playing sports but I don't look for those movies. Oliver Stone wanted to know if I would do Any Given Sunday and it just didn't appeal to me.","What are we blaming? Is this Vietnam? We made a movie, it didn't make much money. I'm gonna be really happy if somebody watches it in 10 years' time and really enjoys it.","Money isn't a major motivating force in my life. Nor is my profession. There are other things that I care more about than being an actor.","I work for the public, for the people who are paying to go to the cinema, rather than for the critics.","I don't think I ever take huge risks, though I'm not scared of doing so.","I think there are good men and women in all decades. We've grown cynical. And look at what we do to all our heroes: Churchill, FDR, Kennedy, they all had affairs. But heroic things happen every day.","I don't think I'd have been as good as Bruce was. He was a better JFK than I would have been.","When I make a film I'm away from home for two to three months. So I want my kids to look at my films one day and say, I love his movies, I love his choices-because he loved them.","I stand up for what I believe. I don't know if it's always paid off for me, because I've been ridiculed and humiliated.","I like when my face tingles, when the hair on the back of my neck stands up.","I'm glad movies aren't going to please everybody, they can't. But what they have to be is recognisable. I don't equate myself with a master painter, but I think you can recognise my films.","We stand our best chance of leaving a legacy to those who want to learn, our children, by standing firm. In matters of style, hey, swing with the stream. But in matters of principle, you need to stand like a rock.","I wait and take on projects that I think can work.","When I do a Western, I often wonder what I would have really done in that situation.","There's real drama in performing live. You never know how it's going to be.","When I see my children, and when I see the people who value me, I know how lucky I am.","I'm in a position where whatever I do, I can get my head handed to me. I'm in a position to fail because there is a whole group of people out there who want me to fail. It's a weird vibe.","I like four-hour movies.","I've always known that I'm a little out of vogue.","I am a really writer-oriented actor.","I try to please myself. I don't try to anticipate what people want to see.","I haven't tried to buffer myself. I like rolling the dice.","I'm only interested in being a good actor and in being remembered for my best films, not for the way I look. But it seems inevitable in this line of work that I have to care about the way I look without getting obsessed about it.","We still live with this unbelievable threat over our heads of nuclear war. I mean, are we stupid? Do we think that the nuclear threat has gone, that the nuclear destruction of the planet is not imminent? It's a delusion to think it's gone away.","I want to live forever, and I know I won't. I'm not afraid of dying. I'm only afraid of one thing: not being able to raise my kids.","You have to pick the stories that you want to be involved with and the end game is you'd like to be a part of a hit. But I think your moral obligation is to follow your own heart.","I wanted very much to do Traffic and at one point it looked like I was going to work on it. And then, of course, Catherine Zeta-Jones had her relationship with Michael Douglas and it suddenly didn't happen.","I'm proud of all the movies I've made. They're not sequels, they're not franchises. And the reason I pick my films carefully is that I don't want to spit on my life. I like to think of myself as more than that.","I am not a cynic.","There are a lot of things that come to bear on movies now that I don't think are good for movies. They're trying to appeal to the biggest demographic and, when they do that, you sometimes flatten out.","I think these movies are as much for people of that time as for people who weren't born. For people who weren't born, they see how leaders must act under a crisis situation, not trying to be re-elected or not trying to check polls, that they go from their gut check.","President Kennedy was willing to go to war. He was not a coward. The man had been in war and so had Ken O'Donnell. He was ready to protect this nation, but he was not ready for a military solution just because it was being rammed down his throat.","Lincoln was the greatest speaker and he was ridiculed for how he looked, you know?","I've had some movies that have been ridiculed, but that's OK with me. I don't feel that really defines me. Should I change who I am to be popular?","If you think of 'Liberty Valance' or 'The Searchers,' there are moments in there that you'll never, ever forget... And it does not matter what century you are from.","I think there's true drama in the formation of everything that we know and are standing on the shoulders of.","You have to try to dismiss the loudness of cynicism. It's certainly going to come.","I don't have a seller's remorse about how I've lived.","I was sucked into this vortex of a very conservative upbringing.","I like American history.","You just do the things that you love and see if other people can like them too."],"Kevin Cramer":["If you're a person of faith that is conservative, that's pro-life, as I am, that believes strongly in traditional family values, as I do... then how we talk about them matters.","Here's where I'm different from a senator. We pass continuing resolutions. We pass appropriations bills.","I have to be honest: I don't get many, if any - I don't know that I've ever received a phone call in my office from somebody that says they've been discriminated against based on their sexual orientation.","I really see the vocation of politics like I see every vocation - whether it's being a reporter or serving in public life or being a plumber - as an extension of ministry.","Sometimes, we find ourselves as conservatives being angry when we should be joyful, finding ourselves being negative when we should be positive, because we have a positive message to send... We ought to be the most compassionate people in the world.","I enjoy the debate... I haven't met a single person in Congress yet that I dislike. It's not about moderating your views: it's about being able to talk about them and defending them in a way that's uplifting to people.","I am a joyful conservative, unafraid to articulate big ideas with an optimistic smile.","My children range in age from 5 to 31. We adopted the 5-year-old, but people are often impressed with my wife before knowing that.","The greatest threats to North Dakota are policies coming out of Washington, D.C. I see it every day and feel a sense of responsibility to do something about it."],"Kevin Crossley-Holland":["When I was a boy, I took over the shed at the bottom of the garden and displayed fossils and potsherds and coins in it and proudly called it my 'museum'. I charged people to come in, and my most prized possession was a Saracen shield dating from the Crusades.","Most writers, by the time they're 60, must have revisited their childhood a dozen times.","Like any decent researcher, I throw away 90% of my research.","There are Arthurian legends in 14 or 15 medieval European languages. They are the product of no one time or place. On the contrary, in sum they represent a tremendous mine of human understanding, rather as the Bible does.","For each detail I include, I throw dozens away. So I guess the first trick is to pick the right details, the most revealing details. Then I think one must simply write quick, clean, bright prose. For me, this means rewriting and rewriting: almost never adding, almost always cutting.","Before Arthur, I'd dismissed altogether writing fiction. You only have so many semi-sharp arrows in your quiver, I'd told myself, and I was not going to be able to write a novel.","Think of 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.' It is equally intoxicating for children and adults. All this 'crossover' talk is something publishers are using as a selling device - a kind of post hoc rationalisation of what was happening already.","I see the role of the writer as creating a room with big windows and leaving the reader to imagine. It's a meeting on the page.","I am seriously interested in the psychology of childhood. And I've given a lot of my life to trying to see questions of personal development, as well as the great issues of the day, from a child's point of view.","Maybe if I ever come to write about my teens and adulthood - and I can't imagine I will - but if I do, then maybe I will want to say a bit more about the ways in which my parents' relationship with one another impacted on me in later years."],"Kevin Daniels":["I've always wanted to be one of those actors who could change from character to character, like Daniel Day Lewis or Jeffrey Wright.","I got into theater at an early age.","Researching Magic Johnson, I realized I clearly haven't done enough with my life.","I've been a fan of Loretta Devine's, since I was a kid, from 'Waiting To Exhale,' and she's been in so many of my favorite movies and television shows.","Theater and sports are connected. You've got your team - or ensemble - your goal and your determination to win."],"Kevin DeYoung":["I try to keep in my mind the simple question: Am I trying to do good or make myself look good? Too many of our responsibilities get added to our plate when we are trying to please people, impress people, prove ourselves, acquire power, increase our prestige. All those motivations are about looking good more than doing good.","The Bible tells us to love our neighbors as ourselves. Surely part of loving in this way is trying to understand what another person wants us to understand. I may not understand perfectly and I may not agree, but if I love you I should try to know what it is you wish I could know.","As a pastor in a Protestant church, my whole ministry centers on the conviction that by grace we are saved through faith. And it's not our faith that delivers us, as if believing something, anything at all were pleasing to God. It's the object of our faith - Christ's life, death, and resurrection - that saves us.","The mystery of the Christian life is that Christ expects us to flee sin and the devil, but does not expect us to rid ourselves of either on this side of glory. Repentance is a way of life, and so is the pursuit of godliness. I wish every Christian could be reminded of these two things.","God tells me that I need to provide for my family, discipline and teach my children, and love my wife as Christ loves the church. If I don't do that, I'm being unfaithful and sinful.","One of the central motivations for holiness in the New Testament is to be who you are, to understand your identity and your union in Christ and to live that way.","A catechism is simply a tool for teaching the fundamentals of the faith. Unlike a creed or confession, a catechism uses questions and answers. Many Protestant confessional traditions, like Lutherans, Presbyterians, and Reformed, have used catechisms for centuries. Initially, most catechisms were intended for children.","We live in an emotionally fragile culture. We are in touch with every hurt past, present, and perceived. We are the walking wounded, and we want everyone to know.","Much of the impotence of American churches is tied to a profound ignorance and apathy about justification. Our people live in a fog of guilt. Or just as bad, they think being a better person is all God requires.","We can't do every good thing there is to do in the world. Too many Christians live under the terror of total obligation, thinking every act of injustice, every opportunity of ministry, and every urgent appeal are our responsibilities.","My life often feels like a whirling dervish of kids, writing, speaking, and pastoral ministry.","Some of us live a Christian life as if we're always under the stern, watchful eye of our Father and he is very impossible to please... No, God delights even in our heartfelt attempts at obedience.","As Christians, we worship a victimized Lord. We should expect to suffer and should have particular compassion on those who hurt emotionally and physically. But we do not resemble the Suffering Servant when we take pains to show off our suffering.","Justification is God's declaration that we, though guilty sinners, are righteous in God's eyes.","As Christians we need to be patient, understanding, and kind. Instead of going on the attack, we can ask genuine questions. Instead of bristling when our narrative is summarily dismissed, we can carefully explain our way of seeing things. And when we are wrong, we won't be afraid to say so.","If we are busy in a hundred good things - even great things, gospel things, glorious things - but don't sit at the feet of Jesus, we are busy in the wrong ways.","Just very practically, pastors need to be careful that while they have a right to call people to absolute allegiance to the Word of God, we don't have the right to call people to absolute allegiance to our programs or every ministry we have at the church.","No doubt, some people are quantitatively less busy than others and some much more so, but that doesn't change the shared experience: most everyone I know feels frazzled and overwhelmed most of the time.","As a pastor, I addressed the sorts of issues I see people struggling with most and the issues talked about most directly and most frequently in the New Testament. That leads us to recurring concerns with sexual immorality, relational sins, and vices associated with the breaking of the Ten Commandments.","In the Lord's Prayer, Jesus assumes that asking for forgiveness would be a daily occurrence, as would praying that we might be delivered from evil and led not into temptation.","Many people suffer at the hands of others. The world can be unfair, at times mercilessly so. Millions of people in the world are genuine victims, right now. All of us will be at some point, whether it's for small matters or large, for a long duration or short. But we aren't all victims, not all the time anyway, not for everything.","Offendedness is just about the last shared moral currency in our country. And, I'm sorry, but it's really annoying. We don't discuss ideas or debate arguments, we try to figure out who is most offended.","The kind of experience of humility and happiness that comes with gratitude tends to crowd out whatever is coarse, or ugly, or mean.","When we use old confessions and catechisms, we help teach our people that their faith is an old faith, shared by millions over many centuries. We also help them realize that other Christians have asked the same questions.","The Heidelberg Catechism is like a refreshing bath with cool gospel water.","We use the Heidelberg Catechism in our worship. Sometimes we read it responsively. Other times I'll work it into my communion liturgy. I'll quote it in my sermons from time to time. I've seen the Catechism used effectively as Sunday school material.","Sometimes Christians live in a terror of universal obligation: AIDS over here, people to be saved over here, a crushing sense of low-level guilt every day of our lives. Question to ask: Where has God put me right now? I need to say no to a whole bunch of other things because if I don't say no I can't say yes to others.","Many of us think in terms in parental determinism: 'If I push all the right buttons my kids are going to turn out OK.' I want to instill in myself and my people a wonderful dose, not of carelessness, but of God's sovereignty. He knows the hairs on your kids' heads.","Sometimes feeling overwhelmed is part of what it means to be a Christian. You can't bear somebody else's burden unless you are taking something of their load and it's weighing you down a little bit.","Churches that should be talking about the work of Christ on the cross and the grace of God for sinners are stuck on recycled pop psychology, moral exhortation, or entertainment. But these fail to speak to the eternal question that haunts all of us: 'How do I know that I'm OK?' We all want to know we are justified.","At the heart of the Protestant faith is the conviction that there is nothing we contribute to our salvation but our sin, no merit we bring but Christ's, and nothing necessary for justification except faith alone.","Growing up in Michigan, I can't think of anything so explicitly communicated to me in my whole education experience as the vileness of in-your-face racism.","We were taught in school, and I was taught at home and in church, that blacks and whites were equal and we should not discriminate based on skin color, even if my school was almost entirely white.","Publicly leading a church in prayer deserves thoughtful preparation.","Don't just ask God for what we want. Let him teach us what we should want."],"Kevin Dillon":["I just always loved pinball.","I was called Matt Dillon's brother my whole career basically until 'Entourage' broke me free of that and now people call me Johnny Drama instead.","I'm a big fan of comedians not having to apologize for anything. Nowadays it seems comedians are always apologizing for being funny.","It's hard to walk down the street without 'Entourage' comments, and that's all nice.","I've learned how to make a nice souffle, a little mac and cheese.","I have to do so many scenes cooking that I wanted to learn how to chop like I know what I'm doing and do certain things around the kitchen that look right.","People wouldn't hire me for comedies. They would say, 'Oh, he doesn't do comedy,' and now it's really all I do.","I thought I'd miss cursing, but I actually don't. I still feel like I can get my point across without real harsh language.","I've got plenty of advice from a number of other actors. Me? I don't give advice.","I really enjoy acting. I feel I'm getting better and better with each movie I make.","In 'War Party,' I play a quarter-breed Indian. It's a serious movie, but it's funny, too.","Before 'Entourage,' I couldn't get a sitcom.","I love the Discovery Channel, man!","I wouldn't mind having a nice little restaurant.","I think oysters are overrated, and I don't love the texture.","I live out here in Malibu, where I can see the stars. So I want to get a really nice telescope so I can look at the stars a little bit more.","The moment when you find out when you shoot the pilot - getting the pilot is a small victory. You shoot the pilot, and when you get picked up, that's a huge victory right there.","I guess Tom Cruise - everything he does, everything he touches, is kind of a success.","I don't go out that often. I'm not going to clubs or anything.","I know a lot of really good actors - tons, just tons - who I still don't know why they don't work all the time because they're that good. It's just a weird business, and I know a lot of actors who shouldn't be working, but they work all the time.","I enjoy fatherhood.","I have great tenants. They've all become my friends. They call me and say, 'Hey Kev, we've got a drip!'","I do real estate.","I was a class clown, but I'm not a bully.","I'm a good Catholic - most of the time.","I like everything about acting.","I was hoping to attend the School of Visual Arts and had a portfolio built up.","The character of Johnny Drama was a lot of fun to play.","I'm kind of a homebody.","My brother Paul's really kind of obsessive, and he obsesses over things.","I don't know, scene stealing is something I see as, people look at it, it could be a positive thing, but I really like to think of myself as a team player. It's kind of like one player can make the other teammates better, kind of like Larry Byrd dishing off.","I'll spend time playing 'Call of Duty' and 'Medal of Honor.'","I'm an old guy, so I started out playing 'Pong' with my brothers, and 'Mario Bros.' and whatnot. But we really got involved and got intense when 'Tecmo Super Bowl' came out. That's when we really started playing video games, and it got intense.","I'm kind of new to the racing game thing. I've always been, like, a shooter game kind of guy.","I've always wanted an old Vette... like, a '67 Stingray is the car I'd want.","I've been dying to go to India, especially to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. I've also heard Bollywood town's a lot of fun!","Everything that happens on 'Entourage' does happen in Hollywood.","I've done a lot of movies before 'Entourage,' and I hope to always have my movie career going. Maybe I could take on another TV show, too.","I gotta lot of Black Irish in me.","I think I look pretty decent in a tux.","I'm kind of a jeans and T-shirt guy.","I might be into writing... I'd like to try it someday. I always come up with some good ideas.","I don't like to get involved in any bashing at all."],"Kevin Dunn":["I majored in theater in college. I did a couple of plays in high school, and I really enjoyed it, so I went to Illinois Wesleyan University and got a degree, and then I went back to Chicago and started doing theater in all the companies around the city for about 11 years before I moved out to L.A.","I love Brian De Palma.","You read the stories about horses being starved at Santa Anita, but a horse can't starve at Santa Anita! I mean, there's just bags of carrots all over the place; food is everywhere. They don't starve any horses!","I don't think I auditioned for 'Ghostbusters II'.","Strictly by the nature of 'Veep,' in any given moment, a lot can go wrong.","I'm not from that world where you get on your feet and somebody gives you a suggestion and you improv your way through things.","On a film, they'll always say there's going to be a rehearsal period, and there never is."],"Kevin Durand":["A lot of my friends growing up were hunters, but I spent all my time on the ice hurting actual humans playing hockey. I never had the chance to run through the woods and shoot at a moose or deer. I was shooting pucks at goaltender's heads.","I was a hockey player growing up. Being a big guy and being imposing, I had to use my size to protect my teammates.","As an actor, I've been all over the map, but since I've moved to Hollywood, people tend to cast me in these more imposing characters, which is actually really fun for me. I've always been way more attracted to playing that than the hero.","I'm always excited to carry more and more weight and responsibility within a story.","I did stand-up for a long time, and I did classical theater. As much time as you could spend on a stage will always inform you and your job, as you evolve. I feel the freedom of being able to find comedy in the darkest moments because it makes it way more interesting, I think.","I cook some damn good eggs!","I started off as a rapper from Thunder Bay, Ontario, believe it or not. There was a little group of 10 or 12 of us that would get together and copy each other's cassettes. So I was a rapper first, and it was that music that got me into this great entertainment world and got me out of Thunder Bay.","I think the first villain that I ever played was on 'Stargate'. I was this superior being that would take over a human host and believe that he was the most superior being in the universe."],"Kevin Durant":["I just loved being in the gym. It was tough at times. Sometimes I wanted to quit, but I'm glad I stuck with it.","I'm a basketball player. That's what I do and what I love but that's just not all who I am. I'm talented in a lot of different areas.","I don't know what I'm going to do tomorrow. I just know for sure I'm going to keep playing basketball.","With everything I do, I just try to be myself.","I'm busy working on every aspect of my game - defense, shooting, rebounding - but I really want to become a better overall team player. Help my teammates become better players out on the court in order to win more ball games.","My time is now.","I always want to win because I never want to sit out on the sidelines outside.","I was just a big fan of tattoos always growing up, and I wanted something cool that symbolizes what I've been through in my life, and everything on my chest and my back is like a collage.","Everything has been such a whirlwind ever since I stepped foot in the league and everything has been like a dream, so I'm just blessed to be in this position.","I'm an old-school type of guy.","I would describe my style as off the wall. I like stuff that doesn't match. I just like to stand out.","I'm just trying to grow. That's one thing I told myself is, 'Don't worry about who people say is the best player.'","I just want to grow spiritually with the Lord. I'm keeping strong at it, just trying to make my walk with faith a little better.","My acting coach I've got here, Richard Lawson, he's been doing good, just telling me to calm down sometimes and just be me.","I've got a long way to go to being the ultimate best, but I think my time is now. And I'm starting to enter my prime.","When people are used to you doing something, they want you to stay in that lane.","The clothes are not making me... If I like it, that's all that matters...It's not about the clothes. It's about how I am as a person and how confident I am.","I feel good doing it. It's not like guys are stripping me at half-court or I'm just losing the ball dribbling. I think I'm handling the ball pretty well, just trying to make good passes, man.","You hear all these stories about, 'There's one in a million guys that make it to the NBA and stay there.' To see people cheering for me and when they say my name, it's just crazy. It's still crazy to me.","I look at my jersey and see the NBA logo, I'm like, 'I didn't think I'd be here.'","My style has changed and evolved mainly because I've grown to have more confidence in myself.","I'm not a guy that's going to brag or feel like I'm better than the group.","You know, I think more people should watch women's basketball. It'd do so much for the game.","I can score the basketball, but I think I can pass pretty well or I can make the correct pass. I'm not the type of guy who's just going to throw the ball inbounds to a guy who's wide open. I can make the right pass.","Every memory I had growing up was involving a basketball. I didn't go to the prom and stuff like that. It was always basketball for me.","My mom just wants to make sure that my heart is always in whatever I do and I'm in things for the right reasons.","You know, I don't want to stand out too much.","I've just got to let my teammates know in practice, without even telling them, that I don't think I'm ahead of anybody.","I feel as though I've proved myself these last five years that I can be one of the top players in the league.","I've heard a few times, in three or four years, this league is going to be yours. I don't like that. Because I think I'm established now.","I Tweeted Keri Hilson the other day and she actually wrote back! I was so excited.","I like something simple and traditional, like dinner and a movie. The best way to get to know someone is to have a conversation over dinner. And steak houses have a nice atmosphere - the lights are dim, and they usually have a band playing.","People always think women meet us in the hotel lobby, but it's the opposite. The majority of the time, you go out to eat with your teammates, then rest for the next day's game. It's not a vacation - most guys view the road as a business trip.","I like women's basketball.","I learned how to pass when I was real young. That's one thing I always knew how to do was find the open man."],"Kevin Eubanks":["Inspiration is one thing and you can't control it, but hard work is what keeps the ship moving. Good luck means, work hard. Keep up the good work.","I really live a simple life and don't need very much to feel good and happy. Don't get me wrong; I believe you should get what you earn. Sometimes you have to fight for it.","My love life doesn't stink; it's nonexistent.","I am blessed to have Mom and Dad.","The simple things in life ground me and keep me focused so I'm able to do a good job with what is in front of me.","I want someone who is open-minded, dedicated to whatever she is doing and isn't afraid to say I love you. As for looks, she shouldn't have three heads. I want a regular human being.","Being as versatile as I am, I take offense to the notion that no serious musician would not be doing a late night talk show gig. One has to be open enough in other areas to be able to contribute to a show like this.","My love life is like everyone else's - great, and then terrible.","Sometimes I wonder if I got lulled into not wanting things because I grew up black in this country.","After a while I thought it didn't make any sense to use a pick. It's kind of like typing with one finger on each hand instead of using all your fingers.","Dad made it to Gold Shield Detective, so he always busted Robin, my oldest brother, and me. Always got caught, whatever we were doing.","I can pay my rent now. I guess I could always do that, but now I can get an apartment with heat.","I consider myself a serious musician. Doing a comedy show does not take away from that in any way.","I feel very honored to be playing with Bill Pierce. He's such a great musician.","I had the fortunate experience to play with people from different schools of music. Sam Rivers is from the fundamentalist school of music.","I love both my parents dearly.","I really worked with icons in the music business, which really had a strong effect on me. It wasn't just pick-up gigs.","I think Wes Montgomery is the greatest jazz guitarist that ever lived.","I thought people cared about music in a deep way, so I was writing to that spirit in people and in myself. It was me, thinking I knew what was up. Youth, who else can change the world?","I was playing violin for a long time, about 6 years. It takes a while. You need very patient people in your house when you have a violin.","I wish I could sing. I love singers, but I am way too shy. Scares the hell out of me.","If you play jazz, then you play with your fingers. If you're playing rock, you use a pick. There's really no rhyme or reason to that other than that's just the way it has been.","In most places that are rich in guitar culture, everyone uses their fingers, like in Spain or Africa. In Japan there are string instruments played that way. It is not until you get in the States that you find people using picks.","It is hard for a black man to just be himself. We spend so much time in defense of something that is indefensible because there is nothing to defend.","It's shameful what's happening in this country in terms of what we deny our children.","James Brown is the reason I play guitar.","People see my current success but don't realize I've worked hard to get where I am. I used to clean garbage off the Philadelphia docks and put a lot of time into developing my music.","Serious musicians are finding it harder and harder to have a voice in the world of music these days.","The belief that we are what the media says we are, what people perceive we are, is soon to be what we think we are. We are treated based on this warped perception. It is hard to get away from it.","The things I really learned, I learned from watching my parents. They take care of business. Always have.","The worst part is doubt. When you doubt yourself, which we are taught to do, you get lost."],"Kevin Federline":["I'm happy. I don't care what other people say or think. I'm happy. I'm blessed. I'm proud of my life, and that's it. That's all that matters.","I'll always dance for fun, but for work? I've done it, dude.","Co-parenting is going great with Britney. The schedule has been worked out over time, and we talk when we need to. It's always about the boys - mostly school stuff - and we make sure we stay on top of that. It's going great.","The more I talk, the more I come out and people get to know who I am and what I'm about, it's only gonna help. And if you don't like me, hey, cool. Everything in life is 50/50. I accept the good and the bad and just move on.","Once you get depressed, you don't really feel like doing anything. You're kind of discouraged about yourself, and then the weight gain, too, or that makes me more depressed.","I'm learning what I gotta do to get people hyped up. It doesn't matter even if they're not dancing, as long as they're bobbing their head and as long as it looks like a mosh pit down there.","It's hard enough to be in a marriage and then have a kid, then kids: it changes everything.","I never thought that I would get married, but it wound up happening. That was a really, really happy, exciting moment.","If I was very high-strung, I probably would've knocked a few people out by now, and, you know, you would have seen a bad side of me that probably, hopefully, I'll never show.","You have to put your kids first no matter what; that's how I feel.","My ex Shar tried to hide me, but Britney was proud to be with me. I have so many great memories that outweigh the bad.","Britney proposing to me on a plane three months after we met, and getting married two months later was just us living in the moment. I really thought I'd spend the rest of my life with her.","Britney and I are on the same page. There are no grudges. We communicate on disciplining the kids, and if they're grounded here, they're grounded there. She's a completely different person - as the kids will tell you!","Hey, I don't drink or go wild anymore, but I can still be the life of the party.","You have to have an overall vision of how you want people to see you.","I love being onstage, whether it's dancing or acting - there's just something about being onstage.","The paparazzi and the press have given me a voice. No matter how I got the voice, it's there.","I'm just going to be as honest as I can with my children and really try to build their character to be as strong as ours is.","I've made a couple of comments about fame, and my kids are going to be put in - in, you know, working at Taco Bell when they're 16 so they know what a real job is like, and - and know what it's like to - to really earn money."],"Kevin Feige":["Rejection is a common occurrence. Learning that early and often will help you build up the tolerance and resistance to keep going and keep trying.","We try to keep audiences coming back in greater numbers by doing the unexpected and not simply following a pattern or a mold or a formula.","What other people are adapting from the comics medium, I watch with as much interest as I do any other movies. Because I'm a fan, and I want to see what other people are doing in the world.","I'd argue that the term 'superhero' is much too broadly used.","I'm always worried about overhype. I love underhype.","One thing that brings me great, great joy is reading the reviews of 'Civil War' and seeing the much deserved credit that Chris Evans is getting for his performance as Captain America.","A very high bar has been set with Robert Downey in 'Iron Man.' That idea was, find the best actor for the part, regardless of whether they've been in a movie like this before.","All of the Marvel characters have flaws to them; all of them have a deep humanity to them.","I've always believed in expanding the definition of what a Marvel Studios movie could be.","The best thing about being a film producer is I get to spend 99 per cent of my time behind the scenes.","It's true that once a year I travel to Comic-Con... but there I can quickly lower the lights; I can show them the clips, introduce a few stars. And the spotlight is quickly off me.","I'm not sure that 'Iron Man' is a superhero movie. I think towards the end of the movie, Iron Man pretends to be a superhero - he's entertained by that notion. I think 'X-Men' is a sci-fi movie.","From a financial perspective, you have to think about what the film will generate in revenue so you can set a budget against it.","You can drive yourself crazy and tie yourself in knots trying to anticipate what someone's going to like or not like, and doing test screenings and opinion polls. But pay too much mind to that, and you'll wind up with a big pile of mush.","I had admired the way the producers of the 'Harry Potter' franchise had found David Yates, who ended up doing their four final movies, and he'd come from television.","In the case of 'Thor,' it was just casting the best people for the part. Ken Branagh had the idea to cast Idris Elba as Heimdall, and we didn't blink at that chance to do it.","We want to see a Joss Whedon 'Batgirl' film be awesome.","Humor is the secret into the audience's other ranges of emotions.","We always set out to just make a great movie.","We said, as we were developing 'Iron Man 1,' and working on these films, that our characters need to be as interesting out of their costumes as they are inside their costumes, fighting and flying around.","'Guardians Of The Galaxy' was, as 'Ant-Man' was, just fun, in terms of expanding this universe. We always say, how can we keep audiences surprise at what an MCU film can be?","Chris Evans has embodied Captain America as well as any actor has ever embodied an iconic pop-culture figure like that. I go back to Chris Reeve as Superman as the gold standard, and I think Evans is right there.","'X-Men 1' - I did a cameo.","Every time we make a movie, 'Guardians' included, 'Black Panther' included, 'Infinity War' included, we just feel lucky to be making that movie, and that's basically what the focus is on.","'Iron Man' and 'Iron Man 2' are as Jon Favreau films as you can see.","Kenneth Branagh has his stamp all over 'Thor.'","'Captain America: First Avenger' is very much a Joe Johnston film."],"Kevin Frazier":["Whether it's standing backstage with Jennifer Lopez in a dress that I know everyone will be talking about tomorrow... or being there when incredible news breaks, and instead where people sit in front of their TVs and look at it, I'm the person who goes there to bring you the story... It's amazing. It's unbelievable.","Entertainment shows make a living on behind-the-scenes stuff that can now be doled out socially. When we see it, we're like, 'Uh oh.'","I had a great bond with my father. Even when I was a kid, my bond with my dad made me want to be a father myself one day.","Talking through troubles, staying calm in the face of adversity, that's what my father taught me. It's an invaluable lesson because there's no shortage of adversity and mistakes to be dealt with.","My first son Tony was born when I was only eighteen. I was a still a kid; I wasn't ready to be a dad, so he was put up for adoption and went off to live with a family that could care for him.","A lot of reporters don't have conversations - they just fire off questions. I'm going to listen to what you're saying. If you start giving me a pat answer, I'm going to challenge you. That's where my sports background helps, because athletes do it all the time. So you have to stop them... and sometimes they're going to yell back at you. So what?","I really enjoy encountering a celebrity who's like, 'Let's go; you'd better have your A-game on.' You sit down with Madonna, and she's like, 'You'd better have something for me. If you're not ready to dance, I'll eat you up.'","Angelina Jolie, Tom Cruise, and Will Smith are hall-of-famers. When they hit the red carpet, they know exactly what they're going to do, how they're going to do it. Damn, they're good.","I love to watch 'Hoarders.' My grandmother was a hoarder. My mother's on her way. I'm an electronics hoarder - I won't throw any out. I still have my first T-Mobile Sidekick... old VCRs in my garage. It scares me that I'm going to end up being buried under electronics.","I was in the tent when Bobbi Kristina's body was lowered into the ground. Watching her grandmother and her aunt, watching these women not cry but wail - you can't divorce your feelings from some of this stuff.","If more people got involved with their local schools, if more companies donated money, a lot of the problems that are plaguing our schools and our youth would disappear."],"Kevin Garnett":["At the end of the day, you're responsible for yourself and your actions and that's all you can control. So rather than be frustrated with what you can't control, try to fix the things you can.","Playing video games is something I enjoy in my spare time. I'm a gamer, always have been.","'Modern Warfare,' 'Black Ops,' these are all the next level of video games. The people are more detailed, the fighting is more exact, and I can't speak for every gamer out there, but I know when I play, I feel like I'm actually in the game. It's that intense.","I have a problem sometimes with being too hyper.","I don't play to sweat, I play to win.","I'm not the type of person to give up just because something gets rough. That's a coward. That's not me.","There are a lot of things that frustrate me. I get frustrated when I have to wait at a red light.","Some of my friends snowmobile. I'm a little scared of it.","I don't think anything less than perfect, even though I'm a human being. The way I work and go at things is to better myself in perfect terms.","We have to do the impossible, but it is possible.","I'm not for the flashes; I'm not for glitz and glamour, you know. I just want to win, I want to be good at what I do, um, and look back upon these days of playing in the NBA.","Sometimes when I hear commentating, it's sickening. People who never played the game, people who never played in the league have an opinion, and that's all it is. You are here to educate the watcher or the viewer. Sometimes it comes off as personal. I don't ever want to come off like that. My opinion is my opinion about someone.","I'm from the bottom, I understand what it's like to have and to not have. My perception on giving is to put yourself in those people's shoes and go from there. So that's what I did.","I learned one thing - never hate a positive option.","Coaching takes patience. I'm more enthused when teaching players who want it versus when I have to.","I'm very simple. I'm not for the flashes, I'm not for glitz and glamour, you know.","Too much coffee. Too much coffee and Gatorade. It's a hell of a mix. If you're ever tired in the morning, just try that mix, and tell me what you think.","The last couple of practices, all we've been doing is a lot of defensive things. We've been going over some drills that make all of us have to communicate.","Kev has these old Boston drills, where you all have to talk to each other, and interact, and it's helped us.","The beautiful thing about when you go through a slide is that you learn from it. Not just saying that you learn from it, but applying the things that you have learned.","So we take a lot of pride in that. It's really on us to turn this thing around. I think this last month we've done just that. We've pointed ourself in the direction that we want to be, and I think we're starting to head towards that. Right now we're in a nice rhythm.","Going from Flip to Kev, obviously you don't want to see someone ever lose their job. For me it's probably a little more difficult, because other than Bill Blair, Flip is all I knew.","So you're dealing with a coach, and you're dealing with a guy who's actually experienced NBA basketball from a player's perspective and actually goes about it that way.","We know that in order for us to turn this around, it doesn't matter how many coaches they bring in here, assistants, weight trainers, whoever, we're the ones that are going to have turn it around. And I think just took that responsibility on ourselves.","I would love to see Flip get back into the league. I think he can definitely still coach in this league. I think he will be in this league quicker than sooner.","It's scary when one day the city is there and the next day it's gone. To see the water actual kill people, I couldn't believe it. I never fathomed it could bury a city.","Performance is something we all strive to be better at. I'm no different than that. Who wants to look bad?","Sometimes when I hear commentating, it's sickening. People who never played the game, people who never played in the league have an opinion, and that's all it is. You are here to educate the watcher or the viewer. Sometimes it comes off as personal.","I've never been an individual guy. I never cared about the accolades. I've always been driven by the competition and the learning process.","I'm not someone who is going to give in to a lot of pressure. I've always understood that everything is not always going to be good.","I can't control if people like me; I can't control if people like my game."],"Kevin Gates":["When you stand for something, you've got to stand for it all the way, not half way.","True wealth is not of the pocket, but of the heart and of the mind.","I suffer from deep depression, so my only release is music.","If you look at the movie 'Belly,' I identify with Sincere the most. I am a gangster. I love my lady to death. I'm not in the game for the wrong reasons. I'm not in the game for the glory. I'm in the game to survive so the people that I love could be straight. I'm a highly intelligent individual.","I adapt and I adjust to whatever environment I'm in.","Coming up in the streets, I had to learn how to read people early on. I'm a very analytical person. I observe a lot of the things that people don't notice.","Glory be and praise to God. I didn't do any of this. God did. I don't have a recipe or a blueprint. I prayed for it, and my prayers are continuing to be answered.","Sometimes I feel like being an intellectual. Sometimes I like to just be aggressive and all the way in my feelings. Sometimes I might be emotional, or sometimes I might drag on the track and be lazy. I just like to share the different states of existence of Kevin Gates with the rest of the world.","Life is about conduct and how we conduct ourselves. But two wrongs never make a right.","I don't let the left hand know what the right hand is doing.","I attended college in prison. I was in jail, so there ain't no going to no classes. They have programs in certain facilities where you can earn good time, and then you get time taken off your sentence. But as far as going to classes, it's not like that. You study, and then an administrator gives you a test. I got a Master's in psychology.","I don't really like talking. I like to execute. I'm not a talking person. I'm an action person.","I don't want no handouts. I want to get it out the mud.","I look at other people's lives, and some people feel like they're too old to play with toys. But I still go through the toy section at the store, 'cause there were toys that I wanted when I was little that I couldn't have. So I still get them.","I like being with my family. That's my party.","I put my flaws on front street. So the world accepted my flaws, so I don't have any flaws.","I don't believe in conspiracy theories. I'm just a cold-blooded investigator.","I never go into a situation with any type of expectations.","I'm not afraid to make mistakes.","I've always been a loner.","I don't sleep much. I don't sleep much - I work, I work, I work.","I really don't pay attention to the outside world when I'm incarcerated, because being in prison is like being in a different world. So I don't pay attention to what's going on outside of jail, because it's all beyond my control.","I did study religion for a little while. I studied the Torah and the Holy Koran, Helios Biblos, which is considered by most people to be the Holy Bible. I just wanted to know, even with Buddhism and the Dalai Llama.","I was born on a full moon. Both my children were born on full moons, too. Some people say that's scary. It is what it is, man, I don't be trippin'. I couldn't tell God when I wanted to be born.","Biggie Smalls, Jay-Z, Nas, Eminem, Big L, Tupac. That was, like, my top five, generally.","I'm an introvert somewhat. There could be a room full of people, I'll go stand in the corner.","My skin is 24 karat gold when a sun hit it.","The more I grow in popularity, the lonelier it gets. Because you don't really know me. You just know this part of me. You fell in love with that. But it's way more intricate than what meets the surface.","I have trouble with letting go. That's my problem.","I have trust issues with allowing other individuals to know my innermost secrets for fear of how I may be viewed. Everyone has this.","I always knew who I was, and I always ran from my true purpose... I know what my job is. And I always ran from it.","I just always wanted to study human behavior because every psychologist that I would talk to would tell me I was bipolar, and I know I'm not bipolar, so I had to perform a psychoanalysis on myself to find out that I have unresolved grief.","I was born in Earl K. Long Hospital. I was born Feb. 5th, 1986. I have a lot of family members. My grandmother had five girls, and all of them had children. It was always a house full. A lot of cousins. A lot of family members.","I always had music growing up, but music was also like a journal. It was like my personal diary or personal journal. A lot of the things I couldn't express to an individual, I would express them in my music.","I was always taught not to answer no questions. I'm not really good at answering them because I get agitated so fast.","I married my best friend that happens to be a girl.","I'm never on Twitter. I'm never on Instagram. And that's not by choice: it's just that those things never really interested me. I might post a picture here and there, but that ain't really been my focus.","I'm a bookworm. I know with my physical appearance that I don't look like the typical reader. I'm in Barnes & Noble all the time, and you can look at people that look like they are supposed to be in there. I am in there, pants sagging, hat backwards.","I used to really love Fiend, but he stopped. He just stopped. Every time he had a project, every project - 'There's One In Every Family,' 'Street Life' - I had to have them. And he just stopped. And that was disappointing, 'cause that was my favorite rapper at one time.","Prison was the best thing that ever happened to me.","It's a curse. I ask God to take this away from me all the time. I do not like being an artist.","One of my most popular songs, 'Satellites,' I paid $300 for that beat on SoundClick.","I could give a flying flip about doing promo because, no disrespect, nobody put me in the position that I'm in.","I don't know how the rap game is, because I'm a fan of reality, and the rap game's entertainment.","I'm not no Internet person.","I'm super serious about music. That's, like, the only thing I'm serious about.","'Recreative' is a word that I invented because in urban culture, with colloquialism, we invent so many slangs. I don't like the way that 'recreational' sounds - I don't like to say I do a lot of 'recreational' reading. I like to say that I read 'recreatively.' I do a lot of 'recreative' reading.","Rap was more of a release for me, a journal.","What I see, what I went through, what a friend of mine may have went through, whatever - I rap about it.","I like Peter Tosh, Bob Marley of course. All of Capleton, Sizzla, Frisco Kid, Buju Banton.","When you're in prison, you want to know that you were thought about.","I always wanted a family.","In 7th grade, I believe, I wrote my first rap song. It was about everything I was seeing, everything that was going on around me.","I'm a felon. I get pulled over all the time.","Man, all lives matter.","I've just always been a reader.","I think California has the best energy.","I've had mixtapes that have been better than albums I've heard from other artists. I take my time; I put my heart into it.","The only frustrating thing about jail is that I can't make music.","I used to live with my grandmother. I used to wonder why the other kids in school went home with their mothers and fathers. I wanted to be the guy that got married. I wanted to be the guy with the children and the white picket fence. I never had that.","Marriage is the most wonderful thing ever.","I could care less about the particular. I like to make music.","I was doing sold-out shows before I got radio play.","I'm glad I can't vote.","I don't just listen to rap.","I have a cult-like following because I exemplify what it is to be a human being.","Let me tell you something about Tunechi - about that boy. That boy comes to the studio every day and grind as if he doesn't have a dollar in his pocket."],"Kevin Harrington":["I have seen entrepreneurs ask for hundreds of millions of dollars on a concept and try to sell because of 'their passion' for an idea. If the idea is that good, why wouldn't I cut you out and hire someone who is just as passionate for much, much less?","Nothing turns off an investor more than when an entrepreneur comes in with a ridiculous valuation.","I understand that finance can be very complex.","People must be realistic when evaluating their business.","By definition startups usually do not turn a profit.","I've spent over 25 years in the television industry, the direct response industry. I met a lot of people and certainly learned the power of commercials and their brand building potential.","Reality TV is a totally different animal than the infomercial world."],"Kevin Hart":["Everybody wants to be famous, but nobody wants to do the work. I live by that. You grind hard so you can play hard. At the end of the day, you put all the work in, and eventually it'll pay off. It could be in a year, it could be in 30 years. Eventually, your hard work will pay off.","Laughter heals all wounds, and that's one thing that everybody shares. No matter what you're going through, it makes you forget about your problems. I think the world should keep laughing.","The two things in the world we all share in this world are laughter and pain. We've all got problems. The levels of those problems vary, but we've all got problems. When you can take things that are painful and make them funny, that's a gift - to you and your audience.","It's a well-known fact that tall people are evil.","No matter what, people grow. If you chose not to grow, you're staying in a small box with a small mindset. People who win go outside of that box. It's very simple when you look at it.","I am who I am. That's why my friends and peers respect and appreciate me. I don't change or cater my actions to fit my surroundings. I'm myself 24/7. People appreciate that.","My main goal is to be a self-made man and have control over what's mine.","The original 'About Last Night' was phenomenal.","I don't want enemies. I want friends, and I want them in all shapes, sizes, and colors, and loving whoever they want to.","The quote-unquote 'description' of a leading man was once your tall, handsome man with the build of whatever, almost a trophy to some degree. I think now it's about making a leading man what you want a leading man to be. In this day, you can't deny talent. You look at Jonah Hill, you look at Zach Galifianakis, you look at myself.","Some people love so hard that they can't control those emotions when they're at their deepest point.","The day you stop doing the small things is the day you think you're above everybody else.","In my divorce, I stood up and said to my ex-wife, 'Hey, I messed up. This had nothing to do with you. I didn't understand what marriage was. I cheated. I was wrong. We couldn't fix it; it got worse. I stepped away because I didn't want it to get any worse. You're the mother of my kids - I don't want to hate you.'","A reputation as a hard worker is a good reputation to have.","Some sarcasm is best told simply.","I think if someone gets kicked in the face it is their fault - they watched the foot come towards their face.","I'm a Buffalo wing magnet, a sandwich fanatic, a cheesesteak guy. But I'll only get a cheesesteak in Philadelphia. No one else does it right.","I can honestly say, after talking about my mom passing away, I got the biggest weight off of my chest. Comedy is my therapy. That's how I deal with my problems, my personal battles. I talk about it. I give it to my fans. When they laugh at it, it's a release, for lack of a better word.","Stand-up can take you in so many different places, man. So many doors can be opened up from stand-up comedy, and the first one that was opened up for me was acting. But you can go from acting to being a TV personality to being a radio personality to being a writer to being a producer, to just being a visionary, to voiceover work.","My success comes in making fun of whatever you're doing. That's my way.","Believe it or not, I make myself laugh. Sometimes when I have thoughts or say some things that are funny, it just makes me laugh, and I don't mind laughing at it before you guys do.","You see some of the weirdest people in Detroit casinos.","I love soft-cotton white T-shirts.","I never do anything that I don't want to do.","At the end of the day, your fans are the people who support you in and out. And their opinions matter.","I don't care how busy I am - I will always make time for what's most important to me.","If you look at me close enough, there's a small resemblance to a chicken nugget. I don't know if it's my skin texture or my hair, but the resemblance is definitely there.","I don't write material. Funny things happen to me in the course of a day, and I just make notes.","You get one life. I'm going to embrace mine.","I stayed true to my dreams and, eventually, they came true.","Being humble matters.","I know a dramatic role is going to happen, but you just got to be patient, you know? It's going to happen when it's supposed to happen. I'm not rushing it. I'm not trying to make it happen tomorrow.","I like playing basketball and going to the gym. I don't box, but I'll ride my bike and go jogging or running in the park. Sometimes my lady and I go hiking.","I was probably tall as a child, but I just stopped growing.","Men are like lions. We hunt.","The second time around, I'll understand that, as a husband, my wife doesn't care about my opinions. I just need to tell her the things that will continue to help me stack the brownie points.","No man wants to settle down. It happens. Eventually you're going to bump into somebody that makes you go, 'Hmm, I don't mind seeing this person every day.'","I didn't work hard to sit down and not work.","I can get where some scientists would say comedians are crazy. What you have to understand: A lot of comedians are dealing with a dark passion. A lot of these are guys coming from a tumultuous life, including myself. Some people need outlets, a way to express yourself.","I love diversity.","There was one incident at a movie theater where my girl got mad at these guys who were talking behind us. I never looked back there, but she was like, 'Will you all just shut up!' And I just got up and moved three rows in front. She was like, 'What are you doing?!' I was like, 'You better get up here! I don't play the fighting games.'","Everything is an open book. I don't speak on other people's hardship, but if it happened in my life or something that has been an experience on my particular journey, I'm going to talk about it. That's what my fan base appreciates the most. I'm universal. You can relate to the things I say or that I go through.","I am who I am today because of my mother.","People don't want to hear about me having leather walls or gold toilets.","The funny thing is, all my friends are short. I wasn't aware of tall people till I got to high school. I didn't know they existed. I was sheltered.","I don't see how people are comfortable with seeing other people be great. You can be happy for anybody, but what is your excuse to not want to be great? These people are great because they just say, 'I'ma do that,' and they do it. That's it. There's no scientifical process.","When people get married young, you don't really understand the true definition of marriage.","Some people are jerks, and some people aren't.","People like to hear the word 'love.'","An unemployed court jester is nobody's fool.","I'm a whopping 5 foot 4 inches tall. I'm not going to get any taller.","As a producer, as a CEO of Hartbeat Productions, I am making deals to put my company in place to win, to put my staff to work so that while all this stuff is going on, they're in the kitchen cooking. So it's understanding the longevity of the entertainment business; you get out of it what you put into it.","I don't know about other people, but I love to work.","Everybody that's successful lays a blueprint out.","My experiences in life are getting bigger and better. The more stuff I do, the more stuff I talk about - having kids, traveling, going through relationship problems, dealing with things in my own family. All that stuff builds character.","Because I'm small, I've been called things from 'Happy Feet' to 'Little Face.'","On 'Think Like a Man,' they got the best out of me because they allowed me to bring my own cadences and opinions to the character that I was playing. I think we got the best of that particular character.","Comedy's about opening up and being unique, but to a point where the audience can relate to what you're saying.","My kids are coming up in a different time then me. Interracial couples are of the norm. With me, it's about making sure my kids understand the importance of education and having opportunities that I didn't. My goal as a parent is to make sure they don't take what they have for granted.","'Best Man Holiday' was a very successful film.","I've turned down shows offering large amounts of money.","At the end of the day, women are a distraction. Whether you realize it or not.","I am an angel. I was sent here from God to heal.","Before I look stupid and not know what a word means or how to pronounce it, I'll stop the whole production: 'Hey, real quick, guys. Define this word for me. Somebody.'","I love making people laugh. And I love laughing.","A lot of blood, sweat, and tears have gone into this career of mine.","Hollywood has a way of making everything seem like an overnight success.","I think women go crazy for a reason. It's not like it just happens.","My goals are so high that I don't have time to relax in any way, shape or form.","I think the whole stigma of 'black movies' is slowly being lost. When you look at movies like '12 Years A Slave,' to 'The Butler,' to 'The Best Man,' to 'Ride Along,' to even 'Think Like a Man' from last year - these movies are just good movies.","Oh, my mama was awesome. Very strict, overreligious, loved the Lord, loved rules. But she had to be that way because of where we were growing up, the neighborhood I was from.","When you're doing a film and the majority of the film is cast black, for me, it's most important to get people to view those movies as just movies, as just good movies. At the end of the day, regardless of the color of the cast, we're all doing the same thing in this business: trying to make a good film.","The thing about impressing your girlfriend is that when you do something like a private island in Fiji, it's all downhill from that point.","I performed in a bowling alley before while people were still bowling. Cut the check, and I will perform anywhere.","I get that racism exists, but it's not a catalyst for my content. I don't need to talk about race to have material. My style of comedy is more self-deprecating. I think that makes me more relatable. When you deal with 'topics' - race, white versus black - you're not separating from the pack. You're doing what everybody else is doing.","I had a great time being a salesman because of the pitches that I gave when I was selling shoes. However, I don't think I'm as well versed in shoes as I am in comedy. Being a salesman was all about being a people person, and I enjoy being around people. I also love talking to people - which is why I think I did so well.","My business acumen is definitely growing.","At the end of the day, I want to be part of the same conversation as Chris Rock, Eddie Murphy, Dave Chappelle, Bill Cosby and Richard Pryor.","I feel like I have a job to do, like I constantly have to reinvent myself. The more I up the ante for myself, the better it is in the long run. I try to interact with my fans as much as possible. It's good that the person I'm being onstage isn't really an act. It's really me.","Here's the thing. We do a movie with a predominantly black cast, and it's put in a category of being a black film. When other movies are done with a predominantly white cast, we don't call them a white film. I'm trying to remove the stigma off things they call black films.","I'm not the most attractive fella. I'm not a Billy Dee Williams. Personality is everything.","My dad was never married. He was kind of a rolling stone. But he was never disrespectful. At the same time, even though he had women in his life when I was a kid, there wasn't any consistency.","I've done auditions where the casting director is taking the paper out of my hand in the middle of reading.","My show 'The Big House' was picked up; they flew me to New York. I'm about to step on stage to announce Kevin Hart's 'The Big House.' And a hand grabs my shoulder, 'Kevin no, they just decided to cancel it.' It's a serious smack-in-the-face business, and either you can take it, or you can't.","Any hand that I've shaken, any person that I met when I was Joe Blow, now that I'm this guy Kevin Hart, has come back. That's why I treat everybody with respect. I'm always a nice pleasant guy to meet because when they come back to you, they remember.","I understand that being able to appeal to the public and having an amazing sense of humour is not something that comes easy. It's definitely a gift and for which I'm thankful.","I've done a great job at being universal in my stand-up, which is why, for 'Let Me Explain,' I toured all over the world. These movies I have coming out - 'Ride Along,' 'Grudge Match,' 'About Last Night,' 'Think Like a Man Too' - are putting me in a position to become universal on an even bigger scale.","I don't take pictures when I'm with my kids, for the sake of my kids. It's important when you're as busy as I am that you give your kids your time when you're with them, and nothing compromises that. I've been lucky enough to have fans that understand that.","I am capable of holding the quote-unquote 'title' of leading man. Leading man just means people want to see you and assume that you can hold a film, carry a movie.","The same thing I did in 2013 is what I'm trying to do in 2014, which is continue to improve, continue to shock people. You know, I have several projects coming up between 2014 and 2015, and hopefully by 2015, I'll have another hour of stand-up material where I'll be able to go on the road and tour again.","When you have box-office results, Hollywood treats you different. Hollywood stands up. Once you get to the point where Hollywood sees that you create results, then the demand for you becomes higher.","I'm never gonna step away from stand-up. I can't. That's what got me where I am, and that's also my muse. That's how I stay level-headed. That's what keeps me going.","For me, it's about becoming a mogul, owning my own projects, and establishing myself as a funding producer. That's what's big to me. The movies and all that stuff are great, but the fact that I'm in a position to do what I want to do, however I want to do it and when I want to do it is bigger.","Every relationship should eventually become a long-term relationship. Any director that I meet now isn't just a director. He's potentially a friend, and someone I can call to do a project that I want or that I have.","Whatever is on the page is what I'm married to. I'm very prepared. I'm a thespian. I don't like to improv. I don't like to go off course 'cause I think that's where stuff happens. When you stick to the material 'cause it's written so well, that's where the magic happens.","I love being on stage, I love being able to tell a story, I love the fact that the audience listens and laughs at it. It makes me happy, and it's what I live for.","When you're coming up with new material, it's not always gonna be good. The only way to learn is for it not to get a laugh, so you can adjust it and come back the next day to see if it's working right. Next time, you might get a different laugh. You're constantly rebuilding.","I'm happy about working; I'm happy about gracing the stage and coming out and making people laugh. I never treat it like a job or feel that way. It's the best thing ever to me, and I feel like a kid in a candy store.","I learned from the guys before me - Bill Cosby, Eddie Murphy, Chris Rock, Richard Pryor, just to name a few. These are guys that let it all hang out. What they lived is what they took to the stage.","I'm not a big politics guy.","Comedy Central was a great network, but 'Chappelle's Show' took it to a completely different level. Other shows got bigger because so many viewers were watching the 'Chappelle' reruns. For BET, the 'Real Husbands of Hollywood' has that same potential.","I'm a businessman as well as an entertainer. The reason why is because I want to own whatever I'm doing. I don't want to work for other people forever.","Stand-up comedy is mine: it's my entity; it's my brand; I own it. I do it when I want to do it.","You definitely want your kids to understand their heritage, but I don't want my kids to just focus on being black. They are people. I don't want them to judge other people or to be judged. I want them to be good people, so good people will treat them accordingly. I preach that to my kids and everything else falls into place."],"Kevin Harvey":["I started looking all over for vineyard sites. I studied the conditions that make the best pinots. In the New World, you have to find the great pieces of land. Cool climate counts, but distinctive soil matters more than anything.","When we first invested in Red Hat, it was thought to be totally insane. When we funded MySQL, it was only partly insane.","Luxury brands are about elite access. In consumer goods, that's elite cost. In education, it's elite criteria for admission. Minerva is maintaining those high standards, but not artificially limiting the number of people who can meet it... This really may be redefining education."],"Kevin Hassett":["Too often, politics is like bad theater. The mass media simplifies stories and personalities into their most basic, digestible and familiar bits. Listeners prefer songs they have heard before, after all.","I think that one of the things that we have to recognize is that the longer somebody doesn't have a job, the harder it is to get a new job. You know, the reality is that if you're out of job, and you're looking for a job, then the new employer's going to say, 'Well, why, you know, don't you have a job now? What's wrong with you?'","Economists have the same occupational hazard as baseball managers and football coaches: Every person on the street knows their job better than they do.","Liberalized trade - in broadly multilateral, regional, or bilateral agreements - is a key ingredient in the recipe for prosperity... An absolute prerequisite for long-term economic growth is full participation in the global economy and trading system.","The term 'business cycle' is imprecise. Economic fluctuations affect everyone, not just businesses, and they are, unlike astral cycles, anything but regular.","If the U.S. doubled its total immigration and prioritized bringing in new workers, it could add more than half a percentage point a year to expected GDP growth.","The problem is that there is no reliable source of information left, no way to accumulate trusted accounts of the plusses and minuses of any given political choice.","If you look at the geographic variation in long-term unemployment, it's really striking. There are pockets where employers don't want to go, but for some reason, in part because of adequate safety nets, people don't want to leave.","There are folks who we have a moral responsibility to help, who are going to cost the taxpayers lots of money in the future, so there's a strong argument for us to help them with current cash.","Today we hear that the gains from economic growth accrue to the highest-income earners while the standard of living of the poor and middle America stagnates and the gap between the richest and the poorest grows ever wider. That portrait of the country is wrong.","Given the importance of Washington, outsiders probably have an unrealistic perspective on how large the city is. The fact is, Washington D.C. is a small town, and most everyone knows most everyone else. That person of the other party who you despise will someday be at your daughter's birthday party.","When a totally offensive tax hits a few million people, Washington is prepared to look the other way. But when everyone is harmed, self preservation kicks in, and Washington gets going.","Historically, figuring out what to do to the tax code has been almost as contentious a political issue as judicial appointments.","The most real characters in a great play are those who are so meticulously drawn that the audience could predict how many pairs of shoes they might have in their closet or how many close friends they had in grade school. Have any of our public figures been as fully developed in the media?","We've created the class of folks who are unemployed for longer than a year that it's very, very difficult to reconnect to society.","What we should do, if you want to give more money to the people who are currently unemployed, just give them the money. Give them a lump sum of cash. Don't make them stay unemployed for another three months in order to get the checks.","Lunchroom economic conversations are inevitably graced with at least one statement from an old-timer along the lines of, 'In my day, we walked 10 miles in the snow just to get to the recession.' In fact, the nature of recessions hasn't changed much over the years.","The fact is that any carbon legislation is designed to make us not use coal. So if you're a state that has a lot of coal, you're going to get hammered.","I am actually an open borders kind of guy.","For an American, as mad you may be about whatever the EPA or the IRS does, just imagine if you only had a one twenty-eighth vote over what it does. You were in this place with this big bureaucracy that sets rules, and you only have a small vote. You'd feel like you've given up your sovereignty, wouldn't you?","There is no tax policy that better describes how out of touch America's liberals are with the rest of the country than the estate tax. According to the Left, government seizure of a large share of the wealth of an American taxpayer is a moral imperative that serves social justice. Most Americans disagree, big time.","If someone builds a fortune, it belongs to him, not the government. An entitled government undermines liberty.","If you want to help the poor, help the poor, and with your own time and money. Liberals prefer to do it with someone else's, which is why they love the estate tax.","One of my favorite indicators of the near-term trend for the economy is auto sales, since folks tend to buy a car when they are feeling optimistic about their financial circumstances.","I prefer to listen to people who change their mind now and then.","Taxes can set the level of activity around which the economy fluctuates, but they have very little effect on the fluctuations themselves.","Socialized medicine allows a nation to exclude a U.S. product from its market if the U.S. firm does not make generous enough price concessions. Accordingly, what has developed is a system within which U.S. firms make large profits on new drugs in the U.S. market, but very low profits on sales everywhere else."],"Kevin Heffernan":["When you're in L.A., and you're making movies and that kind of stuff, you don't really get a sense sometimes, I think, what the fans are like. But you go into a room with 4,000 people or 2,000 people who know your movie, know the lines, and know the characters; it's really a lot of fun.","When I come out to do my stand-up set, I pretty much get bombarded with lines from movies. You try to play off it a little bit, but that's what people want to see. Some clubs, the drunker the audience gets, the more they heckle.","When you're acting and directing, you're standing there acting with another actor, and you're trying to do your performance, and at the same time you're watching their performance, and making sure the lights are in the right place, and if the person is wearing the right wardrobe. All these things are going on in your head.","It's like you work with people, and based on the size of the budget, you sometimes can't pay them what they deserve.","The beautiful thing about stand-up is you can create and immediately deliver, perform, and get paid for what you do.","It's just so hard to get movies made, especially comedies.","I went to law school after college.","I remember I was supposed to take the bar exam that summer just when we got the chance to make our first feature.

I don't write with an outline, and surprises happen on the way, and sometimes it changes.","When I was a boy, one of my uncles had a cabin on a lake in Wisconsin. My family went there for parts of three summers, and I loved it!","Whenever I'm writing a book, small details from my life always creep in.","When I work on a novel, I usually have one character and a setting in mind.","I think writers are observers and watchers. We always have our ears open and eyes open, so I might see something in everyday life that inspires me. And I think that's probably more than anything else. Everyday life is where I get my inspiration.","I usually do my writing in a very nice room, my studio, which is in the attic of our house in Wisconsin. But the nice thing about writing is that I can do it in many places. So sometimes I'll write in coffee shops.","When I'm drawing, I only do that at home, really, at my drawing table. But writing I could do in other places. So I've written in airports, in hotels, different places.","I like small, domestic stories.","I like examining the ordinary, and by doing so, one hopefully reveals the extraordinary nature within.","When I'm writing the text for a book like 'Little White Rabbit,' I read it aloud, alone, in my studio, again and again and again - because the rhythm has to be exactly right. After I get my manuscript to the point where I think it is perfect, I begin to think about what I want the art to look like.","When I'm writing, I'm creating the story and its character with words. I'm thinking about what the pictures will be like, but I never begin to sketch. The pictures are all in my head.","Everyone has something interesting to say.","When I was young, I assumed that authors must have traveled the world or done exotic things in order to tell great stories.","Books come from within.","You don't need to have kids to write a good book for kids.

We don't normally think up words, translate how to spell them and then move our fingers up and down over this randomly arranged set of keys to make the same letters appear on a screen.","I'm talking to you and it's basically a direct communication, whereas if I'm writing a letter to you and you read the letter, there are like 12 extra deconstruction and reconstruction steps in the communication.","If I could go back in time and tell my younger self that eventually that I'd become very successful writing Dune books after Frank Herbert's death, I would have laughed myself silly, I think, at how strange that prospect would be.","I did several interesting jobs, working in restaurants, I worked at a lab rat farm, feeding and watering all these rats. Then I got a full-time job as a technical writer for a large scientific research laboratory.","In a certain sense, this guy - who is one of the most evil people in the book - he's not really that bad at running the show, because he knows what he's doing, he's smart and he's got the big picture in mind. He's like the Godfather.","We sat around on a hotel balcony with a bottle of wine and tried to figure out how you would go about blowing up a planet. That's the kind of conversations science fiction writers have when they get together. We don't talk about football or anything like that.","I sold my very first novel when I was 24 or 25 years old.","My dad is a bank president and my mom was an accountant and they didn't think that seeking the life of a freelance writer was very practical, you see. Of course, I was just as determined to do it.","My total year's income from working as hard as I possibly could from writing went from like $30 one year to about $70 the next year. And it made me realize that maybe you couldn't really pay the rent that way.","The great secret behind classified projects is that most of them are so utterly boring and uninteresting that James Bond wouldn't even take a second look at them.","I had a minor in Russian history, and this was at the time when the big Cold War was going on.","I got to spend all of my time every day at work reading and editing papers about cutting-edge technical research and getting paid for it. Then I'd go home at night and turn what I learned into science fiction stories.","Sure, President Bush can say that the U.S. government won't fund stem cell research, but believe me, Japan is applauding. Because they will just do it first and get all the patents.","Every spare second I would write, somehow. On my lunch hour, too.","I always had this non-stop drive. I had to keep sending stories out and every once in awhile I'd get something accepted or get the little trickle of positive feedback.","I think now I'm up to something like 85 different titles that I've published.","It was like there was a pile of kindling that was in the back of my imagination just waiting there. Once I lit it, it just flared up and I kept getting ideas and ideas.","Of course you don't make any noise in space, because there's no air.","I wanted the feel in these books to be like an epic fantasy, with kings, queens, dukes and court politics, but of course like what I was explaining before, about making the science make sense, you have to make the politics make sense, too.","If you look at the British royal family and take away the scandals and the goofy stuff that's going on, people love to have this king to look up to - the royals are like celebrities.","One of the things that was kind of shocking for humans... was to come to terms with was the fact that, hey, we may not be the center of the universe.","There is grand romance in The Lord of the Rings. It's an important part of epic literature.","I don't think the author should make the reader do that much work to remember who somebody is.","I want to make it so that so many things happen... that you didn't expect would happen in this series, that you realize that you have to read every one of them.","Each book will have a lot of cliffhangers, because I like that.","I always turn in my books on time, so you can always count on a book coming out when it's supposed to.","I mean, I wasn't stupid. I knew we'd make money and sell a lot of Dune books.","We wanted to write the first prequels as a story that anyone could pick up.","Dune is the bestselling science fiction book of all time. It's something you really need to read in your lifetime. If you're going to read The Lord of the Rings, which everyone should, then you have to read Dune, too.","Wouldn't you like to have an augmented memory chip that you could plug into your head so you don't have to look everything up and remember everything?","Over the years, I've trained myself to speak using the same language I would use if I were typing: meaning using full sentences in the way that paragraphs and scenes are arranged.","I've had the same, full-time assistant and typist for eight or nine years now. She's read everything I've written, she types everything and does a good job, translates it and makes comments.","The people who make policy decisions should damned well know what they are talking about before they make the decisions.

If it works, great. If it doesn't, no problem.","I really wasn't a class clown.","As American as an apple is and as American as baseball is, they don't go together. You can't be chewing an apple at a baseball game. You've got to let go of the diet that day.","From there, I tried out for a community theatre play, joined an improv group... it all started opening up.","I took a public speaking class in college and managed to make the class laugh a little bit.","It's always cool to meet people who can do things that you have no capacity to do.","For some reason and I don't know why, but I don't think that I'm funny in California. So I always want to do my movies east somewhere.","I think I invented the phrase 'Don't overdo it.'","I would always love to be an athlete, but it's got to be a tough day when you have to hang up those cleats.","Teachers have a chance to mold someone, inspire them.

She gets so upset about it.","I want to do movies that I'm proud of where my kids, at some point, can see and I can feel comfortable sitting there watching it with them. And just that move people. That make people feel a little bit better about themselves when they leave the theatre.","I've always been the guy who doesn't necessarily get it with women. A woman would have to say, 'I like you, I want to go out with you, you can ask me.' And still I would question it.

One day a special record was heard and that was it. I was hooked, started trying to play various instruments and was off to bar land to become a rock star. What else?","I know I can catch the football. That's the least of my worries.","I have no desire to coach basketball.","I think that New York is the city of all cities. There is so much diversity there. I also like that when I go there, I can catch a play or musical and see some of the most talented people practicing their craft.","I just felt all along that if I could get a certain amount of years in the league, have great years and still have my health when I walked away, that would be great.","I still say one of the greatest moments in my whole NBA career was getting drafted.","Being selected Most Improved was a special individual award because when I speak to young people I always try to tell them the importance about it's not where you start but where you end up.","You realize you can't change the world but it shouldn't stop you from trying.","When I played in the NBA for 12 years, Seattle had some of the best fans in the NBA."],"Kevin Jorgeson":["Every athlete at his peak is going to perform with a different mental cocktail.

I never look back, so I don't have regrets.","They are not your players, they are loaned from the club. You just wheel them out for a game for England."],"Kevin Kelly":["We are infected by our own misunderstanding of how our own minds work.","An organization is a set of relationships that are persistent over time.","Changing things from the top down works when things are stable.","The way to build a complex system that works is to build it from very simple systems that work.","Managers tend to treat organizations as if they are infinitely plastic. They hire and fire, merge, downsize, terminate programs, add capacities. But there are limits to the shifts that organizations can absorb.","Technological advances could allow us to see more clearly into our own lives.","And they discovered something very interesting: when it comes to walking, most of the ant's thinking and decision-making is not in its brain at all. It's distributed. It's in its legs.","An organization's reason for being, like that of any organism, is to help the parts that are in relationship to each other, to be able to deal with change in the environment.","An organization's intelligence is distributed to the point of being ubiquitous.","The nature of an innovation is that it will arise at a fringe where it can afford to become prevalent enough to establish its usefulness without being overwhelmed by the inertia of the orthodox system.","The great advance of personal computers was not the computing power per se but the fact that it brought it right to your face, that you had control over it, that were confronted with it and could steer it.","Species go extinct because there are historical contraints built into a given body or a given design.","One of the functions of an organization, of any organism, is to anticipate the future, so that those relationships can persist over time.","Complexity that works is built up out of modules that work perfectly, layered one over the other.","Each system is trying to anticipate change in the environment.","The most interesting thing about change in the environment is that for the most part the environment isn't changing.","The most certain thing you can say about the environment tomorrow is that it probably is going to be just like today, for the most part.","The way that organizations and organisms anticipate the future is by taking signals from the past, most the time.","It has become evident that the primary lesson of the study of evolution is that all evolution is coevolution: every organism is evolving in tandem with the organisms around it.","Each organism's environment, for the most part, consists of other organisms.","In a broad systems sense, an organism's environment is indistinguishable from the organism itself.","When a system is in turbulence, the turbulence is not just out there in the environment, but is a part of the organization or organism that you are looking at.","The organization and the environment are in concert.","The current understanding was that it was impossible to predict how something would evolve because it was a very turbulent environment full of things interacting with each other.","But in fact, when you try to model that on a computer you find that because of the very structure of matter and of the chemical bonds that are the basis of every organism, evolution is not random at all. It will tend to follow certain paths.","Basins of attraction, of self organization, show up as well in our complex social environment, in human organizations. Here again, while we cannot predict the result of any given input, we can say that it will likely fall within one of several areas.","All imaginable futures are not equally possible.","This is actually a very important principle that science is learning about large systems like evolution and that futurists are learning about anticipating human society: just because a future scenario is plausible doesn't mean we can get there from here.","We tend to think of the mind of an organization residing in the CEO and the organization's top managers, perhaps with the help of outside consultants that they call in. But that is not really how an organization thinks.","A brain is a society of very small, simple modules that cannot be said to be thinking, that are not smart in themselves. But when you have a network of them together, out of that arises a kind of smartness.","It's generally much easier to kill an organization than to change it substantially.","Organisms by their design are not made to adapt too far.","But when you are embodied in a location, in a physical plant, in a set of people, and in a common history, that constrains your evolution and your ability to evolve in certain directions.","Organizations get invested into a particular product. And sometimes the best thing is to stop making that product, even though it's profitable, because it has optimized at a local peak.","But in a turbulent environment the change is so widespread that it just routes around any kind of central authority. So it is best to manage the bottom-up change rather than try to institute it from the top down.","Managing bottom-up change is its own art.","The system continually has to make this choice: it can either continue to exploit a known process and make it more productive, or it can explore a new process at the cost of being less efficient.","Much of outcomes research is a systematic attempt to exploit what is known and make it better.","Everything that we are making, we are making more and more complex.","It's more along the lines of raising a child: we train the system to a certain range of behaviors that we find most useful. But then we let it go, because we don't want to have to be babysitting it the whole time."],"Kevin Kline":["Nothing makes an actor feel freer and more inventive and more creative than being trusted.","Most of the comedies I've done have been rather farcical and extravagant.","It was all completely incomprehensible to me. I was fearful of the language. You had to look up every third word.","I totally related to Cole Porter's magnetic pull to any piano that was in the room, which he was famous for doing, as was Gershwin. You couldn't drag them away from a piano.","You know, actors are fans, too. And talent is very attractive to me.","It never ceases to surprise me, the people I get to work with. I'm in a French film with Sandrine Bonnaire? I adore Sandrine Bonnaire. I'm doing a picture for Robert Redford? The Sundance Kid? I have to pinch myself sometimes.","I had studied piano since I was 13, but I was surrounded by students who'd been playing since they were 5. I realized I was never going to be anything but mediocre.","Some of my favorite characters that I've played have been very pompous because I love making fun of pompous people.","I just don't think I'm a very good singer.","I can play characters who sing, but I don't like singing in a nightclub or something. It's not my metier.","Dogs do have feelings, I gather.","We're all animals, but we're a different sort of animal. Maybe they're better than us. They're more loyal. They're more pure. They're more simple. They're not neurotic. Well, there are some neurotic dogs.","But, I do think, on a very simplistic level, that we can project onto dogs because they are so innocent. They don't come with a lot of baggage.","I vowed I would never do a commercial, or a soap opera - both of which I did as soon as I left the Acting Company and was starving.","I've never felt completely satisfied with what I've done. I tend to see things too critically. I'm trying to get over that.","I think every American actor wants to be a movie star. But I never wanted to do stupid movies, I wanted to do films.","I've got the Jewish guilt and the Irish shame and it's a hell of a job distinguishing which is which.","I never went to class. That the university graduated me at all is an indictment of our educational system.","I don't like talking about myself. I don't like talking about my personal life.","Lots of people fantasize about what it would be like if they were president... Most think they'd be decent and wouldn't be corrupted at all, that they'd remain true to themselves.","When you have satire, it has to be real. No matter how outrageous the comedy becomes, you have to believe in the characters.","I'm a real pushover for animals."],"Kevin Kwan":["One of the dreams on my wish list is to spend more time in Thailand.","At least when it comes to food, there's no snobbery in Singapore.","Asian literature is evolving with the people. It's always a reflection on what's happening to the culture at large.","I sort of wanted to reveal this other side of Asia: Southeast Asia, where the Chinese have been wealthy for generations and have different ways of relating to money. I wanted to sort of reveal this world to readers.","I remembered that my grandfather had spent his teenage years in Shanghai and that he went back after he finished medical school to work there in a hospital. So I went back into my family archives and was able to find out his exact address; it was a street that was in the French Concession.","I think snobbery is one of the oldest customs in the world, and the rich will always find ways to rank each other and make themselves feel more special than others.","I was born in Singapore, and I lived there until I was 12. I had a very fortunate upbringing.","In Asia, it's customary to get together with your entire extended family on a regular basis, and it's all rife with politics.","I'm not revealing any deep, hidden secret that there are wealthy people in Asia.","My grandmother used to get her shoes made in Paris in the '30s, and they would be shipped to her in Singapore.","I do believe that peoples' natures can be changed, and they have to be changed if we want to live in this modern world and be a part of it.","To me, families are fascinating. I choose to explore it through comedy and through comic situations.","I've recently rediscovered Anthony Trollope. I used to read him back in college, and a friend turned me on to a whole new series of his work, 'The Palliser Series.' It's a series of seven or eight books.","There's always been this tradition of satirizing these rich groups of people.","'China rich' is the new 'crazy rich.' It's a new level of outrageousness. It comes from this world where overnight fortunes have been made, but the fortunes are so ginormous compared to anything we've ever seen in the history of the world.","If you're the water boiler king of China, you're selling a billion water boilers.","No matter our background, we all have crazy families.","Especially in the West, people want to understand Asia on a deeper level because it's become the engine of the world economy, like it or not.","The characters that populate my books are global nomads in their own right, keeping multiple homes around the world and constantly jet-setting to new places.","My books are comedies; I want to take my readers on a jet-setting romp, make them laugh, make them swoon at the beautiful settings, and maybe even make their mouths water at all the food.","If I were to generalize a bit, I would say that the ultra rich in Asia live on a scale that far surpasses the wealthy in the U.S. or Europe.","I've lived in New York City for over twenty years now, and every single day is like a new adventure. At this point, there are many places I'd love to visit, but I can't imagine living anywhere else on the planet.","Canada has become such a staging area for Chinese money.","Old money in Southeast Asia is much more discrete and low key. It's about not wearing brand names. It's about being invisible, almost. The billionaire can be taking the bus with you.","Even if they're not Asian or super rich... everyone has a nagging mother. Everyone has that obnoxious uncle, or that cousin who's a bit too snobby.","People have always been fascinated by the foibles of the wealthy and privileged.","All Americans knew was 'The Joy Luck Club' and children of dry cleaners trying to assimilate. The Asia that I was seeing was a world of people who are incredibly sophisticated, and I wanted to represent that side.","The idea of Asian ascendancy has entered public culture.","I met a Shanghai photographer who finds these old streets and matches the French names to what they are today. I was able to find my grandfather's block, and just walking the same streets and finding his house was deeply moving. I finally felt connected to China.","I live in New York, but I still get the village gossip. My apartment is a crash pad for so many Singaporean cousins and friends.","My father went to boarding school in Sydney when he was 14.","My father grew up in a life of extreme privilege.","A lot of the people who live the lives of 'Crazy Rich Asians' don't see the humour of their lives simply because this is just who they are. Even though I'm from that part of the world, I'm no longer part of that world.","I would not call my family 'traditional Chinese.' We were more what I would term the Colonial Chinese.","I'm not sure if being Chinese really helped, but I do think that if a non-Asian had written a book called 'Crazy Rich Asians,' they might not have been looked upon so kindly.","My grandparents were far more English in their manners than they were Chinese. For example, we spoke English at home, had afternoon tea every day, and my grandfather, who attended university in Scotland, would smoke his pipe after dinner.","The China Rich seem to be spending on a scale that's just beyond anything we've ever seen before. They are building and buying an insane amount of luxury residences around the world, commissioning huge flying palaces from Boeing, and paying ridiculous amounts for art.","I wanted to introduce a contemporary Asia to a North American audience.","There's so much emphasis on the economic might of China, of Southeast Asia, Asian 'Super Tigers' and things like that. But nobody was really looking from the perspective of a family story, of these individuals.","Writers often say that characters begin to write themselves, and I never used to believe that. I always thought that was complete hogwash.","It used to be, on TV, you'd see only two types of Asians. You'd see the science geek who's using his mobile phone or something like that, or you'd see a very token Asian family - yuppie mother and father and two little Asian kids. It's the last barrier for Hollywood.","Certainly, living in the U.S., as I have for over two decades, you see how Asians are portrayed in the media... I didn't see myself represented, you know, when I used to look at ads on TV.","I grew up at a time in Singapore - the '70s and '80s - where it was still possible to go riding around the island barefoot. And I was one of these kids that was just climbing trees and running around the neighbourhood.","It's not normal to go into a house and see a pond in the middle of the living room full of baby sharks. It's not normal to go to someone's garage and see a private plane.","My mother likes to say that I was conceived to shop - not just born to shop. My whole life as a child was following her and her sister and friends around on her shopping trips.","There are old-money Asians that would never be caught dead with a Chanel handbag or sporting anything that has a label it.","In order for me to write a scene, it's very important for me to see and experience everything with my own eyes, so yes, I was able to visit some remarkable houses and destinations while I was in China.","Living in the West, you see how there's only two versions of how Asian men are supposed to be. Either they're very nice, yuppie husbands with children in ads, or they're IT geeks.","I think, at least for me, I'm so impressed by Shanghai and how all of China continues to evolve. On a style level, you're seeing this increased sophistication and brand awareness.","Growing up in Singapore, I wasn't allowed to visit China. So when I was finally able to go there after the country began opening up to tourism in the 1990s, I found it to be utterly astounding.","I've always been drawn to the Edwardian period in England. To me, it seems like such a fascinating time, when the British Empire was at the height of its powers and the strict mores of the Victorian age were dissipating into the decadence of King Edward's reign.","It would have been amazing to have been a student at Oxford during that golden moment in the 1910s, rubbing elbows with the likes of Aldous Huxley and T.E. Lawrence, before World War I shattered everything forever.","I wanted to explore what all this new-found wealth means for the different generations of Chinese who have to live together in this place that is transforming at warp speed into the richest country on the planet.","It's human nature when you first make your big fortune to want to show off a bit. I don't begrudge that whatsoever.","My father came from old money. There was less of an expectation for the children to earn a living.","I spent the first 12 years of my life growing up in Singapore. Back then, in the early '80s, it was still a tropical island at the tip of the Malay Peninsula striving to shine on the world stage.","As a child, I could bike down the hill from my house and grab an ice-cold bottle of soda from the neighborhood grocer, which was nothing more than a corrugated metal shack run by two Indian men clad in sarongs.","I know an elderly society matron in Singapore who would rather walk in the scorching sun for blocks on end rather than have her chauffeur drive into the Central Business District at peak hour and pay the $1.50 surcharge.","I go to Shenzhen, China, and am taken to a vast luxury spa with a hundred leather recliners and a hundred accompanying plasma screen televisions bolted to the ceiling.","The most important thing to keep in mind is the incredible diversity of talent that's out there - there are so many great actors from all over Asia, from Singapore and Hong Kong to the Philippines and Mainland China, not to mention many great Asian-American actors who are eager for fun and challenging roles.","In Singapore, there may be 50 old-money families, but you wouldn't know them to look at them.","Such huge money has been made in China - it can be hundreds of millions in a year - and there's a need to validate it by showing what they can buy and how much of it."],"Kevin Lima":["We feel really lucky at Disney to work with a great stable of artists.","What we do sometimes when we're in the sessions recording the dialogue is we'll set up a video camera and we'll video the whole session. So then the animator, if he wants, can draw upon those tapes to pull expressions, mouth shapes, maybe some gesturing that happens.","We didn't ever want 'Tarzan' to feel like he was just a man. We didn't want him to stand up straight or wave good-bye. We wanted to make sure he always had that piece of gorilla in him, that he always had an animal attitude about him.","From the very, very beginning, we made the decision that 'Tarzan' wasn't going to sing. My co-director, Chris Buck, and I said to each other that we couldn't imagine a half-naked man in the jungle simply bursting into song.","The way we got Phil Collins for 'Tarzan' was that we heard around the studio that he was looking for a Disney project, and we got him. It seemed like a perfect match. Phil is a great musician.","I sat with the grandson of Edgar Rice Burroughs at the world premiere of 'Tarzan,' and at the end of the film, he was very happy. He told me that we were bringing 'Tarzan' to a whole new generation, and he was very grateful.","I'm sure they will have more sequels for 'Tarzan' where he goes to England, school, and whatever else they can think of. It's a natural that they will continue the series."],"Kevin Love":["To me, throwback means I'm a smart player. I know how to play the game. I'm very skilled. I do a lot of things that other people don't do.","I have a very, very good memory, and I always remember the people who have done right by me and the people who have done wrong by me.","It's no secret I was willing to commit to Minnesota for five years. I'm very happy with my contract. I'd love to be in Minnesota. But like anybody else, I want to win.","My dad put up a great hoop in our front yard in our driveway. I was in Oregon, so I had to be out there in the rain. We didn't always have a gym to go to.","I just try to keep the same people I've had around me from Day One. Keep it a real small circle because if you do that, not too much is going to go bad for you.","I was lucky. A lot of people have that. People that don't tell you what you want to hear, but what's best for you. I was blessed with great friends. I was always blessed that way. My dad always kept good people around me. I just got lucky. Because of the spotlight you're in, people are scared to tell you otherwise.","At the end of the day, I've played six years, haven't made the playoffs yet, that burns me and hurts my heart, so I really want to be playing.","Randy Wittman told me not to shoot 3-pointers. That got me very uncomfortable. There were certain labels tagged on me very early in my career, spots on the floor where I felt uncomfortable.","The more downtime we have, the more time you have to play games like 'Ghost Recon Future Soldiers,' so for me it's a fun way to get integrated into video games and for me to have fun with my buddies and team up and go into battle with 'em, kind of like out there on court.","I'm not the one to always follow professional protocol - but I do know what it is, even at 24 years old.","I just go out there and play. I don't know if it's being young and not getting calls, or some other circumstances. I'm just trying to make a play.","Coach Wooden, when he speaks, you listen. I've taken a lot of things from him and his little blue book because to him, it's not just about basketball, it's about life as well.","I think any time you have Phil Jackson involved in any organization, you're going to definitely look at it, and it's definitely intriguing. The Knicks are definitely a place where anybody would like to go.","For me, it's always easy and great to be connected to St. Jude.","I'll always have a score-first mentality, because that is my bread and butter on the floor.","I was tagged early as the prototypical white player, the guy with the intangibles - the smart player, the guy who did all the right things.","When you're on the court, there is certain things that you would do that you wouldn't do off the court. When you get off, you obviously have to be gracious and a humble person. When you are on the floor, be a team player. Championships are what you are defined by - legacy. Go about things the right way.","I'm kind of a dirty guy, a little Bill Laimbeer-ish. Those are the guys I used to watch growing up. I used to watch Karl Malone; now I watch Boozer and Elton Brand and try to emulate those guys as much as possible because those guys are about the same size as me.","I was talking to Coach Wooden after I had signed at UCLA and over the summer, and we used to talk all the time. The thing is, talking to Bill Walton, once you throw in your two cents, he throws in the other 98 cents. He will not stop talking, I'll tell you what.","I feel like in order for our team to have the upper hand, I have to play extremely well, and I have to bring the rest of the team with me. That's how I feel approaching every game.","When he's healthy, Zach Randolph for the Memphis Grizzlies has always been somebody that has always been very tough to play against.","Luckily, I'm young and I have a great training staff that helps me take care of my body day in and day out. You make sure you're eating right. Make sure you're hitting the iron, lifting as much as you possibly can. That's easier said than done because we don't have many practice days."],"Kevin Lynch":["The productivity and expressiveness of Flash remain advantages for the Web community even as HTML advances.","We feel confident that, were Apple and Adobe to work together as we are with a number of other partners, we could provide a terrific experience with Flash on the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch.","A wide variety of devices beyond personal computers are arriving, many of which will be used to browse the Web... The Flash engineering team has taken this on with a major overhaul of the mainstream Flash Player for a variety of devices.","We're so connected, kind of ever-presently, with technology now. People are carrying their phones with them and looking at the screen so much.","Creative Cloud is Adobe re-imagining itself amid a world of these three transformations - cloud, multiscreen and social computing - which are all happening at the same time.","With Typekit, you sign on, you pay a single subscription fee. We're including that as part of Creative Cloud.","Adobe and Apple have collaborated a lot over the decades. There's a lot more for us to do as well.","We're actually helping advance HTML5 in some very concrete ways, such as Edge, which is in beta.","I'll be involved more with Adobe overall in terms of our technology direction and the problems we are trying to solve, working across the different business units at Adobe.","AIR grew out of our early thinking about rich Internet applications around 2001. We started to see web developers pushing the boundaries of what could be done inside the browser and taking advantage of Flash in ways that we hadn't expected.","AIR was born from thinking about how rich Internet applications would play out over time and what new pieces of technology would be in demand for these to go to their next generation.","Just like the Internet has transformed the media industry or the e-commerce industry, the software industry is also being affected dramatically by the Internet.","You can't go to the store and buy 'the Engagement Platform.'","When television came out, there was concern it would kill radio.","It's not about HTML 5 vs Flash. They're mutually beneficial. The more important question is the freedom of choice on the web.","When you're displaying content, any technology will use more power to display, versus not displaying content.","Flash and HTML have co-existed, and they're going to continue to co-exist."],"Kevin McCarthy":["How we fund transportation in this country is broken. You all pay a gasoline tax, right? Well, cars go farther, we get electric cars, and so on. And then we do more with the money than just build roads. We do bike lanes and mass transit.","My belief is you have one chance to make a first impression.","As any small business owner knows, starting a business is not glamorous work.","I like to be around people, so I ended up being roommates, right? I had a house. I lived with four guys.","America needs education reform on all levels to expand quality schools, build on past successes, and lower college debt.","What you really want to do is sit down and find a place that you can control government spending and raise more revenue.","Budgets are blueprints and priorities.","The simple truth is that the implementation of Obamacare has hurt Americans and their health care more than it has helped.","Outside of the family, education is the greatest determinant of social mobility.","Most accountants will tell you the majority of small businesses run as an S Corporation.","There's a staircase on the first floor of the Capitol that I walk every day. It's made of marble, and as you walk those steps, you think of those who've walked before you. You think of the challenges that the country's faced.","After hearing from my colleagues, I have decided to run for Speaker of the House. Let's work together to make a difference for our country.","In addition to billions in new 'stimulus' spending that our country can't afford, the Geithner plan also contains billions in tax increases on small and family-owned businesses while protecting the tax preferences of wealthy, multinational corporations.","It's not easy for the average family to ensure that their child receives a quality education. And the federal government is not making it any easier.","Life in the restaurant business can provide a start in the working world for young people or a stable living for many Americans and their families.","Every American, whether Democrat or Republican, agrees that job creation and affordable energy will be crucial to our economic turnaround.","Once our country is fully engulfed in a debt crisis, our economy will be torn apart, and every American will be a victim of the federal government's failure to prevent this disaster.","Everybody has a say, everybody has a voice, because everyone that comes to the House had about 750,000 people they're representing . And you want those voices heard.","Too many people in Washington care about power institutions, not caring about changing the lives of everyday Americans.","We are committed to doing trade, tax reform, infrastructure. All we need is someone that wants to work with us.","The whip's office is almost more educational - educating members on the bill itself, listening to members ahead of time.","We know the Constitution gives the purse strings to the House.","The first priority of the Republican majority is the security of Americans.","The edge of a black hole, the event horizon, is a boundary that marks the point of no return. Once an object crosses the event horizon, it cannot escape and will be ripped to pieces, atom by atom.","You cannot be the leader of the free world and sit on the sidelines and tweet and think you're going to get the job done.","When I think of the future, I think of my 15 year old son Connor and my 12 year old daughter Meghan. I worry about their future because your kids are as important to you as mine are to me. And I am unwilling to leave our children with so much debt.","Our government has failed us. From the billion-dollar bailouts to the 'stimulus' package that failed to stimulate to the government takeover of health care, you cried 'Stop!'... but the Democratic Majority in Washington has refused to listen.","I want a leader that sets out a path. I want one that doesn't just talk about cuts, but talks about the shining city on the hill. We're only going to get out of this problem if we grow this economy.","There are two different types of leader. A person can either be like a thermometer or a thermostat. A thermometer will tell you what the temperature is. A thermostat will not only tell you what the temperature is, but it'll move you to the temperature you need to get to.","I don't live in D.C. I keep an air mattress in my office.","I'm a conservative. I believe in the idea of freedom and liberty, but more importantly, look at my voting background. I voted against bailing out Wall Street. I voted against, never voted for, a tax increase.","My family was not Republicans. I'm the youngest. I came to this party based upon choice.","I believe the Constitution matters: that it's not just a few pieces of paper.","I believe you can work with anybody.","Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping.","Small business creates more jobs than large corporations.","We're going to have to control the spending of government.","I started a deli when I was 19 years old. Kevin O's. The sandwiches at Kevin O's were a little like Subway before Subway - fresh baked bread. My best seller was turkey with cream cheese and artichoke hearts. I just made it up.","My wife Judy and I have two kids: Connor, 17, and Meghan, who is 14. My wife and I no longer worry about what we become - we are worried about what our children become.","Energy is the issue I care most about.","I think there are changes in the environment. There are a lot of items to contribute to it.","I do believe in the free market.","We pledge to you that we will create jobs. End economic uncertainty and make America more competitive. We will cut Washington wasteful spending and reduce the size of government. And we will reform Congress and restore your trust in government.","Many times, the Senate talks of things and never gets anything through.","I believe any time that both parties are talking, it's a good thing.","I think it's undignified if you don't do your job.","Many times, we spend so much time on policy, but we don't explain how the policy affects and makes the heart even grow bigger. And I think that's a place that we have to look inside.","I'm on record saying nothing about immigration until we secure the borders. The borders are not secure.","If elected Speaker, I promise you that we will have the courage to lead the fight for our conservative principles and make our case to the American people. But we will also have the wisdom to listen to our constituents and each other so that we always move forward together.","For years now, long before I became House majority leader, I have been passionate about foreign affairs because I believe that anyone who leads in Washington must appreciate the significance of America's role in providing for global security and prosperity.","I met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel, visited our allies in the Arab Gulf, traveled to Tunisia and Iraq, met with President Petro Poroshenko in Ukraine, and visited our allies in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom.","The principles that should guide American foreign policy are simple: the world is safer when America leads, only strength ensures peace and freedom, and America must stand with its allies and challenge its adversaries.","If Russia wants to use energy as a weapon against our friends and allies, let's use our resources to set them free.","The facts are clear. Obamacare is failing the American people.","Small businesses already struggle to compete with big businesses that enjoy the luxury of a tax code filled with corporate loopholes.","America is nation of people striving to make life better for themselves and for their families.","Together, we can create something new, something bold, and something to act as a check and balance to Washington's out-of-touch agenda.","As conservatives, we know our principles, and we also know the best ideas do not always come from Washington.","I believe in a free market of ideas and not shying away from debate.","In Washington, we've seen enough tax hikes, government takeovers, bailouts, and other big government solutions under Speaker Pelosi's control.","When kids start school, families often have little choice over where they can go. Sometimes, children are forced into a failing school simply because their parents live in a certain district, and that school is the only option.","Working at a restaurant is a tough gig.","Servers make very little in regular wages and largely rely on tips to pay the bills and budget for weeks ahead.","For restaurants that have a minimum gratuity charge on large groups, the IRS will now count those tips as regular wages rather than traditional tips that we are all familiar with when we dine out. Ask any server, and they will tell you that this will directly affect their day-to-day lifestyle.","Keystone will deliver 830,000 barrels of oil per day from Canada, North Dakota, and Montana to Gulf Coast refineries.","Despite support from a majority of Americans, a majority of the House of Representatives, and a majority of the Senate, Keystone XL is stuck - stalled by special-interest politics.","Fortunately, there is a project that will create jobs, provide direct investment in our economy, and move us closer to our longstanding goal of becoming energy independent: the Keystone XL pipeline.","Black holes destroy any objects that happen to fall victim to their gravitational pull.","When gross public debt exceeds 90 percent of GDP, economic growth tends to decline considerably.","I don't want to become Washington.","When government grows, it breaks the family.","When it comes to tyrants, dictators and terrorists, strength and the threat of force is the only language they understand.","Peace comes through strength, not through retreat.","Politically correct speech will not defeat the enemy.","We can't be afraid to call the enemy what it is: Radical Islamic terrorism.","The gasoline tax is a user fee, but it does not fill enough of the need, and you want cars to be more efficient.","The challenge has been, we make policy in the world of politics.","Reagan was president and had Democrats control the House and Senate, and they reformed the tax code. Clinton was president, and he had Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole; they reformed welfare and balanced the budget."],"Kevin McCloud":["I cannot look at modern buildings without thinking of historical ones.","Building your own home is about desire, fantasy. But it's achievable; anyone can do it.","A friend of mine once wrote a silly article about all these metrosexuals like David Beckham wearing sarongs, and she described me as a 'heteropolitan.' I don't know what that means. I think it was a joke.","The thing that I champion is sustainability. My terror is that suddenly we see it as a luxury, not an essential. That's a danger.","Generally speaking, I think that if you do anything with commitment and passion, it will come good.","One mustn't mistake bling for excellence, just as one mustn't mistake quiet for mediocre.","Every decently-made object, from a house to a lamp post to a bridge, spoon or egg cup, is not just a piece of 'stuff' but a physical embodiment of human energy, testimony to the magical ability of our species to take raw materials and turn them into things of use, value and beauty.","A great deal of energy is wasted in hating people, and I can honestly say I've no wish to expend such a precious resource on being outraged about anyone.","I don't enjoy living in a white box flooded with light. I like shadows, small spaces, old furniture.","Architecture was pretty much the sexiest thing to be doing from 1700-1800.","I'm terribly fastidious. I like symmetry and neatness, but my house is as chaotic as any other family's.","I don't know whether other asthma sufferers find this, but I've noticed that even when I've got my asthma under control, I often develop another problem such as an ear, chest or sinus infection and sometimes even joint pains.","The more of your private life you put into the public domain, the smaller your private life becomes.","Building your own house is a primal urge, one of those universal genetic drives like the need to provide for your family.","Your home should be about enriching the daily experience.","We are borrowing money from future generations. We are borrowing the carbon impact, the resource impact from future generations to get stuff cheap now. We have swept the dirt and dust from our society under the carpet - but this carpet is on other side of the planet.","I'm not too fond of really cool design. I've got quite kitsch taste really, in things like tableware. I'm quite a sucker for 1930s pressed glass.","You cannot use the democratic process for the procurement of excellence.","As a property developer, I learned a long time ago to choose your battles wisely and that, unfortunately, compromise is a given.","Self-builders are the adrenalin junkies of the DIY world; it's the equivalent of base-jumping off the top of the Gherkin to land in a paddling pool.","Living an environmentally responsible lifestyle can seem like a Scrooge-like list of don'ts. Don't take that flight, don't buy that car, don't eat those blueberries flown in from somewhere far-flung.","If I welcomed people into my lovely home every week in the pages of a magazine, they'd soon see how incredibly dull it is. It's important to maintain a bit of mystique.","I was never a hugely successful theatre designer. I painted a lot of scenery and did the lighting, and my lighting business grew out of that.","I like the absurd and the surreal: the Coen brothers, Bunuel, Kubrick.","I'm really quite conscious of clothes and the way they fit and don't regret wearing anything. Not even the five-inch stack heels I wore with three-button high-waisters at comprehensive school. Regret is for wimps.","Building design isn't trendy.","Because I live in the countryside, I want a building which encourages me to have a fully formed relationship with the environment. It gives me an opportunity to not just be inside or outside, but in a range of contexts.","What happened in 2008 stopped people in their tracks. People stopped looking at their homes simply as commodities to exploit and starting thinking about how they might personalise that space and make them less bland and more autobiographical, and that's healthy, I think.","Life involves other people and it is a compromise.","I am a big fan of long drop, composting toilets - I like the cycle of using waste. When you have experienced one and seen what comes out of the bottom, it is amazing stuff. It's the most beautiful, driest, sweet-smelling compost.","I don't look at what people do with their homes in terms of money, but the social and personal value of what they're trying to do and achieve.","People have got to get over the fear of not being able to trust others. I come across people who are very successful in their own sphere, and really believe they can do it all themselves, but they can't.","There's no reason for your imagination to be fettered by money.","I've got lots of friends who are musicians, and there is a fair proportion of broken marriages and relationships as a result. You are on the move all the time. It's difficult if you have kids, and it's hard to make money unless you are in the premier league.","Building a house from scratch in the middle of a field is a bit like building a prototype car. As with all prototypes, if you're building a car you usually have the luxury of producing several prototypes before you arrive at the production line version - so the opportunity for changing things is quite rich.","My favourite authors include Trollope and Dickens.","I don't want anything that I buy to have done any harm to anyone or anything.","I'm terrified of being poor, I always have been. It's growing up as a Methodist. I'll spend that bit of extra money to get a better seat on a train sometimes, because it's quieter and calmer, but I refuse to spend money on clothes.","I spend a frightening amount of money on books.","If you said to me, 'Lie down on that concrete floor and fall asleep,' I could do it. I can sleep anywhere at any time of day on any surface.","I hate negativity. I hate people who say the phrase 'I hate'. I really don't like the word 'hate.' Dislike, frightened of, terrified of, or yukky - but not 'hate.'","Every breath we take as human beings damages the planet.","I've got a farm in Somerset, and I think it's God's own country. I love it.","I'm quite shy. Television presents an amplified version of yourself. When I'm on camera I'm pumping more adrenaline, I'm being a bit more engaging than I am in everyday conversation, but that's normal, isn't it? Otherwise nobody would want to watch.","I'm driven by issues, not driven to be political.","I have a recurring nightmare that I wake up in a gutter with nothing. I've had it all my life. That's why I work, I think.","It's possible to be satisfied with a day's work or a cake, but a life... what is a life but a history of events badly remembered?","I admire anyone that follows the road less travelled.","My father, an engineer, was the gentlest man I knew.","Luckily I have never missed a day's filming or work due to asthma.","I've had my fair share of colds, which last longer than they should and can cause wheezing, so I avoid people who are sneezing like the plague and am scrupulous about hygiene and hand-washing.","There's nothing you can do about busted ribs. You just have to wait for them to pop back into place again.","When I left university, I idled around without focus for much too long.","I've forgiven all my enemies - even those who have stolen money from me."],"Kevin McCollum":["I love creating opportunities for people. I think it's my orphan mentality.","We all tell our own stories the way we live our lives. My story is: Life is too short to not believe in fresh voices. I don't have Hollywood stars. I have great American artists.","Theater is about surprises and things that you haven't seen before on stage.","Film is much more of a brand business, whereas on Broadway, you can do complete unknowns and have hits.","Whether it's New York or somewhere else, the metaphor of 'Avenue Q,' which is the place you live when you can't afford to live anywhere else - and we've all been through that in our journey. As I always say, at any moment I could be back on Avenue Q if I pick the wrong show.","Make something new, and define territory that's never been. I fall in love with shows because I've never see that before. I fall in love with new vocabularies."],"Kevin McDonald":["So the laughs had to come from the character, not because we had balloons in our shirts or were speaking in high voices. That was very important to us.","We always thought that we'd go on from the show to have a career in movies.","We never thought the first movie would bomb.","We end the show with something that's never been on TV because it was too big for a sketch but we couldn't stretch it out to make a whole episode because it would have been too long, but we always thought it was really good.","Anything that was perverse and silly would be Kids in the Hall.","What I always say is that we're the illegitimate children of Andy Kaufman and Jerry Lewis.","Of course Toronto might as well be Buffalo, because we get each other's TV.","We're doing 3,000 seaters before that we never played anything more than 1,000.","Oh, completely liberating because even if you don't do a woman right, you just have to put on high heels a wig, a bra and a dress, and I feel liberated.","I feel that I'm sort of playing me but more feminine, and to me more feminine means smarter.","Well... Actually I got picked because I was the only one who fit the wedding gown - they had my size.","I can't explain it, but spiritually it makes sense - though I don't understand how it does make sense.","I had to learn how to drive because I didn't drive in Toronto.","You know, I've never seen South Park, just by coincidence.","I would also would have liked the part of the Bus Driver.","He sort of gets comic moments. Not a lot of directors do.","Yes, they allowed us to play around a lot because, like we said, the director's such a good comedy director.","And we know Bruce Campbell from way back, so that was a lot of fun."],"Kevin McHale":["I have a sweet tooth problem. On tour, in catering, the dessert was always so good. When we started the tour I was in the best shape of my life, but by the end of it I was horrible.","Adaptability is crucial to working on Glee because every day is adapting to something. Because we're doing a different genre of music, doing a different type of scene with a different scene partner, recording and dance rehearsals... no day is like another.","James Morrison just had a new album come out and I think he's incredible. I'd love to work with him, his voice is insane.","In San Paulo I went to the movies and by the time I left the theater there was a mob at the exit. I had never been in that kind of situation when we weren't on tour and there was a whole bunch of security. I'm a little dude, and out of nowhere to have 50 or 60 people come running towards me when I'm jut with my friend, it was kind of scary.","I love chocolate mousse, that's probably my favorite. I'm a big strawberry shortcake fan as well. I'm not mad at classic vanilla either. I'm not, I'm not sure what the word is. Cake discriminatory? Cakeist?","I sang before I acted, but I always wanted to do them simultaneously.","People aren't paying to see the Kevin McHale show, they're paying to see the cast of 'Glee.'","I would love to do film someday, but I think we are all so happily in tune with 'Glee' that we are sticking with that right now.","I am up for anything, but my favorite show in the whole world is this English series, 'Skins.' It would be awesome to be able to go on that somehow.","I'm scared to see myself in 3D.","'Talk to me,' it's what you say to someone to let them know you're there. Just three simple words. But saying them out loud could help save a life."],"Kevin McKidd":["I love whiskey and haggis. I can't get enough of either.","If a man comes up to me, I'm almost sure he's going to mention Rome, if it's a woman, it'll be 'Grey's Anatomy.'","It's a roll of the dice in the movie business. I mean, every single movie is a roll of the dice. Any movie on paper could look like it's going to be fantastic. You know what I mean?","I'm always very excited by something that's a curveball or from left field.","I've done movies that I've been advised not to do. 'Dog Soldiers,' the movie I did 11 years ago now, I remember my agent at the time was like, 'You shouldn't do that. It's a weird film about werewolves,' and it became a cult hit.","I generally play villains once every three or four years by choice because I get offered villainous roles a lot, because of the way I look and whatever. And I tend to avoid them because I think you can end up in a cul-de-sac of your own making if you're cast in that.","I really just like acting. I'm not always aware of what is hip and what is popular and what is zeitgeist.","'Grey's' is just a machine. I wasn't really prepared for the epic nature of how popular the show is.","I am the god of being messy - I'm trying to get better. I was terrible in my 20s. My kids are much tidier than I am, I don't know where they get it from, maybe their mother.","I live in L.A. so I worry my kids aren't that connected to Britain, I suppose I don't want them to become American kids. We try to get back three or four times a year. When they go to school they speak with a British-American accent but when they come home to us they go back to their British accent.","I suppose I am a frustrated musician so I annoy my family by playing guitar in the house. I used to be into acoustic stuff but my son Joseph is learning drums, so now I have an electric guitar and we play Metallica. We have an amp and a PA in the garage with his drum kit.","In the late-'80s, there was a big push to make American football big in Scotland. The Super Bowl was on TV, but it didn't really catch on. When I was a kid, though, I became a big Miami Dolphins fan. I don't really know why - I just liked the logo, I guess. I didn't really know what was going on.","I actually love working with accents. I don't know, something about it unlocks something in me. It makes me concentrate on getting into character a little more, helps me find a focus.","One of my complaints with American TV characters is that they all have a particular schtick, a hook.","I was asked to be in the last two 'Harry Potter' films and I couldn't do it because I was busy filming 'Grey's Anatomy.'"],"Kevin Michael Richardson":["A lot of times when people cast me, they want this big, deep black voice... And I tend to recycle them with different roles from time to time.","I love Panthro, so to play him, yeah I'm very very happy."],"Kevin Mitnick":["At the end of the day, my goal was to be the best hacker.","Companies spend millions of dollars on firewalls, encryption, and secure access devices and it's money wasted because none of these measures address the weakest link in the security chain: the people who use, administer, operate and account for computer systems that contain protected information.","To some people I'll always be the bad guy.","Somebody could send you an office document or a PDF file, and as soon as you open it, it's a booby trap and the hacker has complete control of your computer. Another major problem is password management. People use the same password on multiple sites, so when the hacker compromises one site, they have your password for everywhere else.","The hacker mindset doesn't actually see what happens on the other side, to the victim.","I wasn't a hacker for the money, and it wasn't to cause damage.","If you go to a coffee shop or at the airport, and you're using open wireless, I would use a VPN service that you could subscribe for 10 bucks a month. Everything is encrypted in an encryption tunnel, so a hacker cannot tamper with your connection.","New security loopholes are constantly popping up because of wireless networking. The cat-and-mouse game between hackers and system administrators is still in full swing.","I think it goes back to my high school days. In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A.","The hacking trend has definitely turned criminal because of e-commerce.","I got so passionate about technology. Hacking to me was like a video game. It was about getting trophies. I just kept going on and on, despite all the trouble I was getting into, because I was hooked.","I'm still a hacker. I get paid for it now. I never received any monetary gain from the hacking I did before. The main difference in what I do now compared to what I did then is that I now do it with authorization.","I was addicted to hacking, more for the intellectual challenge, the curiosity, the seduction of adventure; not for stealing, or causing damage or writing computer viruses.","The key to social engineering is influencing a person to do something that allows the hacker to gain access to information or your network.","I saw myself as an electronic joy rider.","Anything out there is vulnerable to attack given enough time and resources.","Social engineering is using deception, manipulation and influence to convince a human who has access to a computer system to do something, like click on an attachment in an e-mail.","A hacker doesn't deliberately destroy data or profit from his activities.","The explosion of companies deploying wireless networks insecurely is creating vulnerabilities, as they think it's limited to the office - then they have Johnny Hacker in the parking lot with an 802.11 antenna using the network to send threatening emails to the president!","I was fascinated with the phone system and how it worked; I became a hacker to get better control over the phone company.","A lot of companies are clueless, because they spend most or all of their security budget on high-tech security like fire walls and biometric authentication - which are important and needed - but then they don't train their people.","I happen to be notorious. That, I have no control over.","Should we fear hackers? Intention is at the heart of this discussion.","Hacking is exploiting security controls either in a technical, physical or a human-based element.","My primary goal of hacking was the intellectual curiosity, the seduction of adventure.","Hackers are breaking the systems for profit. Before, it was about intellectual curiosity and pursuit of knowledge and thrill, and now hacking is big business.","You can never protect yourself 100%. What you do is protect yourself as much as possible and mitigate risk to an acceptable degree. You can never remove all risk.","I trust online banking. You know why? Because if somebody hacks into my account and defrauds my credit card company, or my online bank account, guess who takes the loss? The bank, not me.","As a young boy, I was taught in high school that hacking was cool.","I went from being a kid who loved to perform magic tricks to becoming the world's most notorious hacker, feared by corporations and the government.","I made stupid decisions as a kid, or as a young adult, but I'm trying to be now, I'm trying to take this lemon and make lemonade.","Think about it: if you were running a multi-million dollar company, and your database of customer information was stolen, would you want to tell your clients? No. Most companies did not until the laws required them to. It's in the best interest of organisations - when they're attacked and information is stolen - to tell nobody.","It's true, I had hacked into a lot of companies, and took copies of the source code to analyze it for security bugs. If I could locate security bugs, I could become better at hacking into their systems. It was all towards becoming a better hacker.","Protecting yourself is very challenging in the hostile environment of the Internet. Imagine a global environment where an unscrupulous person from the other side of the planet can probe your computer for weaknesses and exploit them to gain access to your most sensitive secrets.","People are prone to taking mental shortcuts. They may know that they shouldn't give out certain information, but the fear of not being nice, the fear of appearing ignorant, the fear of a perceived authority figure - all these are triggers, which can be used by a social engineer to convince a person to override established security procedures.","Social engineering is using manipulation, influence and deception to get a person, a trusted insider within an organization, to comply with a request, and the request is usually to release information or to perform some sort of action item that benefits that attacker.","Garbage can provide important details for hackers: names, telephone numbers, a company's internal jargon.","Penetrating a company's security often starts with the bad guy obtaining some piece of information that seems so innocent, so everyday and unimportant, that most people in the organization don't see any reason why the item should be protected and restricted.","Then again, my case was all about the misappropriation of source code because I wanted to become the best hacker in the world and I enjoyed beating the security mechanisms.","I believe in having each device secured and monitoring each device, rather than just monitoring holistically on the network, and then responding in short enough time for damage control.","Hackers are becoming more sophisticated in conjuring up new ways to hijack your system by exploiting technical vulnerabilities or human nature. Don't become the next victim of unscrupulous cyberspace intruders.","A company can spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on firewalls, intrusion detection systems and encryption and other security technologies, but if an attacker can call one trusted person within the company, and that person complies, and if the attacker gets in, then all that money spent on technology is essentially wasted.","I can go into LinkedIn and search for network engineers and come up with a list of great spear-phishing targets because they usually have administrator rights over the network. Then I go onto Twitter or Facebook and trick them into doing something, and I have privileged access.","I characterize myself as a retired hacker. I'm applying what I know to improve security at companies.","It doesn't work the same way everywhere. The Americans are the most gullible, because they don't like to deny co-workers' requests. People in the former Soviet bloc countries are less trusting, perhaps because of their previous experiences with their countries' secret services.","No way, no how did I break into NORAD. That's a complete myth. And I never attempted to access anything considered to be classified government systems.","Our Constitution requires that the accused be presumed innocent before trial, thus granting all citizens the right to a bail hearing, where the accused has the opportunity to be represented by counsel, present evidence, and cross-examine witnesses.","If hackers, if anyone committing a criminal act, wants to reduce their risk, they obviously don't involve anybody else. The greater the circle of people that know what you're doing, the higher the risk.","I keep my stuff updated all the time. Being in the security industry, I keep up to date with securities.","I could have evaded the FBI a lot longer if I had been able to control my passion for hacking.","Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs founded Apple Inc, which set the computing world on its ear with the Macintosh in 1984.","Security is always going to be a cat and mouse game because there'll be people out there that are hunting for the zero day award, you have people that don't have configuration management, don't have vulnerability management, don't have patch management.","Computer hacking really results in financial losses and hassles. The objectives of terrorist groups are more serious. That is not to say that cyber groups can't access a telephone switch in Manhattan on a day like 9/11, shut it down, and therefore cause more casualties.","It's kind of interesting, because hacking is a skill that could be used for criminal purposes or legitimate purposes, and so even though in the past I was hacking for the curiosity, and the thrill, to get a bite of the forbidden fruit of knowledge, I'm now working in the security field as a public speaker.","For the average home-user, anti-virus software is a must.","Choosing a hard-to-guess, but easy-to-remember password is important!","To have transactions made on your web site via credit card, you must be PCI compliant. Businesses make the mistake of thinking that because you passed the requirements and are PCI certified, you are immune to attacks.","I don't condone anyone causing damage in my name, or doing anything malicious in support of my plight. There are more productive ways to help me. As a hacker myself, I never intentionally damaged anything.","There's a feature on Facebook where you can enable security that checks the device you're coming from. By default these features are likely off, but as a consumer, you can enable them.","I use Spam Arrest because of the amount of junk mail I get. Any legitimate person who wants to send me a message has to jump through hoops before they can be added to my opt-in list.","The Patriot Act is ludicrous. Terrorists have proved that they are interested in total genocide, not subtle little hacks of the U.S. infrastructure, yet the government wants a blank search warrant to spy and snoop on everyone's communications.","If I needed to know about a security exploit, I preferred to get the information by accessing the companies' security teams' files, rather than poring over lines of code to find it on my own. It's just more efficient.","Oracle, for example, has even hired people to dumpster dive for information about its competitor, Microsoft. It's not even illegal, because trash isn't covered by data secrecy laws.","The myth of Kevin Mitnick is much more interesting than the reality of Kevin Mitnick. If they told the reality, no one would care.","One of my all-time favorite pranks was gaining unauthorized access to the telephone switch and changing the class of service of a fellow phone phreak. When he'd attempt to make a call from home, he'd get a message telling him to deposit a dime, because the telephone company switch received input that indicated he was calling from a pay phone.","I'm not a fugitive anymore. Never will be in the future. After spending five years in jail, you learn your lesson. I never want to return there.","When an attacker fails with one person, they often go to another person. The key is to report the attack to other departments. Workers should know to act like they are going along with what the hacker wants and take copious notes so the company will know what the hacker is trying to find.","The government does things like insisting that all encryption programs should have a back door. But surely no one is stupid enough to think the terrorists are going to use encryption systems with a back door. The terrorists will simply hire a programmer to come up with a secure encryption scheme.","Both social engineering and technical attacks played a big part in what I was able to do. It was a hybrid. I used social engineering when it was appropriate, and exploited technical vulnerabilities when it was appropriate.","What I found personally to be true was that it's easier to manipulate people rather than technology.","The Internet is like the phone. To be without it is ridiculous.","It was used for decades to describe talented computer enthusiasts, people whose skill at using computers to solve technical problems and puzzles was - and is - respected and admired by others possessing similar technical skills.","Are hackers a threat? The degree of threat presented by any conduct, whether legal or illegal, depends on the actions and intent of the individual and the harm they cause.","My actions constituted pure hacking that resulted in relatively trivial expenses for the companies involved, despite the government's false claims.","I'm an expert witness in a case that's in appeal about a guy who allegedly misappropriated source code from a major, major company - he actually worked there and then apparently they found it on his laptop later.","We have problems with our physical security, operational security through to management.","Any type of operating system that I wanted to be able to hack, I basically compromised the source code, copied it over to the university because I didn't have enough space on my 200 megabyte hard drive.","So what I was essentially doing was, I compromised the confidentiality of their proprietary software to advance my agenda of becoming the best at breaking through the lock.","Of course I'm sure half the people there hate me and half the people like me.","I was pretty much the government's poster boy for what I had done.","So the ethic I was taught in school resulted in the path I chose in my life following school.","All they need to do is to set up some website somewhere selling some bogus product at twenty percent of the normal market prices and people are going to be tricked into providing their credit card numbers.","But a lot of businesses out there don't see the return on investment, they look at it as a liability, and until they can understand that proactive security actually returns, gives them a return on investment, it's still a hard sell for people.","Back in my day, I would probe by hand. Now you can get commercial software that does the job for you.","Some people think technology has the answers.","The perfect PIN is not four digits and not associated with your life, like an old telephone number. It's something easy for you to remember and hard for other people to guess.","I did get a huge endorphin rush when I was able to crack a system because it was like a video game.","I think malware is a significant threat because the mitigation, like antivirus software, hasn't evolved to a point to really mitigate the risk to a reasonable degree.","It's actually a smarter crime because imagine if you rob a bank, or you're dealing drugs. If you get caught you're going to spend a lot of time in custody. But with hacking, it's much easier to commit the crime and the risk of punishment is slim to none.","No company that I ever hacked into reported any damages, which they were required to do for significant losses. Sun didn't stop using Solaris and DEC didn't stop using VMS.","Once when I was a fugitive, I was working for a law firm in Denver.","I get hired to hack into computers now and sometimes it's actually easier than it was years ago.","I was an accomplished computer trespasser. I don't consider myself a thief.","My argument is not that I shouldn't have been punished, but that the punishment didn't fit the crime.","I get hired by companies to hack into their systems and break into their physical facilities to find security holes. Our success rate is 100%; we've always found a hole.","No company that I ever hacked into reported any damages, which they were required to do for significant losses.","I use Mac. Not because it's more secure than everything else - because it is actually less secure than Windows - but I use it because it is still under the radar. People who write malicious code want the greatest return on their investment, so they target Windows systems. I still work with Windows in virtual machines.","My hacking was all about becoming the best at circumventing security. So when I was a fugitive, I worked systems administrator jobs to make money. I wasn't stealing money or using other people's credit cards. I was doing a 9-to-5 job.","I was an accomplished computer trespasser. I don't consider myself a thief. I copied without permission.","I saw myself as an electronic joy rider. I was like James Bond behind the computer. I was just having a blast.","Being on the run wasn't fun, but it was something I had to do. I was actually working in legitimate jobs. I wasn't living on people's credit cards. I was living like a character out of a movie. It was performance art.","Businesses should absolutely set aside funding in their budgets for security consultants. Unless there is an expert on staff, and there usually is not, it needs to be outsourced.","What happens with smaller businesses is that they give in to the misconception that their site is secure because the system administrator deployed standard security products - firewalls, intrusion detection systems, or stronger authentication devices such as time-based tokens or biometric smart cards. But those things can be exploited.","Most people assume that once security software is installed, they're protected. This isn't the case. It's critical that companies be proactive in thinking about security on a long-term basis."],"Kevin Morby":["When I first moved to New York in 2006, I spent most of my time hanging out at and going to shows at a punk house in Crown Heights called The Fort where, amongst many roommates, my friend Johnny lived. Johnny loves The Germs, the legendary L.A. punk band fronted by the late, great Darby Crash.","I had a very easy middle class upbringing and never had to worry about anything. But my parents came from nothing and from broken homes, and their stories were always very interesting.","My dad grew up in western Nebraska. I'd visit all the time as a kid, and it's very much like the Wild West. It felt to me like a cowboy movie. Stuff like that made me become this dreamer at a young age.","I'm very impressionable: I get very taken away by stories and certain feelings. With writing, sometimes I want to feel like a character.","When I think about the most exotic, beautiful places, Porto is at the front of my mind. It's incredible, man. You have an idea of what Europe is like as an American, and people talk about Paris, Berlin and Stockholm, which are all great, but it wasn't until I went to Porto that I felt that idea of this exotic, beautiful, timeless place.","I'm a really big Fiona Apple fan, and more times than not, when I put her on in the car, people are surprised. I think they associate her less as a songwriter and more as a '90s MTV generation artist.","My hair - it's baby thin and feathery and drives me crazy no matter what I do with it. It's weird because you see people with thicker hair that just kind of stays put, but if I'm in any sort of weather, I look like Bill Murray in 'Kingpin' when it starts to all come unleashed.","Anytime I'm locked out of somewhere with another person, I can usually pick the lock successfully. And then I feel like James Bond.","'Rock Bottom Riser' by Smog - I was just in Europe, and my jet lag never really went away. I wasn't sleeping very much. Then one night, my girlfriend saw a Bill Callahan show in L.A. and took a video of that song and sent it to me. I was just listening to it over and over - it was comforting.","I write all the time, and I write a lot of songs, but before I started putting out records, those songs always just ended up on stuff that I did with The Babies.","I feel like 'Harlem River' was me putting one foot out the door of New York, and 'Still Life' is between Point A and Point B. It's the grey area.","One of my first observations about New York that I was so fascinated with was that you'd be at a stoplight, and you're with everybody; there's a homeless dude and some weird celebrity and a cop and someone who looks exactly like you.","I had a lot of jobs in New York. I worked in a cafe, and I did bike delivery, and I was a mover. And I babysat, which was really cool in some cases and really insane in others.","I wanted to write a song called '#1234' that would act as a homage to The Ramones.","I do not know what kind of relationship Jim Carroll and The Ramones had, though I imagine they all knew each other, as they ran in the same scene.","One of my favorite movie characters is Mother Sister from Spike Lee's 'Do The Right Thing.' It is such a beautiful name, and she is such a beautiful character, Mother Sister, the all-seeing eye over the block.","On 'City Music', I wanted there to be grit, and I wanted it to be loose, and I wanted there to be mistakes.","To be alive at all is so crazy, to experience the wide spectrum of feelings and emotions is so wild, but we have nothing else to compare it to, so it becomes normal.","I just love the idea of never seeing a city before and seeing the glow in the distance, and it just looking frightening, like you're driving into a fire.","You're at LaGuardia, and you get in a cab, and it's taking you into Brooklyn, and you're on the BQE, and you can see the skyline, the whole skyline, and it's so beautiful.","'Harlem River' is about the Harlem River in uptown Manhattan. I don't know much to say about it. I came upon that river a couple of years ago. I was doing a walk the length of Manhattan, from the top to the bottom, and I had never seen that river before.","'Reign' - and this might sound cheesy, but it's a dream I had. I dreamt everything that happened in that song, woke up, and wrote the song.","'Reign' is probably the oldest one on the record. I wrote that when I was 19. 'The Dead They Don't Come Back,' which is the last song on the album, I wrote when I was 20, and 'Harlem River' I just wrote last year. It spans from 2007 to 2012.","As far as dream venues, I've played all the venues I'd love to play.","I love Baltimore. It is a city with a giant heart and has remained one of my favorite places to keep returning to on tour. It is unique and beautiful, and you can't mistake it for anywhere else in the world - Baltimore is one hundred percent Baltimore.","Paris has always shown a lot of love towards my music, and I am very grateful.","On my first European solo tour, I was selling maybe 50 tickets a city until I showed up in Paris and heard the show was already at 150 tickets, which, at the time, really blew my mind and took me by complete surprise.","I remember my mom telling me that when John Belushi died, my dad cried. I remember thinking that was strange as a child, but today, I kind of get it.","I always considered myself a songwriter, but I didn't move to New York with plans of doing that; it just sort of happened. Everyone thinks that I moved to New York strictly to play music, but I totally just happened to fall into playing with Woods, and it all got started from there. I just went to New York to hang out.","My favorite songwriters are all solo artists.","I grew up in the Midwest and never really felt at home there, and when I got to New York, I was really fearless. I feel like I really fell in love with the the place. But then, it's a place where your world is really big at first and then becomes really small. I found myself hardly leaving my neighborhood, like I made it into a small town.","'Singing Saw' was exactly seeing through my eyes; 'City Music' let me write from somebody else's perspective, somebody living in New York.","A lot of what I've written that's made its way onto my records I've written in Kansas, which is interesting because I've never written about Kansas. But I go have these experiences. and I'll be back at my parents house, and it's like I'm in a safe incubator.","When I'm out having the experiences, that's exactly what I'm doing: having the experiences. Then I can later reflect and write."],"Kevin Nash":["I've always been into bodybuilding and keeping in shape, and I just challenge myself to see if I can continue to make improvements.","I'm a Detroit kid who grew up with that assembly line mentality: You go to work to make money.","When you do RAW or Wrestlemania or a PPV where there's 10,000 people or more, you don't necessarily look at the people. The only time there's a realization that there's that many people is when you walk to the ring. Once you get in the ring, your focus is only on the ring, and maybe the front few rows.","When my hair is dyed, I feel like I'm 35 again.","If you go to an ATM for a hundred dollars and it keeps spitting twenties, when would you walk away? When it wasn't spitting twenties no more. As long as you can take the money out, you'd stay there. That's what the wrestling business is like.","When you're in that upper echelon in wrestling, any movie you take is gonna be a pay cut. If you're gone for three months and they pay you 150 grand, you're getting killed.","I'm 53, and it's hard to get to the gym every day. If I know on Friday I'm going to be wrestling, then I don't want to look bad, so it gives me motivation. Plus, once you're in motion, it's a lot easier to stay in motion.","In professional wrestling, I think that they want you to be bigger than life. It's almost like an over-acting type thing - whereas on the big screen, you're 35 feet and they've got a close-up of you to put it on the screen in the movie house. At 35 feet, it's more subtlety than the overboard drama that we do in pro wrestling.","I'm one of those people who can't watch themselves do anything. I could never watch myself wrestle. I've probably watched a handful of my matches. I never could watch myself. Even when I played college basketball, I hated film days... 'Oh God, I'm gonna watch myself screw up.' I'm just one of those people who can't watch their work.","I'm so super-critical of everything that I do.","Everyone wants to call wrestling 'the business.' Why don't you treat it like a business? I don't care if you're running a diner, if you're running a car wash or a wrestling company. It's all business.","It's gone on my whole life, this David and Goliath syndrome that a lot of these smaller guys always have. They think the only reason I've ever had any success in my career is because of my physical size. And you know what? If that's the case, so be it. I really don't care. Because I have that size.","A guy my size needs a tremendous amount of protein on a daily basis, just to maintain peak size, strength, and performance. Basically, that means six or seven small meals a day, so I depend on protein supplementation.","Scott Hall is a great wrestler, a better friend, but more than anything a very caring human being. Scott never passed a homeless person or someone in need without opening his wallet. This is a guy that has the first two nickels he ever made.","The world is a mess. It seems that life gets harder on a personal level each and every day. Hug and kiss those you love every day. You never know when the tragedies of this world may visit your life."],"Kevin Nealon":["Don't play dead with a vulture. That's exactly what they want.","I became a vegetarian after I became aware of factory farming and slaughterhouses and the torture and inhumane handling of all these animals.","I think there's a part of me that might be my alter ago, like the carefree, do-what-he-wants kind of guy, because I've been so restrained most of my life, going to Catholic school and being the good son and the good husband. It's a fun escape route for me sometimes to lead that life.","I learned how to draw from being bored in school. I would doodle on the margins of my paper.","I loved working on 'Happy Gilmore' because I love to travel to new places and we got to go to British Columbia. Any Adam Sandler film is fun to work on because it is a reunion of the boys club of guys that have worked together in the past.","Every homeless puppy and kitten was born to parents who weren't spayed or neutered. I'm proud to support PETA's work to prevent animal homelessness.","My heart started running away, like a pack of horses. Then it slowed down and became irregular.","Any day that is designated to shower the person you love with love is my favorite holiday.","A lot of baby boomers are baby bongers.","I met Adam Sandler through 'Saturday Night Live,' and we became friends.","If people can't deal with their problems, they numb themselves a little bit.","I think people really appreciate clever commercials, as do I. I think they're very entertaining. You just have to wade through all the garbage. That's one of the reasons people watch the Super Bowl. A lot of them watch it to see the commercials and not the actual game.","A whole generation of people that didn't know me from 'SNL' recognize me from 'Weeds' now. People recognize me once in a while and appreciate the work. It gets a little embarrassing but it's good. If you work as an accountant, you don't have people coming up to you in the streets saying, 'Hey, great job on tax statements!'","I do have a place in my heart for animal shelters because the job they have is impossible - so many animals that need to euthanized because don't have homes for them.","I am very romantic. In fact, I just renewed my vows... although it was with another woman.","Curb Your Enthusiasm, is not so much about Hollywood. It's more about Larry's weaknesses.","I'm Kevin Nealon, and that's news to me.","If you want a transcript of tonight's program, get a pen and write down everything I said.","Workers insist that they are not disgruntled. They are very gruntled.","The funny thing about commercials to me is that many of them now don't even mention the product until the very end. You don't really know what the commercial is all about. They're kind of like little movies, like shorts, and that's why I think they're so entertaining.","When a show has been on for so long, you lose fans, you gain fans. I remember this from 'Saturday Night Live.'","I look back at 'Saturday Night Live' and I think, some people didn't like me doing 'Weekend Update.' Who cares? A lot of people did. When you're reaching that many people, you're not going to have everybody like you.","As a comedian, you're kind of like a blues musician; you have to live a little bit.","I really enjoyed working on the 2009 film, 'Aliens in the Attic,' because it was shot in New Zealand and I got to visit there for the first time.","When you discover that you are going to have a child, it stirs up memories of your own childhood.","I was born in St. Louis; I lived there for three weeks and then my father graduated from St. Louis University, so we all got in the car and split. I don't really remember much. I grew up in Connecticut most of my life and then four years in Germany. My father worked for a helicopter company, so we went over there.","What happened was, I always wanted to be a singer/songwriter kind of guy like a James Taylor or Crosby, Stills and Nash type of thing; I went to a lot of coffee houses and used to watch all those guys, but I never had the nerve to get up and do it because singing seems so personal and intimate to me. It was too revealing.","When I was very young, I didn't really write my own material. I just memorized other peoples' jokes. Established comics, like Stanley Myron Handelman and people like that. And then, for every comic, you develop your own style after a while.","It is a great rush to come up with a joke that gets a good response from the audience. It's gold!","I am whelmed, and not overly whelmed, just whelmed about a lot of facets in life - just how fragile life is and the different challenges you have in life, phobias about things.","I'm probably more of a stand-up comedian than an actor.","Never wear a red t-shirt to Target. I enjoy helping people, but not every two minutes.","I have a wandering eye and a lazy eye so they cancel each other out. It's a push.","I play a lot of sports. I'm not real good at any of them. I'm above adequate.","When I began doing stand-up, it took me a long time to get an hour's worth of material together.","A special validates you as a stand-up by documenting your material.","I grew up watching stand-ups and thought it was so entertaining and unique - you didn't see that as a job description anywhere.","When I first began doing TV pilots, my expectations were high. I didn't understand that world. So when 'Weeds' took off, I was so happy. Especially as I was just a guest star in the pilot. But once it got picked up, they made me a regular cast member.","When I would see my friends with their kids, I was envious that you can use children to get out of just about anything. If you don't feel like going to a dinner party, you could say, 'My kid's sick. I can't make it.' Who's gonna argue with you?","I see the love in my child's eyes when he sees me, and I know it's gigantic. As an older person, I've been in love before, and I've loved, but this is really an immense, out-of-control-proportion amount of love that you can't even describe.","It's kind of fun when you're playing characters that aren't quite on the up and up and people still like you.","As you get older, subconsciously you start thinking about mortality and protecting your offspring. It opens up a whole new avenue of life experiences.","Basically, I'm a people pleaser who has a knack for disappointing.","Standup really is a young man's game, a single young man's game. Even when I was younger, when I wasn't single, it was hard to be on the road because you go through relationships because your girlfriend kinda got tired of you being gone.","You really have to be ambitious and have that drive to really become well known and successful as a standup.","A novel is too much of a commitment. I tend to peruse Twitter - I check to see if I had any mentions and read the latest messages.","I have a severe addiction to 'Angry Birds.' I always tell myself, 'One more game...' But then there's always another and another and another.","I really like to read when I'm eating - 'The New York Times' or the 'Wall Street Journal,' paper version.","My adrenaline is definitely going, but it's mostly my real, laid-back persona carrying over on stage. When I first started, I was nervous, I'd be really high energy, and I'd be sweating. Now it's just my job. It's like a machinist who goes to work every day and uses the same drill bits. He's not worried about taking his finger off.","I think I definitely would have ended up in some kind of show business. I was very interested in music when I was younger. This was back when Crosby, Stills and Nash were around.","With music, you're laying it all out there. They're judging you right away, and you can lose them quick. With the comedy, you've always got another joke to redeem yourself. Or, even if you've only got one joke, at least the punch line is at the end. Then they have to at least pay attention until the end.","Sometimes people come to my standup show, and they think they're going to see Doug Wilson. Or they see me on the street, and they call me Doug Wilson.","I always tell people if you think you are susceptible to a blood clot, go check with your doctor.","To this day, I haven't felt like I've made it. I'm waiting for them to pull the rug out from under me. I kind of feel like George Plimpton; I'm just experiencing this whole business with the really talented people.","Every time I think of Doug Wilson, I think 'pathetic.' When it comes between something for himself or something for righteousness, he'll choose himself.","People recognize me once in a while and appreciate the work. It gets a little embarrassing, but it's good. If you work as an accountant, you don't have people coming up to you in the streets saying, 'Hey, great job on tax statements!'","I feel guilty: when I'm not golfing, I feel like I should be golfing. And when I'm golfing, I feel like I should be home working or spending time with the family. So it's a real conundrum.","I've done this commercial with Arnold Palmer. He doesn't play that much anymore, but it'd be fun to have him in the cart.","I'm a member of the Studio City Driving Range. They have a nice little par-3 AstroTurf course and driving range. You know, I don't belong to a course because I don't golf that much, so it's not worth it for me to join a club.","You see things through a different lens when you have a child.","The thing is when I started doing standup, you had to have a clean act because that's how you got on television. There weren't all these cable shows. Also, I didn't want to have that kind of act in case my family came to see me or my kid one day.","I recently purchased an iPad 2 because I didn't want to wait for the iPad 3 and iPad 4.","Print is definitely more nutritious. When I leave a website, I'm hungry again an hour later - especially the Chinese websites.","Definitely not a TV junkie. I only record shows I want to see but usually never get around to watching them.","I tend to listen to Sirius XM Radio.","I like YouTube; it's really entertaining. A lot of it is crappy stuff, but there are a couple diamonds in the rough there.","I've been involved in animal issues for quite a while, going back 24 years. I started reading up on factory farming and slaughterhouses and animal cruelty, and it didn't make sense for me to be part of it.","I just loved stand-up comics as a kid. I'd watch them on 'The Tonight Show,' and I thought what a great craft it was to come out on stage with no instrument or anything and be able to entertain people.","I don't feel the pressure and stress of having to be a comic in a club every night. I accomplished a lot of things; I did lot of things, and I don't feel like I'm missing out when I am home with my son.","I think having a child makes you calm down. You sit still.","I lived in Germany from when I was 6 until I was 10, so, of course, I played soccer. When I came back to the States, nobody played soccer, and none of the schools taught German, so I couldn't continue to excel in those categories.","It was football I enjoyed most. When I moved to L.A. to become a stand-up comedian, I thought it might be a good comedy hook to also be the punter for USFL club The L.A. Express, so I started practicing for the tryouts. Luckily, my stand-up took off, and I didn't need to do it.","I was 5-foot-8 when I graduated high school, but then I shot up to 6-foot-4 and got more into playing basketball.","I used to go to the Hollywood YMCA when I first came here, and I was standing in front of the mirror doing curls, and I noticed this guy next to me also doing curls. He was grimacing a lot, and I noticed he had an underbite. I looked more closely and realized it was Bruce Springsteen.","All I ever wanted to do was stand-up. It kind of charges me and gives me a rush.","I worked for a temp agency called Manpower.","You don't want to throw out a good idea and have nobody get excited about it. It takes the wind out of your sails."],"Kevin O'Leary":["Money is my military, each dollar a soldier. I never send my money into battle unprepared and undefended. I send it to conquer and take currency prisoner and bring it back to me.","So much of life is a negotiation - so even if you're not in business, you have opportunities to practice all around you.","When you're an investor, you can look at the quantitative and qualitative elements of an investment, but there's a third aspect: What you feel in your gut.","I'm not a tough guy. I'm just delivering the truth and only the truth and if you can't deal with it, too bad.","I'd rather invest in an entrepreneur who has failed before than one who assumes success from day one.","Unions are about the collective leverage, the power of numbers versus the power of capital.","When you bring an idea that has no merit to me, and you ask me to comment on it, I'm going to tell you it has no merit.","Don't cry about money, it never cries for you.","There's only one side with me. You get the right side. You get the correct version of the facts.","There's something very visceral about watching people beg for money. It's powerful.","My worst fashion faux pas: probably orange shoes with white pants. I thought I looked spectacular.","If you want a friend, buy a dog.","I don't mind rude people. I want people that I can make money with, so if their executional abilities are good, and they're arrogant and rude, I don't care.","You may lose your wife, you may lose your dog, your mother may hate you. None of those things matter. What matters is that you achieve success and become free. Then you can do whatever you like.","I have met many entrepreneurs who have the passion and even the work ethic to succeed - but who are so obsessed with an idea that they don't see its obvious flaws. Think about that. If you can't even acknowledge your failures, how can you cut the rope and move on?","Business is war. I go out there, I want to kill the competitors. I want to make their lives miserable. I want to steal their market share. I want them to fear me and I want everyone on my team thinking we're going to win.","The only reason to do business is to make money; that's the only reason for doing business.","Nobody forces you to work at Wal-Mart. Start your own business! Sell something to Wal-Mart!","There are a lot of impractical things about owning a Porsche. But they're all offset by the driving experience. It really is unique. Lamborghinis and Ferraris come close. And they are more powerful, but they don't handle like a Porsche.","Know everything about the companies and people you are going to be negotiating with. Insist on getting the names of everyone participating in the negotiations. Leave no stone unturned; find out as much as you can.","I'm not trying to make friends, I'm just trying to make money.","Here's how I think of my money - as soldiers - I send them out to war everyday. I want them to take prisoners and come home, so there's more of them.","My problem with unions is they breed mediocrity.","I think every entrepreneur in Canada owes the next generation a road map of how to do it again.","Working 24 hours a day isn't enough anymore. You have to be willing to sacrifice everything to be successful, including your personal life, your family life, maybe more. If people think it's any less, they're wrong, and they will fail.","Money equals freedom.","Money has no grey areas. You either make it or you lose it.","The practical reality of managing cars in the family - I do 36-month leases. I think they're horrible investments. And you want to give them back after their warranty is over.","You'd rather own gold; never own the miner.","If I were the president of the United States, I would make unions illegal. They no longer serve a functional purpose in democracy, in my view.","There are a lot of idiot fund managers out there who add no value to the process at all.","I'm starting to think about things that I want to do, things that are fun. One of them is driving a car like a Porsche. I've driven a lot of cars - sedans, trucks and big family vehicles all year long. But there's nothing like a four-wheel-drive Porsche.","Filming 'The Road to Riches' was surprisingly difficult for me. I learned that going back to career successes and failures can be emotionally exhausting as you are forced to revisit the euphoric highs and painful lows in high speed.","Being an employee is a bad outcome. You want to avoid that. Being an employee is never a good outcome. That's just an opinion.","If you put a woman in prison for four years when she's young and make her pay her time in a horrible place and she wants to come out and work, and become a mother and be a contributor to society and pay taxes and you never give her that chance. There is something un-Canadian about that.","I have had some great successes and great failures. I think every entrepreneur has. I try to learn from all of them.","For whatever reason somebody can be convinced to buy a PC, it opens up a whole new market for all of us in the software business.","I do not own a single security anywhere that doesn't pay a dividend, and I formed a mutual-fund company with that very simple philosophy.","All businesses require capital, management and labor, and business executives, wanting to grow and maintain profitable enterprises, have a strong incentive to keep costs, including labor, as low as possible.","Once in a while, I see my fellow TV investors praise a business just because they like the entrepreneur behind it. That kind of thinking might make you feel warm and fuzzy inside - but let's get back to reality.","I could have easily gone down the wrong path and dropped out of school, but I was given a second chance.","Don't call me, I'll call you... I'm out.","I'm not trying to make friends, I'm trying to make money.","I want to go to bed richer than when I woke up. The pursuit of wealth is a wonderful thing, but the thing is you have to be honest about it, you have to tell the truth.","When you come to 'Shark Tank,' the only person you should listen to is me, because you know you're getting the truth. I'll decide if it's worth it, and after I'm finished, the rest of the people can look into it.","I'm proud to be on the CBC and to see the management here represents both sides of every story. This is what's unique about the new CBC: you get a Kevin O'Leary on it when five years ago you wouldn't.","All we do is bring the debate from both sides, and let you as a viewer decide where you want to end up on the issue. That's very important. That's exactly what happens in 'Redemption Inc.'","You can't regulate a soul into a business.","If a man could give birth it would be to a book - it's an 18-month gestation period.","I think a book is your calling card, your business card.","People are aware of what I stand for through television. Nobody gets rich on TV but you build brand. That's what I'm attempting to do.","I remember failing reading in school at a young age, and you just kinda get left behind and I felt helpless.","When I turned 50, something clicked in my head and I said, 'I'm not going to live to 100. I'm half-cooked already.' I set the family down and I said, 'Listen everybody, we're now entering the decade of Daddy. We're going to start doing things that I want to do.'","If a manager can't control his costs, fire them.","I like gold because it is a stabilizer; it is an insurance policy.","Until Americans feel that their core asset - their homes - are stabilized, they are not going to have the animal spirits and they will continue to have less buying power.","Don't cry for money. It never cries for you.","Software is becoming no different than a videotape or a record album or a paperback book, and not all of us are ready for that change.","When you're travelling, your day is jam-packed. I just don't have time to whip out a PC all the time. But I can whip out a BlackBerry and tweet. I keep a constant diary of where I'm at and why I'm there.","As far as I'm concerned, Twitter has wiped out Facebook. I'm done with Facebook.","I keep anywhere between 5-10 percent of my net worth in venture ideas.","Once Michigan stood proud. In addition to GM, Ford and Chrysler, it was home base for the United Auto Workers, a powerful escalator transporting hundreds of thousands of blue-collar workers into America's middle class.","Many blue-collar families struggling to pay rent would be happy to skip paying optional union dues.","In his first term, President Barack Obama played a cautious manager navigating the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression and cleaning up the messes left by President George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan.","Having won re-election convincingly and against the economic odds, President Obama quickly made good on his promise of maintaining taxes as they are for the middle class while raising them on the wealthiest Americans.","Protecting Americans from harm goes beyond police and national defense. It's imperative that we not destroy the commons, the physical environment on which we rely.","A lot of people have said a lot of great things about Steve Jobs. And for good reason: he built the world's second-most valuable company, with billions in profits and products that have improved every aspect of our lives. But Steve didn't get there by being a soft, fluffy, Kumbaya-type leader.","Steve Jobs had his critics. Some saw him as an egomaniac, and others, as a control freak.","Imagine how foolish you'd look if, like one clever salesman who once pitched to me, you tried to license your product to a big industry player without knowing they just launched a competing product. With the right background research, he could have avoided that and other landmines - and so can you.","I look at Twitter as brand building.","Television is the most interesting hobby I've ever had.","Building fast-growing, globally competitive companies is tough.","We have to change public perception of ex-convicts. Most Canadians don't realize that when you come out of prison, you're a complete pariah. You can't get a car loan or money from a bank to start a business. So most end up back in prison within 24 months. It's just so wrong. We need to fix this problem."],"Kevin P. Ryan":["The best way to be productive is to have a great team. So I spend more time than most CEOs on human resources. That's 20 percent of my week.","I used to think business was 50 percent having the right people. Now I think it's 80 percent.","I heavily overinvest in recruiting. I have an understanding with certain search firms that if you find someone great, don't wait until there's a job opening - send him to me.","I don't have an office. I sit in a cubicle with everybody else. That's partly so no one can ask for an office, which in a fast-growing company isn't practical. But it's also so I can keep my finger on the pulse of how people are feeling."],"Kevin Patterson":["Solitude sharpens awareness of small pleasures otherwise lost.","The whole world loves a maverick and the whole world wants the maverick to achieve something nobler than simple rebellion.","Storms are sex. They exist alongside and are indifferent to words and description and dissection.","Because at bottom, I'm interested in fear, and in courage and cowardice and these are easier to get at through fiction, where you can enter people's heads.","I work on quiet call nights in the hospital, on airplanes and on my sailboat when I have a bit of time - I cram it into wherever it will fit.","I like a certain grandeur to a landscape, which both the Arctic and coastal BC have. I like it to be at all times clear that people aren't the dominant fact of a particular geography.","I've worked in the Inuit hamlets of the west coast of Hudson Bay since 1994. Over that time I've been very moved by both the pace of social change there - the loss of traditional ways of seeing the world, the affinity for and comfort with the land - and by the social disarray that change of this pace produces.","Medicine and writing are natural companions.","Mark Helprin and Lawrence Durrell, both of whom write fat and florid novels that appall me now but opened my eyes to the power of fiction when I was in my 20s."],"Kevin Peter Hall":["I'm not just somebody shuffling around in a monster suit. I'm a kind of puppeteer from the inside who is attempting through arm and body movements to give the creatures I play a sense of personality.","People know me because I play the monsters, but I'm most recognized from the small roles in which they see my face. None of that stuff really bothers me. Whether I'm recognized in or out of a costume isn't a kind of pressure I put myself through anymore.","When I first came to California, it was fun and exciting to get any part in any movie and get paid for it. Because of my size and my background, it seemed like I was right for just about anything."],"Kevin Pietersen":["I love living in London but I would like to buy a place in Dubai and spend a few months of the year out there.","Once you have the support of the lads around you, you can't ask for any more.","I hate these reality TV shows where people walk off Big Brother and think they're A-list celebrities when they've done nothing in their lives, it really does my head in.","People do write books.","It's tough being me.","No one in their right mind would turn down the contracts I've been offered.","I have principles in my professional and personal life as to how things are done.","During my time as England captain I have always been both helpful and direct in my communications with the ECB.","I'm always on my guard now.","There's so many differences of opinion in the papers.","I get along fine with the press.","I am very driven.","I can never sit still for five minutes.","In the past I've thrown my wicket away on certain occasions.","I think I had about a month off when I broke my rib in Australia, which was magnificent.","I'm not a robot.","The England team is a team that never, ever stops.","A good four to six weeks is about right for a proper break.","I'm very thrilled and excited to have been given the opportunity to captain England.","The only way to get a three to four-month break would be to tear a tendon or a hamstring or something like that.","I've had to calm down, I have a kid! It is amazing. It's the best thing ever. Nothing better than it.","When I was single I went out a lot. I don't go out all that often now.","Everyone is into male grooming.","I am very fortunate having the job that I do and I want to do it for as long as possible.","The hardest thing is that you can't trust people now. You just can't.","It's not fun facing a ball going 97 mph, trust me.","I never think of playing for South Africa. It's the furthest thing from my mind.","I have never been racist.","Big players want to play in front of big audiences.","I'm a very proud person.","I'm as hungry as ever.","I don't feel sorry for myself.","I always say that things are meant to be and everything happens for a reason, so I don't have any regrets.","My England captaincy was not the England captaincy I wanted, that's what will live with me for a long time.","I'd like to think that every captain around the world has a vision of how they want their teams to play and most of them are allowed to take their teams forward in their own way.","I love England and I love cricket.","India buzzes for its players and that makes you feel special.","Look, I've heard a lot of people talk about me, they say I'm like Marmite. They like me, or they don't like me.","I have no interest in anyone who wants to criticise me, or doesn't like me despite never having met me.","Leaving South Africa was very difficult.","I used to lie awake at night, willing myself to put in the hard work, the determination, the passion.","I need to rein myself in sometimes.","I am who I am, in terms of shooting from the hip occasionally.","I've realised I can be happy.","These days you can play almost 100 Test matches in six years.","I married a pretty famous girl, and when we drive through town there's usually a car following us, when I walk out of my front door in Chelsea there's six guys waiting for me.","I have some real big goals with England.","An achilles, if it doesn't heal right, there could be a danger of not playing again.","It's the weight of expectation that's the hardest to deal with, really, from my point of view.","It's quite hard when you do fail and you don't achieve what you want to achieve.","I change, like every single normal person."],"Kevin Plank":["Every great brand is like a great story.","I believe people change. I think that they can learn from mistakes.","Brand is not a product, that's for sure; it's not one item. It's an idea, it's a theory, it's a meaning, it's how you carry yourself. It's aspirational, it's inspirational.","The purpose of Disneyland is to make people smile.","I've always been a hustler.","We want to shine a light on this great city of Baltimore. I can tell you, I love this city.","I'm a big advocate of the power of positive thinking, particularly for small businesses.","Brands are about editing.","Your attitude is contagious.","Motivation, passion, and focus have to come from the top.","When you're winning, you're creating a dynasty.","Success doesn't happen quickly. It happens from doing the same thing over and over, becoming great at it, and delivering great value to consumers.","Before Under Armour, the only choices you had were to wear a short-sleeved cotton T-shirt in the summer or a long-sleeved cotton T-shirt in the winter. Why not make a better piece of equipment for underneath the shoulder pads?","The best merchants in the world aren't the ones predicting what's cool next; we're the ones dictating what's cool next.","Employees get things done. Partners get things done done. But owners get things done done done.","Winning, I believe, is a culture just as much as losing is.","Brands are all about trust. That trust is built in drops and lost in buckets.","People of Baltimore, if you want to simply learn a new trade, if you want to join the Foundry, it's a membership. It's like joining a gym, and you can go and meet other entrepreneurs like you. You can talk about how to get financing. You can take a class on how to sew. You can take a class and say, 'I want to be an electrician.'","The ability to touch people and literally change lives is incredibly relevant in a consumer-products company.","I want people to believe in themselves. I want intellectual curiosity. I want someone who realizes that they don't know it all and that they're dying to learn.","Randy Edsall is a good, strong, decent man who is working his tail off on behalf of the University of Maryland. And there are more people that want to spend their days burning things down than building it up. At least just stop rooting against him. You know, give the guy a chance.","All we're trying to do is change how people think about fitness. And build Under Armour into the biggest brand in the entire land.","We don't tell a 17-year-old kid that Nike sucks, because the fact of the matter is, Nike doesn't suck. They're actually very good at what they do.","I'm usually a pretty intense person. Give me an inch, and I'm going to go.","We need to stop making wide-body seats on airplanes, stop accommodating that, because it's not healthy.","It's key to become 'famous' for one thing first, and that will give you the credibility to go into other areas once your ready... which generally means a long time and a lot of perfecting!","There's no such thing as a good time. I started an apparel-manufacturing business in the tech-boom years. I mean, come on. Get out of your garage and go take a chance and start your business.","Stop with the stupid messages. I don't need a message that says, 'Go on, you can do it today.' What does that mean?!","I love Monopoly. You know why? When I play Monopoly with you, I'm going to buy everything from Baltic Avenue to Marvin Gardens. If you get to my side of the board, you'd better roll boxcars, or you're going to pay rent.","Maryland is one of the greatest schools that we have in this country.","I was always... naive enough to not know what I could not accomplish.","You're convincing these big, tough football players to wear what was essentially women's lingerie. There was a little bit of a Jedi mind trick that needed to take place. The product really spoke for itself once guys felt it and touched it.","At Under Armour, we've created a very strong culture, a culture that first and foremost is built on people.","Leadership is... to make sure you never limit the idea or opportunity.","I love Under Armour, and I would like stockholders to know that I am very committed to our company.","I wanted to make the world's greatest football undershirt. But I realized that no team sport had equipment for apparel. Apparel was an afterthought.","I was a general business major, which meant that in any business school and particularly at Smith School, which is a very good school, you do a lot of team projects. Well I was the guy who gave the presentations for the team projects.","It's a fire, it's a passion to get out and to create and to innovate. And that I've always enjoyed and I've always been very proud of is that the people I've done business with, the people around me have always made money.","I realized early on that I was pretty good at organizing. A lot of it was about control. While my friends were out getting hammered at concerts, I was making money. I am a control freak.","My first real business was bootlegging T-shirts - I was just a dumb kid. You go to a concert and pay $25 for a cotton T-shirt that says 'Rolling Stones,' 'Lollapalooza,' or whatever. On the outside they're 10 or 15 bucks. We were the guys selling them for 10 or 15 bucks.","You need to put your hands around the throat of your business, and you need to run it. There's no other way.","I was always telling people I was doing great, even if I wasn't.","I've got a pretty addictive personality.","The sports apparel industry was dominated by the big shoe companies. But there was a void in apparel and I decided to fill it.","When you see most companies get big, they want to shout about all they've done. But the consumer wants to know: 'What have you done for me lately?'","As foreign as it would be for you to go running in regular shoes, I want it to be just as foreign for you not to work out in your Under Armour.","My love of horses began in College Park, with me and 10 friends on two couches and a keg of beer in the back of a truck, heading to Pimlico at 6 A.M. to mark our place in the middle of the Preakness infield, where we never saw a horse run.","Any self-respecting entrepreneur has borrowed money from their mother at some point.","I wake up in the morning and I think about one brand. I don't have enough time to wake up twice and think about two.","People like being on winning teams.","Everyone must have a voice, and everyone deserves clarity.","In getting Under Armour started, like any business, I think, number one, you need a great idea.","The markets are efficient over time.","Data is the new oil.","The companies that do well are the companies that use math.","I don't want to be characterized as the big booster guy.","Great companies have to manage the cadence of what they do.","If I had been out in the industry instead of being a college kid who had an idea for another T-shirt, I would have been too scared to do anything.","I don't like my competition. At all.","I didn't like the way a wet cotton T-shirt felt under my equipment. There had to be something better.","The world cannot continue to build larger health care systems where you just sit around and wait for people to get sick.","If Facebook owns social, if LinkedIn owns business, who owns your health?","I don't have the option of getting fat. I like to try as much of our products as I can. Our sample size is size large, and I can't fit into our samples unless I'm at that size.","We don't care which products you like, but you should be using UnderArmour.com - which is now MapMyFitness - and having a reason to visit us every day.","We are not going to do ourselves any favors by buying into what's printed in newspapers.","There is some little boy and some little girl out there, somewhere, who believe that when they put Under Armour on, they can do just a little bit more.","In my industry, a shirt and a shoe are still made the exact same way they were 80 years ago.","I can't imagine trying to operate a company banking on the fact that my logo is cooler than somebody else's logo.","I don't believe in flagship retail, because the definition of flagship retail is that it's a marketing expense, and it's going to lose money.","Great brands are meant to be great aggregators.","My kids have been watching a lot of 'My Little Pony,' and it's rubbing off on me.","Blowing people's minds is one of my favorite things to do.","People say they'll pay more for something made in the U.S., but they won't actually do it.","If you're going to start a company, it's not going to be in the millions of dollars, but it's going to be something - for a lot of these kids - out of the trunk of their car, the same way that I did.","The Small Business Administration was fundamental in helping our company. There's great initiative from the government if you know the right places to look.","Wipe the tears away, stand up, be a man, run your business, find a way.","Everybody is an expert. But at Under Armour, I want people to control what they can control. Leave the pontificating to everyone else. Leave all that negative talk to everyone else.","People look great in leggings and shorts and athletic clothes.","Nothing ever surprises me about the market.","The idea of insider information to me is almost, like, laughable.","San Francisco is one of the worst-dressed cities in the world, bar none.","When I tell you it's an Under Armour T-shirt, your question should be, 'What's it do?'","I run five miles three times a week; I log everything.

I love energy.","Being green means preventing waste.","In getting Under Armour started, like any business, I think, number one, you need a great idea. But it's also about who you know.","I was a not-big-enough, not-fast-enough football player who wanted a little bit of an edge on the field. I figured my own sweat, if I could get that off my body, and more importantly, the weight that stood behind it, that would help.","Go find out if you can make your product. Once you make it, stop projecting what's going to happen and go find out whether your product can sell. Find out whether someone is willing to take hard-earned cash out of their pocket and exchange it for your product.","Don't ever, ever devalue your product. Ever. It's the worst thing anyone can do to hurt your brand.","I want Baltimore to be the coolest city in the world.","At some point in your life, you'll find yourself in a similar position: Surrounded by people who are smarter, faster, who have more experience and more money - and you'll just have to find a way. And you'll have to do it with passion.","Passion means finding a way."],"Kevin Pollak":["As rewarding as a good film role can be, there is just nothing like getting up on a stage and taking an audience for a ride.","I am completely and utterly hooked to all the great shows on A&E and Court TV that are about small town murder.","If I have anything to offer as an actor, it's only my ability to make the person real.","I think it's important that your first film be your worst film, that one's life trajectory should go up.","And Barry Levinson is insanely funny.

I think vets on the whole want the same things that everybody else does.","Noises and smells, those can bring back powerful memories. I remember when I was going to school one Fourth of July, and there were a lot of fireworks going off. I knew that I was in Richmond. I knew that I was a college student. But I thought people were shooting at me.","I know that the writers I read and admire all have an influence on my work, but trying to determine to what degree any particular piece of input changes the way I think about writing seems counterproductive.","My personal opinion is that if someone writes honestly about war, it will inherently be anti-war.","Writing was always an aspiration, but I'd kept it a secret even from myself.","The male role models I had all seemed to have been in the military. My father served in the army. My uncle was in the Marine Corps. Both of my grandfathers served in WWII. There weren't any career soldiers in my family, but when I was young it seemed like a way of arriving at adulthood.","Joining the military is not to be taken lightly. You're putting every part of yourself at risk, not just your body but your moral and spiritual centre.","I've been writing poems and stories since I was about 13.","I'm always most interested in writing about things that I don't understand.","I understood that 'The Yellow Birds' would be a peculiar representation of the experience of being at war. I intended it to be so.","As human beings, we have the blessing and the curse that we're able to adapt to almost anything. No matter how extreme the circumstances you're in, they become normal.","I understand that it's incredibly difficult to watch what's happening on the news every day and not become inured to it. I've fallen victim to that myself, wanting to look away.","One of the things my service in Iraq did give me was this freedom from fear of failure or any kind of expectations that I had to take a standard path.","I can't envision an honest war novel that left war in a positive light.","I guess I find the boundaries between poetry and prose to be somewhat permeable.","Poetry and prose are of equal importance to me as a reader, and there doesn't seem to be much difference in my own writing.","I wasn't a good student in high school. I wanted to go to college, but they weren't exactly beating down my door to offer me admission, and it's so expensive in the U.S. If you join up for a period, the army will pay your school and provide a stipend.","It's not just: you get off the plane, you're back home, everything's fine. Maybe the physical danger ends, but soldiers are still deeply at risk of being injured in a different way."],"Kevin R. Stone":["Drinking water is like washing out your insides. The water will cleanse the system, fill you up, decrease your caloric load and improve the function of all your tissues.","My job as a surgeon is not just to fix a joint, but to give my patients the encouragement and tools they need to speed up their recovery and leave my clinic better than they have been in years.","Think about what caused the injury and how it can be prevented next time; that way, you will become a smarter athlete and less likely to repeat the same mistakes.","Never, ever exercise in front of a TV or while reading. You lose 50 percent of the benefit of the exercise by not hearing and feeling your heart rate, your sweat and the pain levels that need to be encountered in fitness training."],"Kevin Rahm":["The industry has a very short memory of what's possible, and they like to typecast you.","My intent was to go to law school... And then what I realised quickly is what I wanted was to be on L.A. Law.","I watch way too much television and like a lot of shows, so I'm always excited to meet those people and hope they're not douchey.","I think any workplace relationship is dangerous. That's been my personal experience. They haven't always worked out the best. But I know other people for whom it worked out great.","I have my belief structure, and it's very important to me, but people start associating that with you, and you become that. I want to be judged for my work.","I started out in pre-law. I was going to go to law school. And I saw a production of 'Tally's Folly' that spring term. I took a theater class that term and auditioned for 'Harvey' at the end of the summer, and I was in a play every semester after that.","I love comedy and did a lot of comedy in college. I was in an improv comedy group with my friends.","I loved comedy, but I never saw myself as a sitcom guy. I envisioned myself doing an hour drama or doing movies.","I've been lucky in the sense that I haven't become famous."],"Kevin Reilly":["I love TV. Always have. Since my mother told me to stop sitting so close and watching so much.","I remember coming up in the business and seeing how the grind turned some executives into grizzled cynics. And I vowed to never become that guy. I have always believed it's incumbent upon network brass to bring a wide-eyed optimism to the chairs they rent. Talent deserves that. And frankly, the jobs are just no fun otherwise.","While I felt like we potentially had something really huge in 'Gotham,' you're always nervous that it won't live up.","When you get these franchises with some built in profiles and anticipation... I think the anticipation and the buildup can can exceed the delivery.","Unfortunately, there is no 'X Factor U.S.A.' without Simon Cowell.","Before there was cable, Fox was cable.","Trying to make programs that are all things to everyone is not going to work.","I've spent a lot of time encouraging, corralling, protecting, and sparring with creative people.","One of the things I truly enjoy about my job is the dynamic nature of having a foot in each world - the world of the talent, who create our product - and the world of our business in which we market, distribute, and monetize that product.","I love talent because they are passionate. They can be emotional and irrational and unpredictable... and that's okay, because all we want is something exciting on the page and on the screen.","Success is often built on the shoulders of failure - from which new configurations emerge.","If what you're doing today isn't vital, you're certainly not going to have a seat at the table in determining what's going to happen tomorrow.","I still love a great pilot as much as I did the day I started at NBC.","Whether Amazon is good at making and sustaining an entertainment business remains to be seen. But they certainly are 100% focused every day on optimizing the consumer experience and reducing friction.","As the media landscape continues to evolve, 'Conan' will continue to lead the evolution of what a talk show will be in the digital age.","We're in the culture business. You are constantly monitoring cultural shifts, current events, shifts in mores, things that reflect society, and, at times, we try to drive it.","'The Walking Dead' is an extraordinary thing.","There are not going to be hundreds of cable networks doing original programming; they won't be able to sustain the model.","'Surviving Jack' was actually a really nice show that was very well-run creatively.","The biggest move that put Fox on the map, from an entertainment perspective, was when 'The Simpsons' moved to Thursday night, and that was paired with 'Martin' and 'Living Single.'","Rather than make 20 things and throw them at the wall and hope you get 6 that maybe feel like keepers, why not focus?","Narrative storytelling is wired into our humanity.","I'm trying to be a broadcaster and have a big cultural impact.","Trying to find big hits has always been a needle-in-a-haystack endeavor.","I'm a believer in broadcast.","It's very nice to be part of an organization that you enjoyed and respected.","How people watch and the different ways they connect to TV - you're going to see some expansion and radical transformation.","Nobody watches commercials if you ask them. Nevertheless, they watch commercials.","Every television show is hard to do, but when you're in genre and you're recreating worlds and mythologies, they're particularly hard.","One thing that cable has done is trained the audience that, when a TV show is on, it should be on.","'Friday Night Lights' was never a break-out hit; I'll never regret doing that show.","The one thing that I'm really obsessed with is multi-camera comedy. It is a form that is unique to network television.","The 10 million views on YouTube are... worthless to us as a business.","It's always a good problem to have to hear people saying they want to see more.","When you start to feel you're not coming to work with the same enthusiasm, maybe you shouldn't hang onto that job.","I love my job, but I'd really love my job if I didn't have to live and die by ratings every day.","What the hell is pilot season? It's an artificial boundary that makes no sense, and it makes you do things under duress.","Fox was the challenger to cable before there was cable.","People love television; they're watching a lot of it in a lot of ways.","I've respected the people that I've worked for, and they've been supportive and respectful of me.","You always want to trust talent; that's the best thing.","I, for one - I'm not a believer that, now that the Facebooks and Googles and everyone is entering the content fray, that it's a foregone conclusion that they're just going to get it right and be amazing at it. It's really hard.","TV has always been a dog-eat-dog game.","The resilience of narrative storytelling and people's love affair with television is impressive.","Creating more direct relationships with consumers, utilizing the resulting data and insights, is increasingly more valuable - and an evolution of the traditional competency of ad-supported television networks.","Some of the greatest shows in history - 'Seinfeld,' 'Everybody Loves Raymond' and 'House' - had puny starts but the benefit of schedule protection, increasingly scarce in today's DVR world. Cable nets can tolerate small ratings, building hits in progress like 'Breaking Bad,' or marathon their way to a 'Duck Dynasty.'","The way television is done, you're kind of set on a certain path, and then episodic directors come in every week to try to recreate that.","I do believe that the audience is capable of embracing quality. But a lot of times, they'll be like, 'Why isn't there ever anything good on TV? Put something good on.' 'Uh, if you watched this, it would help.'","I always believe that if you stick with quality and give people a chance at the time, that people eventually get on board with it. It's been my experience more than not. Once in a while, there's a show that you just can't seem to break through on.","Pilots are useful. You just learn things during a pilot - the piece of casting that just wasn't right or things about the storytelling nature.","Producing a drama is particularly difficult.","Producing a one-hour show that has to reinvent musical numbers, and interpret those musical numbers with a large cast, is difficult.","'Glee' is produced with three people and written by three people. In my mind, I don't believe there's any other show on television that was written by three people. The fact is there are shows that have 14, 15, or 16 people writing them.","Is The 'X Factor' the mother of all shows? Absolutely!","It used to be a given that the talent and the talent agencies would line up around the broadcast pitch season first and then take whatever was still available out to cable. I hate to say it, but it's just not going down that way anymore. There are things that are bypassing the broadcast networks altogether.","Creative content is challenging, no matter what, and animation is particularly challenging.","'Fringe' has been a point of pride. I share the passion for the show that the fans have.","As an industry, when you're in the talent business, we are way too obsessed on the competition with each other and not enough with the consumer.","It's really the rare creator who can tell you where he's going to end the season of 22 episodes. That's not bad. That's part of the creative exploration.","NBC, for me, is like the crazy ex-wife that I can't get away from.","TV has so many access points, so many availabilities. DVR, binge viewing."],"Kevin Richardson":["The coal mining industry is very destructive and it doesn't have to be.","I remember lying on the floor of the living room with headphones on when I was four or five years old, listening to the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack.","For example, colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Every four minutes someone is diagnosed, and every nine minutes someone dies.","I've always loved music, not necessarily just the Osmonds.","At Christmas our house is like a Donnie and Marie Christmas Special.","But I would lie on the floor and analyze everything. I'd listen to all the strings and the background vocals on the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack and try to pick out the different instruments.","Cancer is just a horrible disease.","Coal companies have a lot of power in the media, and unfortunately a lot of information doesn't get out.","Florida has tons of entertainment opportunities because Walt Disney World and Universal Studios are there.","I am not a tree-hugger and I don't think mine is an extreme point of view.","I believe as human beings we are out of balance, out of synch with the earth.","I did Chicago on Broadway the year before last. That was a great opportunity and I had a blast.","I had been singing all my life, but I started acting in high school.","I have been reading scripts, going to auditions and looking for the right opportunities.","I have been taking classes and I'm familiar with stage, but I'm not as familiar with acting on camera.","I just moved to Florida to seek out opportunities.","I sang in church choir all my life, through elementary school, junior high and high school.","I started playing in the band and learned to play piano by ear.","I wanted to help raise awareness, so I created an environmental foundation called Just Within Reach.","I wasn't originally taking drama, but the drama teacher asked me to audition for Bye, Bye Birdie. I did and got the lead role. Initially I was kind of scared, but once I did it I got bitten by the bug and loved it.","If we can get kids talking about conservation and doing it, they can have a great influence on their parents by lecturing them and pointing the finger.","In musical theater you have to be very big and very animated, while film and television are more toned down.","My grandfather was in a barbershop quartet and my grandmother was in a gospel quartet with her sisters.","My mom sang in high school choir and so did my father.","Once colon cancer becomes symptomatic, nine times out of ten it is too late.","Prior to that I testified before the Senate subcommittee addressing mountaintop removal.","Quite a few movies are starting to film in Florida.","So if people will pay attention to what I say because of our success as a group, I am going to use that.","They wanted to do a movie about the Backstreet Boys.","We can have technology, prosperity, nice homes and cars, but at the same time we must be conscious of what we are dumping into the water, the air and our food.","We're not saying that you don't need coal, but when you do mine the coal there are responsibilities to it. It may cost a little more, but it is the right thing to do."],"Kevin Rollins":["When I was growing up there was a product made by Sony called the Sony Walkman - a rage, everyone had to have one. Well, you don't hear about the Walkman anymore.","Consumer electronics is a challenging one.","It might take some here and there, but Apple's market share in the global computer business has really shrunk pretty far, and where they've been making success recently is not in the computer business but in the iPod music business.","We think we have a responsibility. And I think it's important for all of us in the Western world to realize that we've all been blessed a lot and if you go to these parts they don't have a lot, even before the tsunami.","And our size: The company this year is going to be close to $50 billion, so if that's the case and you can continue to grow that fast, I would rather put my energies to solving customer problems and growing our business than worrying about integrating and laying people off.","Everyone wants to talk about it, and right now music, flat-panel televisions, a whole host of new handheld devices are fun to talk about and very exciting to look at.","I am sure there will come a time when we are going to use AMD. The products have been getting better. The acceptance is getting better. But we have not been suffering as a company for either growth or profitability because we haven't had AMD.","I believe that one-product wonders come and go.","I think right now the jury is out on where and how much profit is available in the consumer electronics industry, because if you look at the current consumer electronics players, the biggest ones on the planet struggle to make profit consistently.","I'm the one who made many of the bold comments that we'd seen the technologies from AMD as pretty good. Their technology in many areas was leading. But those are transient.","Intel's still our main partner. We have not announced anything with AMD and don't have anything planned, but we're constantly being aware to make sure our customers get the best technology.","Most of the services staff is for the larger corporations, not so much for small and medium businesses because they cannot afford an extensive services army.","Our goal is to leverage what is already out in the field in terms of partners, but then hire in project management capability and a bit of technical capability.","Over the last several quarters we have been growing faster in Asia and Europe than any other place on the planet. We have 18 percent of the global PC share, about 12 percent in Europe, and 8 percent in Asia.","So when we go into a large hardware bid, there is usually a services component that is part of that. So as we enter these deals, we tend to talk about the capabilities and what else needs to be done, and from there the bid might expand beyond hardware to the services.","The weakness in the company is if we fail to execute.","There would not be enough talent that's educated, developed and ready to take on the next leadership challenge, and it would cap our growth. Now we've put programs in place not to have that happen, but that could be a weakness.","We are No. 1 worldwide by quite a margin on the client side and expanding, according to IDC and others, every single quarter. Our expectation is that the industry will consolidate and that more of our competitors will exit.","We own 18 percent of just the PC business. Now that's only about 60 percent of our business today.","Well, you would have to say what is the criteria to determine the success of any merger? It would have to be that the companies are stronger financially, that they took market share, and they are on a very steady footing in terms of their performance.","What we learned several years ago was that one of our weaknesses would be if we didn't develop enough people with the know-how to run our company, it would come to the point where we would just stop.","You cannot have companies where many of the largest ones lose money indefinitely without someone finally waving the white flag, and IBM is the most recent example of that."],"Kevin Rose":["One of the things that I've always loved to do is brainstorm ideas with friends and get together and talk about what they're building... Essentially, my day-to-day is just going around and meeting entrepreneurs and talking to them about what they plan on launching.","Twitter became a major place to find out what was breaking on the Internet. Facebook became a place to share links. Social media really grew up.","At our peak, no one knew how to value Digg.","I want to be known as one of the most accurate investors that ever lived.","I focus on consumer Internet. Sometimes it's a working prototype; sometimes it's an idea on a napkin. I don't do a ton of deals a year, and I really like working with startups - it's the only way I can invest. It fits my ADD brain.","The key to making money in angel investing is saying no. You meet with 100 companies and say no to 99 of them.","Since news breaks on digg very quickly, we face the same issues as newspapers which print a retraction for a story that was misreported. The difference with digg is that equal play can be given to both sides of a story, whereas with a newspaper, a retraction or correction is usually buried.","We want to open digg up to just about anyone and everyone that wants to express their interest in any type of news story or Web content.","People want to have a voice and a say in what is news.","The democratic approach to news is a very valuable thing. We're always going to be dependent on the quality of reporting of mainstream media.","Digg will serve as a means of gathering metrics for third party websites, providing them insights into who's digging their content, who they are spreading it to.","With Digg, users submit stories for review, but rather than allow an editor to decide which stories go on the homepage, the users do.","Digg is like your newspaper, but rather than a handful of editors determining what's on the front page, the masses do.","One of the things that's been crazy for us has been the speed at which news can break on Digg, because it's powered by a mass of humans versus a machine that has to go out and crawl and find the information and then determine its relevance mathematically.","My background is in tech. I studied computer science, and was working on TechTV, so the first thing I wanted to do was see my favorite motherboard stories hit the front page; you know, like, really geeky stuff.","We have a huge tech following that do nothing but Digg tech stories, and then there's another pool of users that remove the tech section from their view of Digg, because you can go on and customize your own experience and remove sections you don't like."],"Kevin Rudd":["We apologise for the laws and policies of successive parliaments and governments that have inflicted profound grief, suffering and loss on these our fellow Australians. We apologise especially for the removal of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their families, their communities and their country.","Australia is a nation of compassion. Courage and compassion. And the third of these great values: resilience.","The Apology opened the opportunity for a new relationship based on mutual respect and mutual responsibility between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia. Because without mutual respect and mutual responsibility, the truth is we can achieve very little.","There is a reason why the cultures of Indigenous Australia inspire such fascination. And that is that they represent a unique way of thinking about the world. A vision that over tens of thousands of years has risen out of the land, the power, the very being of our continent, Australia.","As nations we should also commit afresh to righting past wrongs. In Australia we began this recently with the first Australians - the oldest continuing culture in human history. On behalf of the Australian Parliament, this year I offered an apology to indigenous Australians for the wrongs they had suffered in the past.","I am deeply committed to the cause of Indigenous Australians, and not just because of the Apology, but the big challenges which lie ahead in closing the gap.","My fundamental interests are to preserve the good name and standing of this Australian Labor Party and to act in the national interest on behalf of the Australian Government.","Something my mum taught me years and years and years ago, is life's just too short to carry around a great bucket-load of anger and resentment and bitterness and hatreds and all that sort of stuff.","Because the time has come, well and truly come, for all peoples of our great country, for all citizens of our great commonwealth, for all Australians - those who are indigenous and those who are not - to come together to reconcile and together build a new future for our nation.","We are so fortunate, as Australians, to have among us the oldest continuing cultures in human history. Cultures that link our nation with deepest antiquity. We have Aboriginal rock art in the Kimberley that is as ancient as the great Palaeolithic cave paintings at Altamira and Lascaux in Europe.","The Government's mission is to build a strong and fair Australia capable of meeting the new challenges of the 21st century.","There comes a time in the history of nations when their peoples must become fully reconciled to their past if they are to go forward with confidence to embrace their future.","If the states and territories do not sign up to fundamental reform, then my message is equally simple: we will take this reform plan to the people at the next election - along with a referendum by or at that same election to give the Australian Government all the power it needs to reform the health system.","We are moving toward recognition of the first Australians in the Australian constitution.","To be a member of the Labor Party is to be an optimist - optimistic about the future of Australia, optimistic about the ability of government to make a difference.","What we have seen in financial markets should bring home to us all that the central organising principle of this 21st century is interdependence. For the century just past, interdependence may have been one option among many. For the century that is to come, there is no longer an alternative.","It is a high honour to be elected Prime Minister of Australia.","We have a prime minister, I'm the foreign minister, I'm trying to get on with the job of doing Australia's foreign policy.","Well Australia's been in Afghanistan from the get go, way back in 2001, but we have been resolute throughout and with support from both sides of Australian politics.","So in terms of the global economic footprint, let's just say China within the next decade and a bit is likely to emerge as the world's largest economy. Obviously its foreign policy and security policy footprint increases and that creates both challenges and opportunities for us all.","As you know, the Australian Labour Party is committed to turning the country into a republic. We've not stipulated a timeline for doing that. We are sensitive to the other priorities we've got as a nation and in the world, but in time the country will head in that direction.","There is a deep affection in Australia for the Queen. And I mean the Queen's been the Queen ever since I was born. I mean she is part of the firmament of Australia's sort of national life; there's a deep respect for her role.","I'm out there arguing the Labor case. I will do it anywhere and everywhere that I can. I do it within various communities across Australia where I am able to make a positive contribution. And let me tell you, my voice won't be silenced in the public debate because the issue at stake for Australia are so stark.","Ladies and gentlemen, it is with great sadness that I announce that I will resign as Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs. I am sad because I love this job. I'm totally dedicated to the work that we are doing in Australia's name around the world, and I believe that we have achieved many good results for Australia, and I'm proud of them.","I deeply believe that if the Australian Labor Party, a party of which I have been a proud member for more than 30 years, is to have the best future for our nation, then it must change fundamentally its culture and to end the power of faceless men. Australia must be governed by the people, not by the factions.","Australians are a passionate lot. We are also a very practical lot.","But Australia faces additional regional and global challenges also crucial to our nation's future - climate change, questions of energy and food security, the rise of China and the rise of India. And we need a strong system of global and regional relationships and institutions to underpin stability.","A core challenge for Australia is - how do we best prepare ourselves for the Asia Pacific century - to maximise the opportunities, to minimise the threats and to make our own active contribution to making this Asia-Pacific Century peaceful, prosperous and sustainable for us all.","If Australia wants an effective United Nations, we have to be comprehensively, not marginally, engaged.","The Australian Government's decision to take on the dominant funding role for the entire public hospital system is designed to: end the blame game; eliminate waste; and to shoulder the funding burden of the rapidly rising health costs of the future.","With the Australian Government paying more of the hospital bills, it will have the incentive to make sure people are treated through less expensive and more appropriate primary care services.","Building a new Health and Hospitals Network is fundamental to building a stronger and fairer Australia.","2009 was a tough year, but Australia rose to the challenge of the global financial crisis. It shows what can be done when we all join together and work together, governments of all persuasions state, territory and local; businesses large and small; unions and local communities right across the nation.","On Australia Day 2010, as we enter this second decade of the 21st century, Australians can be optimistic about our future, but we cannot afford to mistake optimism for complacency.","By 2050, the Australian population is expected to grow from 22 million to 36 million. That increase alone will put huge pressure on our towns and our cities. We will need more homes, more roads, more rail lines, more hospitals, more schools, just to accommodate so many Australians.","The Australia to 2050 report highlights something that is well understood by South Australians, that infrastructure plays a key role in long-term economic expansion.","A continuing narrative throughout Australia's history that says it is better to build up than to tear down - this is the continuing mission of Labor.","There are many who criticise the United Nations. And those of us who know this institution well know that it is not immune from criticism. But those who argue against the United Nations advance no credible argument as to what should replace it. Whatever its imperfections, the United Nations represents a necessary democracy of states.","The stability of global financial markets is a public good. If governments fail to protect this public good, then those who suffer are the working people of the world whose jobs, whose homes, and whose standard of living depends on it.","I am determined to honour the confidence which has been extended to us by the people of our great land. And I say to all of those who have voted for us today, I say to each and every one of them that I will be a prime minister for all Australians.","I was elected by the people of Australia as Prime Minister of Australia. I was elected to do a job, I intend to continue doing that job. I intend to continue doing it to the absolute best of my ability. Part of that job has been to steer this country through the worst economic crisis the world has seen in 75 years.","These are important reforms. Infrastructure, education, health, hospitals, closing the gap with indigenous Australians. Also the Apology to the first Australians. As Prime Minister of the country I am proud of each and every one of these achievements.","I conclude where I began, I was elected by the people of Australia to do a job. I was not elected by the factional leaders of Australia, of the Australian Labor Party to do a job - though they may be seeking to do a job on me, that's a separate matter. The challenge therefore is to honour the mandate given to me by the Australian people.","I've been around long enough to not take seriously statements like I am about to be crushed. I'm about how do we seek re-election of the Australian government, how we prevent Tony Abbott from being elected. The bottom line is that it should be all hands to the pump rather than saying other, frankly negative and internally divisive things."],"Kevin Schmidt":["I learned how to eat right and learned portion control and how to exercise. Staying persistent over the years, I have been able to change the way I'm perceived on the outside.","I've been home-schooled since I was in the fifth grade, mainly because I had two brothers who were acting. We were from Kansas but moved out to Los Angeles.","It was actually my older brother who wanted to start acting. He would point at the TV as a kid and tell my mom he wanted to do it, and he would act his favorite scenes from 'Home Alone.'","I have my writing and acting and producing and directing, and my younger brother has his music and his acting.","When I was a little younger, I realized acting is a wonderful craft, and it's wonderful when you are working.","I have my character actor side as a kid and my more leading man side. It's all been beneficial."],"Kevin Shelley":["I hold myself to a very high standard, and I hold my contributions to that same high standard. I will not accept any contributions that are illegal, inappropriate or tainted.","I personally apologize to any person who felt anything less than respected and valued by myself.","If I could have anything right now, it would be the ability to continue as secretary of state.","Throughout my life, I have always tried to do what is right.","I do not go lightly. If I could have anything right now, it would be the ability to continue as secretary of state.","While I have made errors that I deeply regret, I have never, ever done so with the intent of subverting the law or of benefiting myself.","I'm insisting, quite unapologetically, on the need to have these appropriate security measures in place to protect the voters, which is my principal charge."],"Kevin Smith":["Everybody's got one killer story. It doesn't take talent to tell that story, it just takes experience.","When you're a filmmaker you're part of a very expensive art form.","It's kind of debatable whether or not the advertisement model is effective. Like whether Nielsen works. For years, Nielsen has been based on sampling. It's not like an electronic bullet that hits your house that tells the people at networks at all times what you're watching.","Don't let anybody tell you different, man: The main goal in life careerwise should always be to try to get paid to simply be yourself.","I think: 'Wouldn't it be great to work with Bill Murray?' And then I'm like, 'You know what, just appreciate Bill Murray from afar, don't find out that maybe he's not the dude you want to work with.'","There's something to be said for failing. It's not the failure you feel, it's the failure that people project when something disappoints. You're back to ground zero, where there's no expectations, and that's where I like to be.","It's too expensive, that's the thing nobody wants to talk about. It is too expensive to make movies. That's not true, it is too expensive to market movies. Making movies is not.","I didn't get into film to win Academy Awards. I wanted to have a conversation with the audience.","The writer crafts their ideal world. In my world, everyone has really long conversations or just picks apart pop culture to death and everyone talks in monologue.","Storytelling is my currency. It's my only worth. The only thing of value I have in this life is my ability to tell a story, whether in print, orating, writing it down or having people acting it out.","The only thing of value I have in this life is my ability to tell a story, whether in print, orating, writing it down or having people acting it out. That's why I'm always hoping society never collapses because the first ones to go will be entertainers.","All these people who say success changes people; well, no, it just magnifies what's there.","It's kind of debatable whether or not the advertisement model is effective. Like whether Nielsen works.","Any book is a self-help guide if you can take something from it.","I've always kind of ripped from real life to some degree or at least how I'm feeling in the moment.","If you're lucky, you go from being a movie fan to a movie maker.","I always wanted to see if I could sell a movie to the public without doing any marketing because my philosophy was like, 'Hey man, I'm reaching my audience everyday. I'm twittering with them. I'm in direct contact with them on the podcast.'","I'd see movies, comedies, and I loved 'Animal House', I loved all the John Hughes stuff, but I never saw me and my friends totally represented.","Long time no see. I only pray the caliber of your questions has improved.","I grew up in a pretty gay world - my brother's gay and he's been married to a man for 20 years, which is like 60 in straight-people years.","I know what it feels like to carry a lot of weight in a society that's very image-conscious. It's a thin person's world, and we try to navigate within it without being made fun of.","It's taken me 15 years to step behind a camera and make something everyone agrees looks like a movie.","Indie film isn't dead, it just grew up.","I sympathize far more with heavier people than I ever will with thin. I'll never be thin. Let's be honest.","It's like a dream come true. When somebody is paying you to talk about yourself, you've won.","It's silly that anyone in this world tells you that there are only certain people that can marry you.","Dudes know I'm not a threat. Chicks know I'm not a threat.","In Hollywood you just fail upwards.","I've always kind of ripped from real life to some degree or at least how I'm feeling in the moment. In fact, maybe that's really it. In anything I've ever written, all the characters sound like me, which I don't think is a bad thing.","Haven't two hundred years of failed missionary work overseas taught anybody anything? You can't convert people to anything - whether religion, or something as inane as our flicks.","People like to set the bar high. I like to put the bar on the ground and barely step over it. I like to keep the expectations really low.","You can have 10 bucks to 10 million bucks and if you got a crew, imagination and a lot of people willing to turn in some work next to nothing, you going to have a feature. But you can't get beyond how expensive marketing the movie is, it's so crushing.","And the podcasting - I swear to you - on its worst day, the podcasts are better than our best films. Because they're more imaginative, and there's no artifice, and it's far more real.","The older you get, the more you realize you cannot win on the Internet.","Other filmmakers make their movies and put them out and that's that. For me, for some odd reason, it goes deeper than that.","And George Carlin was a guy that the more he aged the younger he seemed.","Generally, I wake up, honestly it's creepy, but I wake up around 4:20.","People wanted more advice. So I finally thought I could totally put this advice into a book.","From now on, any flick I'm ever involved with, I conduct critics screenings thusly: 'You wanna see it early to review it? Fine: pay like you would if you saw it next week.'","I just love movies, so suddenly, you're political about movies, and that's dark. It's just not fun when something you love becomes calculated.","You know, comics and movies, even if you take a comic and turn it into a movie, we can't all be Joss Whedon.","So I know how I watch movies which is on my laptop, man. And that's how I suspect a lot of people do it.","In anything I've ever written, all the characters sound like me, which I don't think is a bad thing. It makes sense. But I had always admired filmmakers who made movies that didn't sound like them at all.","I think the advent of the Internet gave us all a big boost, because by the time the Internet became mainstream and you could get it in your home, a lot of us were used to dealing in fan culture, writing to magazines or anything at the back of comic books.","I saw Richard Linklater's film 'Slacker' for my twenty-first birthday. That was the moment when it all seemed possible. This guy gave me hope.","When you're an artist, all you're trying to do is self-express.","The first few films I made didn't look good at all, and I wasn't trying to make them look good. People dig 'em because they like the content.","I feel like if you're in Jersey, you have to be a Jersey Devils fan. Anybody born within the confines of the border of the state of New Jersey, I feel, should be a Jersey Devils fan.","If you grow up fat, you have to try harder.","I liked hockey, and I still like hockey.","I say what other people won't.","If there was no Internet, my career would have ended in 1995.","Oh, I'm online all the time now. I'm not an outdoorsy type."],"Kevin Sorbo":["Christianity takes this beating that I really don't understand and yet you can't say anything negative about the Muslims because that's horrible, you can't say anything negative about other faiths.","I've always been a religious guy, but not overly religious. I've always believed in God and Jesus. I pray.","It doesn't matter how successful you are in this business, it's tough to get through the next door.","The funny thing about television is that once you start to do it you never get time to watch it.","This is our lance. See, you're making me laugh about this now, because there have been a few jokes on the set about what they actually look like. But, see, I personally think they'd be a great toy. So... just batteries aren't included.","I'm definitely more understanding of people who have disabilities and who are suffering.","Well, anything can happen and it happened to me. I learned everybody has a story.","If you ever watched 'Hercules,' you can see that it was made in a comical way for the most part. I remember getting lots of letters from kids around the world saying that the show helped them curb their temper and not look for trouble and just walk away from it because that was the stronger thing to do.","Hollywood likes to put out their own message out a lot of times, and that message isn't the best one for everyone.","If you keep saying two plus two equals five over and over again, then that is what people are going to think. Maybe it does equal five if we keep changing the definition of what's normal and what's right and what's wrong."],"Kevin Spacey":["As long as we, in the United States, continue to insist that our politicians have to spend all of their time raising millions of dollars for television ads, it will be corrupt. If we leave it up to the politicians to clean up lobbying and finance reform, nothing is going to change.","I'm used to people thinking I'm nuts. And you know what? I kind of love it.","Sometimes it's the crazy people who turn out to be not so crazy.","No one's personal life is in the public interest. It's gossip, bottom line. End of story.","If you're lucky enough to do well, it's your responsibility to send the elevator back down.","We're all victims of our own hubris at times.","I find it sad that by not talking about who I sleep with, that makes me mysterious. There was a time when I would have been called a gentleman.","There are good people in the lobbying industry. Lobbyists can serve a very useful purpose.","Clearly the success of the Netflix model, releasing the entire season of 'House of Cards' at once, proved one thing: The audience wants the control. They want the freedom. If they want to binge as they've been doing on 'House of Cards' and lots of other shows, we should let them binge.","Maybe there are people who are gamers who haven't seen movies I have made, or the movies I have made have made no impression on them at all.","Life's all about perceptions.","I'm aware that, from the outside, this looks like I've got quite an ego.","I've been on sets where things weren't relaxed because someone was creating tension for no reason.","You have to always be ready, always be alive, and always be willing to move in a new direction.","Exposure to the arts and culture is enormously valuable.","If you're not concerned about maintaining an image, you can pursue roads that another actor might not take.","I was not a studious kid, and I struggled to find things that would command my attention and engage my ideas and energies.","I have always believed that the risk takers are eventually rewarded.","If you haven't turned rebel by twenty you've got no heart; if you haven't turned establishment by thirty you've got no brains!","I became a bit of a jerk. A kind of a nasty jerk.","I went through a period of great rebellion within my family, when I was about 9 or 10. I was mad, I had no focus, had no real interest in anything, and so I started to do things that were just rebellious and stupid.","It's always the big question in our lives if you have a lot of success. What do you do with it? Buy more houses, buy more cars, buy more stuff, be wealthy and distant and unengaged? Or do you take all that good fortune that has come towards you and spread the love, do something with it?","I accept the fact that some things don't go the way you hope.","I am now a commander of the British Empire.","One can never take the cynicism one comes across in life too seriously.","As a producer or financier, you are going to go where you get the best bang for your buck.","No matter how good you might be in a movie, you'll never be any better. But in a play, I can be better next Tuesday. That's the thrill of it.","I actually have a number of lovely watches from the International Watch Company.","Am I now supposed to go on Oprah and cry and tell you my deepest, darkest secrets because you want to know?","I would love to do much more singing; it's just one of those things where I can't quite describe what it feels like when you're standing in front of a forty piece orchestra, and there's nothing between you and an audience but a microphone. It's like strapping yourself to a locomotive, and I love it.","I don't watch rugby.","I feel it's a responsibility for anyone who breaks through a certain ceiling... to send the elevator back down and give others a helpful lift.","Give people what they want, when they want it, in the form they want it in, at a reasonable price, and they'll more likely pay for it rather than steal it. Well, some will still steal it, but I think we can take a bite out of piracy.","If you're watching a film on your television, is it no longer a film because you're not watching it in a theatre? If you watch a TV show on your iPad, is it no longer a TV show? The device and the length are irrelevant; the labels are useless, except perhaps to agents and managers and lawyers, who use these labels to conduct business deals.","The relationship with the cast has everything to do with how a performance develops, and in a sense that while you're discovering a play in the course of rehearsal with the director, you're also discovering it with your fellow actors. We're all in it together.","I was on a couple of scholarships. I had a job in the school administrative office. I had a job as a hat-check boy in a restaurant. I had another job as an assistant to a casting director. It took a lot to get myself enough money to put myself through Juilliard.","The Old Vic has always been first and foremost an actors' theatre, a home for great talent and memorable performances.","The fact is that HBO is doing the kind of films and the kind of stories that the movie industry used to do. You look at a lot of the specialty sections of studios that have gone under... and there's no doubt in my mind why filmmakers and screenwriters and actors are ending up at a place like HBO. They do it better than anybody.","Where the gaming world is going - and certainly Activision proved it by hiring me - is being willing to push and bend and move in a new direction of actually capturing the character and storytelling.","Audiences grew to like this duality of feeling, where you're both championing a character and you're revolted by them.","My mother was sarcastic and delightful and, trust me, quite remarkable.","I'm not someone who's led my life trying to get publicity; I'd rather do my work and go home.","If someone can watch an entire season of a TV series in one day, doesn't that show an incredible attention span?","And I certainly won't lay out areas of my life that I think are just private.","As the years have gone on, I find one of the dangers of watching dailies... is you fall in love with moments.","Directing a film was something I was yearning to do. I always wanted to see if I had the capacity to be a good storyteller.","It's a great thriller or mystery, but on another level it's a film about the fact that, if you only look at a person through one lens, or only believe what you're told, you can often miss the truth that is staring you in the face.","It's so easy for us to misperceive and see the things in others that we want to see. And, when we're wrong, and often we're dead wrong, we miss the truth.","My life will change, because I want it to change; and also because this is something I'm committed to doing and that I believe my life has been leading towards.","At the end of the day, people have to respect people's differences. I am different than some people would like me to be.","I am different than some people would like me to be. I just don't buy into that the personal can be political.","When you study, as I did, every theatrical beginning in this country, none of them have been greeted well. The Royal Shakespeare Company was a disaster, Peter Hall was a disaster, Richard Eyre was a disaster, Trevor Nunn was always a disaster.","I don't live a lie. You have to understand that people who choose not to discuss their personal lives are not living a lie. That is a presumption that people jump to.","To look in the eyes of audiences and see the kind of naughty glee that they got with being on the inside, the audience becomes your co-conspirators.","Being an actor sometimes requires that you ask yourself questions you'd rather not know the answers to.","After graduation, I was floundering in L.A., doing stand-up comedy and working in a shoe store in the Valley.","No one should ever feel sorry for me. I've been treated very well for the most part.","Success is like death. The more successful you become, the higher the houses in the hills get and the higher the fences get.","But I feel that I have a responsibility to help the film and I have relations with the studio and with those who put up the money so that I can tell a story that I believe in.","I liked it because it was such a dangerous script and showed just what human beings are capable of. Here was a movie in which Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, who always win in every movie they ever do, simply don't win. I felt that was outrageous for a commercial movie.","I mean we all played as kids. You play games, you take on different characters, you imitate; the fun and the love of play has never left me.","I open myself up every time I walk on screen and give you everything that I am. There are parts of me that are in every movie that I've done. That to me is what my job is.","I'm lucky if I find one movie a year that's worth doing, and when I do find one, it usually only takes 20-30 days to shoot.","I'm not out there trying to get press for myself nor am I trying to convince anybody that I'm living any kind of a life. I'm actually trying to convince people: I don't want you to know what I'm living, because it's none of your business.","I'm supposed to convince you, for two hours, that I'm somebody else. Now if you know everything about my life, if you think you've got me figured out and you think you know all my dark secrets, how am I ever going to convince you that I'm somebody else?","I've been trying to take this journey over the last four years of getting away from playing manipulative and villainous characters and playing characters that are affected by what happens to them as opposed to unaffected.","Over a spell of about three years, I played a series of roles that were, for me, all very different, but most of them came out within a six-month period. They all dealt with a kind of dark territory that in some cases had been mined before in movies.","Over the years, I've been trying to build a relationship with an audience. I've tried to maintain as much of a low profile as I could so that those characters would emerge and their relationship with audiences would be protected.","Secondarily, I think films that are driven by music also terrify studios.","Sometimes the person who is the most logical is the person whom we call insane.","The next day I was in my school's production of All My Sons. This was the performance where I realized something was happening between me and the audience that I hadn't recognized before.","For me, coming to work every day has turned out to be exactly what I hoped it would be.","For kids growing up now, there's no difference watching 'Avatar' on an iPad or watching YouTube on TV or watching 'Game of Thrones' on their computer. It's all content. It's just story.","Living in London has become incredible. I suppose it's easy to love where you live if you love what you're doing. But this is not just a visit: it's my home.","I don't care about my personal acting career anymore. I'm done with it. After 10 years of making movies and doing better than I ever could have imagined, I sort of had to ask myself: 'What am I supposed to do with all of this success that I have had?'","People have different reasons for the way they live their lives. You cannot put everyone's reasons in the same box.","It takes stamina to get up like an athlete every single night, seven to eight performances a week, 20 weeks in a row. And there are many young performers who only learn their craft in the two minute bits it takes to film a scene. You never learn the arc of storytelling, the arc of a character that way.","The stigma that used to exist many years ago, that actors from film don't do television, seems to have disappeared. That camera doesn't know it's a TV camera... or even a streaming camera. It's just a camera.","It's not easy to sustain a long career, and sometimes I don't even think about how long I've been doing it.","I've been intrigued by politics my whole life. And, yes, I am very close to the Clintons. I was a Hillary person until I was an Obama person. And she was a Hillary person, too, until she was an Obama one, evidently.","I am so leading the life that I want and wanted and dreamed of as a kid. I'm trying very hard not to abuse it or take advantage of it.","The less you know about me, the easier it is to convince you that I am that character on screen.","One of the tasks that any artistic director has is, you're trying to bring elements together that will work. The truth is that you could bring all the best talents in the world together and produce a big turkey.","I might have lived in England for the last several years, but I'm still an American citizen and I have not given up my right to privacy.","Film is very condensed.","Am I arrogant? I've been arrogant, sure; everybody's been arrogant.","I don't play villainy. I wouldn't even know how to play it.","I guess I've been training in the theater for as long as I can remember.","Essentially, your voice is an instrument; it's a muscle, and you have to treat it like a muscle, and so you have to work it.","If you go out eight times and play tennis eight times this week, yeah, it's the same rules, but it's a different game every time you're out on that court. You're working on a different part of your game every time you're out on that court; your partner's working on a different part of their game, and the act of being watched changes it.","Francis Underwood was entirely based on Richard III. When Michael Dobbs wrote 'House of Cards' in the original British series, Richard III is what he based the character on.","People think that direct address was invented by Ferris Bueller, but in fact, it wasn't. It was invented by Shakespeare.","My mother always, always, always thought that I was going to be famous. Thought that I was going to win Oscars. In fact, I believe I accepted the Oscar as a ketchup bottle many a time in front of my mother in the kitchen. 'I'd like to thank the Academy,' I said with a ketchup bottle.","When I was young, I learned very early on that I could make my mother laugh. And that was one of the greatest sounds I ever heard.","The audience, the place you're in, has everything to do with how your performance goes.","I don't categorize characters into one syllable. These are fully-rounded characters that I don't judge; I just play them.","I'm attracted to things that are challenging and fun and interesting, and it certainly seems that audiences enjoy them as well.","I think that there was a period of time - and I would reckon it was about 12 years - where I was just determined to see if I could build a career for myself.","It's interesting to play a politician who gets stuff done.","There's nothing like standing in a place and wanting nothing so much as to change but simply not being able to.","As an actor, you're always nervous as to what a director will do with something.","I'll tell you one thing. I've never heard a director saying that the dailies suck.","Bobby Darin was one of the first to take black musicians on the road with his band, and there were places that didn't want him to play, and he stood up to it.","I felt that I shouldn't be an actor who just makes movie after movie in a quest for prestige and money.","I couldn't imagine something asking as much of me as 'House Of Cards.' It's a great warm-up for coming back to the screen.","I've never done a movie that's shot more than 40 days because I just don't do those kinds of films.","Both 'Consenting Adults' and 'Glengarry Glen Ross' revolve around the economic stresses of the '90s. They are about what people do when they're pushed against that wall, and how they're manipulated. They are both morality tales, though in very different genres.","Clarence Darrow was a unique and courageous man. Several of my favourite actors have played Darrow... Henry Fonda, Orson Welles and Spencer Tracy.","You can almost hear people saying, 'We're going to make a movie about an election' and 'We're going to make a movie about a lobbyist.' You can hear the yawning start across the nation.","In film, movies' schedules are based on three things: actors' availabilities, when are sets being built, when you can rent the place you're going to film in.","I'm not revolted by Washington.","There are times when you do a play when you are living in the character over a two-and-a-half-hour period or longer, and you come to the end of the night, and you can feel like you were hit by a truck.","I'm able to hang up the character with the costume at the end of the movie.","The only real experiences I've had with therapists were the ones who were working with me and my family when my mother was ill.","I certainly identify with the role of mentor and, to some degree, maybe teacher. I do a lot of work with kids at the Old Vic.","I've always found it strange that a director can hire any designer he wants from any country. But if he hires a foreign actor, it's like he's stolen the crown jewels and run across the river with them.","I always thought that, in a way, you want your Superman to be a total unknown.","I'm not going to make general comments about the British press.","Whether that's positive or not, people are talking about the Old Vic Theater again with passion and commitment and controversy and debate.","What I like about Britain is that I can live a normal life here.","People don't tend to hassle me because when I've got a hat on, I look like a banker. I'm just a plain guy.","Games are advancing in terms of storytelling and trying to create a character, and it's a brand new audience for me.","I've taken the experiences that I've had in the theatre and applied them to film and television and now games.","I have never played a game in my life.","If you ignore the murdering and the conniving, Francis Underwood is an effective politician.","People say, 'If you open a movie online at the same time as in movie theatres, no one is going to go to the movies.' That's just not true. People love to go out and have a shared experience; they always will.","Why is 'Game of Thrones' the most pirated show in the history of TV? Because people can't get it fast enough, that's why.","Kids aren't growing up with a sense of television as the aspirational place for their ideas.","Working in film tends to isolate actors - it's your close-up; it's all about you.","When I look around at Broadway and the West End, theatre is becoming an exclusive club.","If we don't reach out to make theatre affordable to the young generation, we will lose them all.","Cable TV has become where the best actors, writers and directors have gone to work because they are allowed to do character-driven stories.","If you look back through history in the United States, there have been very few landslide elections. Half the country always voted for someone else.","Partisan rancour and party politics and ideology have got in the way of compromise - and compromise is the only thing that has ever made politics successful.","What I've certainly learned is that whenever I've said anything about real politics, I've come under attack. So it's best simply to play politics on television.","People have really long attention spans, and they love complicated plots. TV series are giving the audience what they want.","The more shows that are produced, the more writers are hired, producers are hired, actors are hired, directors are hired, it means the more people will get employed. It's better for the economy. It's a fantastic thing.","I was terrible in my first play. After that experience, I had to face that I wasn't good enough to play with the big boys. I had to go away and learn, so I worked in regional theater for three years. I even understudied at the Kennedy Center.","It's the details and the human element that makes 'Recount' entertaining. Even though we know how the election ends, it plays like a thriller. It's also funny.","The audience wants control. They want freedom.","For years, particularly with the advent of the Internet, people have been griping about lessening attention spans.","When the story is good enough, people can watch something three times the length of an opera.","There are a lot of people out there who offer roles to actors because they'll elevate their movie to a place the movie would never reach.","I believe this: If an actor wants a role or wants to work with somebody, then you do everything within reason to try to get that role. If they want you to audition, you audition. If they want you to screen-test, you screen-test. If they want you to come and tap-dance in their hallway, you tap-dance in their hallway.","We're going to see a lot of companies that have been portals of entertainment become producers.","'The 24 Hour Plays' is a quite brilliant, exhilarating event for everyone concerned.","While data can only tell you what has happened in the past, it can in some ways give you a sense of what might be of interest to an audience in the future.","I never wanted to go to the Old Vic and not have it survive long after I was gone. It's not about me; it's about that theater. And the more that it's able to grow and do everything it should do without me, then I've done my job.","I'm not a writer, and I don't want there to be any mistake about that.","My admiration for 'Mary Tyler Moore' is very, very big because they went out on top.","I think people love it when anybody acts bad; it's not particular to me.","When you're just able to distill it down to the idea and the feeling that a character is experiencing in a scene, it can become very, very razor sharp and really clean and really efficient and simple. And sometimes it takes twenty-five years to learn how to be simple.","Anytime someone can beat the acting out of someone else, I think it's a wonderful thing.","I don't even think in terms of ambition.","I can imagine there is going to come a time when someone will do 13 hours of a story without breaks.","I believe if you go to a movie theatre, and you see something you think is incredible, if you walk out of the theatre and there was a bin in the lobby of DVDs of the film you just watched, you would buy four of them - one for you and three for your friends.","If you wanna compete, you've got to get into the original content game.","Why not sit around a Beverly Hills pool collecting residual cheques? That is not the kind of life I want.","There does seem to be in the U.S. now an ideology and an entrenchment that has stopped people doing what they are hired to do, which is govern rather than run for office the whole time.","I have wanted to have children. I do want to have children.","I love doing impressions.","What's my favourite book? It changes all the time.","I remember meeting the likes of Johnny Carson and Jimmy Stewart for the first time and being completely starstruck.","London is a very energising place to be.","Fundamentally, I like to accomplish things.","I terribly miss - we all miss, I think - somebody like the great producer Irving Thalberg. He had a foot in both camps: He understood us creative people. And he understood the money people.","I want to do better. I want to produce better stories. I want to do better plays.","Storytelling helps us understand each other, translate the issues of our times, and the tools of theater and film can be powerful in helping young people to develop communication/collaboration skills, let alone improving their own confidence.","While the sciences are hugely important, let us not leave behind a child's imagination.","It's a really wonderful thing to focus your life on something other than your own personal career and ambition.","I think it is just a function of the fact that I moved around so much as a child that I learnt early on to make every place my home.","I have long been a supporter of The Prince's Trust, and so when American Express asked me to launch 'Amex Be Inspired' and help young people build their confidence and fulfil their potential, I was delighted to get involved.","I'm always taken aback by things that are successful that I think are just crap, and then I'm completely surprised when things I do end up being successful because you walk into things and you never know... It's just really remarkable.","If there is one thing I object to, it's actors talking about how tough their jobs are.","I like being able to go to a local pub and have great food and particularly love pubs that welcome my dogs.","It's extremely dangerous to compare anyone else to Shakespeare.","What hasn't surprised me is that audiences, as we found starting with box sets, want control, to decide how they watch it. Appointment viewing is slowly being put slightly behind.","A British director directed 'American Beauty,' an important film about American life, and it didn't matter. What only mattered was everyone's sensibility.","You just play what a writer writes, in terms of what a character chooses to do and how a character chooses to deal with their various relationships.","Whether it's 'Veep' or 'Homeland' or 'The West Wing' - which is a more idealised version of democracy - people are fascinated by politics.","There's no doubt that some of the greatest films ever made have come from the theater. It's all a matter of finding a way to make the theater experience watchable on film.","The process of doing a play is an organic one, and the process of doing a film is totally inorganic.","Meeting the person you are going to be playing is very unique.","Over the years, I've spent a lot of time in Washington. It's a great theater town.","I have to remember if I'm at some charitable event where kids are... I try to remember don't swear in front of the kids!","Have we become so celebrity-obsessed that there is no longer a difference between a character and an actor? I hope not.","People sometimes have to be reminded, I'm not Frank Underwood. I'm an actor named Kevin Spacey.","I think that what is truly unfortunate is when an entire party makes a decision that they're going to block every single thing that a president wants to accomplish. It's very - it's very hard to get anything done in those circumstances.","President Obama will go down as having passed some of the most historic bills in the history of this country.","Some politicians that I've seen have been brilliant with the public. They almost speak with the skill of an actor.","There are ways in which you can make sure that even if people come to the theatre because they know an actor or actress, by the end, they've forgotten that, and they leave going, 'Wow - what an amazing play.'","You learn every single day when you're running a company. You learn as you go.","Edward Norton and I have known each other awhile. I just think he's the real deal, supremely talented and smart. He's got a great sense of humor.","I cotton to the idea that people are much closer to being flawed; they have problems and don't always make the right choices.","I write a lot about my experiences and the people I meet. I've got a lot of material. But a book about me? It seems sort of odd."],"Kevin Sussman":["Everybody should leave their country at some point and visit others because you realize we're all people who need a chance to know about each other. That would benefit everyone.","I had done enough TV stuff before 'The Big Bang Theory.' I had done enough to sort of appreciate how awesome everybody is on 'The Big Bang Theory,' how nice and cool everybody is.","I used to actually work in a comic book stores in New York."],"Kevin Systrom":["Do what you love, and do it well - that's much more meaningful than any metric.","Every photo you take communicates something about a moment in time - a brief slice of time of where you were, who you were with, and what you were doing.","It helps to see the world through a different lens, and that's what we wanted to do with Instagram. We wanted to give everyone the same feeling of discovering the world around you through a different lens.","Instagram was created because there was no single place dedicated to giving your mobile photos a place to live and to be seen.","I've always been into taking my photos, cropping them square, putting them through a filter in Photoshop.","Back in the day, I actually studied photography in Florence for a few months, and my photography teacher took away my digital camera and said, 'No, use this - it's analog and it's square.' It was a Holga camera, a very cheap $3 or $4 plastic camera. And that's what inspired 'Instagram'.","If you've got an idea, start today. There's no better time than now to get going. That doesn't mean quit your job and jump into your idea 100% from day one, but there's always small progress that can be made to start the movement.","In the past, people have looked at photos as a record of memory. The focus has been on the past tense. With Instagram, the focus is on the present tense.","Products can introduce more complexity over time, but as far as launching and introducing a new product into the market, it's a marketing problem. You have to explain everything you do, and people have to understand it, within seconds.","The printing press did something really big for the world when everyone could get books in their hands and read.","The way people communicate is changing, and no one knows this better than teens. We are using images to talk to each other, to communicate what we're doing, what we're thinking, and to tell stories.","Imagine the power of surfacing what's happening in the world through images, and potentially other types of media in the future, to each and every person who holds a mobile phone.","Every startup should address a real and demonstrated need in the world - if you build a solution to a problem lots of people have, it's so easy to sell your product to the world.","The major reason why Instagram works is that you can follow anyone out there and start following their photos immediately.","Great products sell themselves.","I like to say that the one thing that all people who succeed in changing the world have in common is that they at least tried.","Instagram is a media company. I think we're about visual media.","People don't work in a dotcom because they have to. There are many professions that don't require that sort of time. But people sign up because they want to make world-changing differences, to build something that affects millions of people.","On average, people miss about 70 percent of the posts in their 'Instagram' feed. What this is about is making sure that the 30 percent you see is the best 30 percent possible.","I've always had a passion for technology, photography, startups, and connecting people. Bringing those aspects together made me successful.","I own a Canon 20D, though I don't remember the last time I used it. Ever since the iPhone 4, I've been completely absorbed in taking photos from my mobile phone.","Most photo apps before asked something of the users. They said, 'You produce, act, and perform.' 'Instagram' said, 'Let us take care of the secret sauce.'","You can build a filter app get people really excited, but the way to keep them is to provide long-term value. Long-term value is, in fact, being its own network.","When you're introducing a mobile app, you look around and say, 'We could be doing 15 different things, but how do we communicate to someone why they would want to download and even sign up for this thing?'","Good companies are always fundraising. Whether you're meeting people or considering firms, you're always fundraising.","It's funny: I was a photographer before I was a programmer.","I actually think some of my best moments in life have been while I was with people from Instagram - whether it's super late nights getting a release out or being able to travel to places I'd never visited and meeting some of the most interesting people I've ever met.","I believe photos is one of the underlying things in every social network that becomes successful.","People interact with their phones very differently than they do with their PCs, and I think that when you design from the ground up with mobile in mind, you create a very different product than going the other way.","I grew up as a photo nut. Every Christmas I would get a new camera. It's a huge part of my life.","Working at a startup to make a lot of money was never a thing, and that's why I decided to just finish up school. That was way more important for me.","When people say that college isn't worthwhile and paying all this money isn't worthwhile, I really disagree. I think those experiences and those classes that may not necessarily seem applicable in the moment end up coming back to you time and time again.","I think not focusing on money makes you sane because in the long run it can probably drive you crazy.","I'm always in awe of people who are artists in their fields - people who understand that simply by taking ideas and translating them into reality, they've created value in the world.","I don't think you should ever start a business and move in a direction where you can't see it becoming a business.","There are fun parts of running a startup and not so fun parts, and Facebook handles the not so fun parts, like infrastructure, spam, sales. The real questions are, how big can 'Instagram' get? Is it 400 million, or bigger? Can it be a viable business if it is that big? These are at the top of the list for everyone in Silicon Valley.","Calling 'Instagram' a photo-sharing app is like calling a newspaper a letter-sharing book, or a Mozart grand era symphony a series of notes. 'Instagram' is less about the medium and more about the network.","I care deeply about craft: the quality of how something is made and the experience it enables.","Brands, musicians, and public figures were among the first to embrace video on 'Instagram', and we've been impressed with how brands have extended their reach with video ads.","Whether it's an ad or organic content, video provides a new creative dimension for storytelling on 'Instagram'. Video lets people convey the power and beauty in a moment through sight, sound, and motion.","It is cool to see that the fashion world has really taken to 'Instagram,' but, again, it is one of the many examples of many communities, whether you are a chef, a skateboarder, a surfer, a skier.","There are a lot more companies with a lot younger people. It is just like 23-year-olds are starting companies, and they are scaling really quickly.","Photos were seen as the most private type of content, and 'Instagram' really flipped that on its head and said photos can be really public.","If it's one thing we do really well as a company, it's that we take big change slowly and deliberately and bring the community along with us.","Facebook's campus has a lot of creative spaces: an analogue print shop, a candy store. It's a dynamic place and one of the best environments I've been in, period.","'Instagram' is great if you want to share photos, but you're not that technical. Or, if you're not interested in sharing publicly, 'Instagram' becomes a place where you can not only consume photos and videos from musicians, or whoever, but send them directly to your friends.","'Instagram' can engage generations of people that may not be on Facebook yet. I think that's true with 'WhatsApp,' and I think that will be true with things like Oculus.","I can't imagine that companies are uninteresting if they don't have a billion users. But I do believe, to have mass scale, you have to be in the many-hundreds-of-millions-of-users range, and there are not that many companies that get there.","There are billions of dollars spent every year on traditional media. The majority of people are spending more time every day on the Internet, especially on mobile. You're starting to see a shift of that spend go to mobile, especially to things like 'Instagram'.","A lot of the earliest 'Instagram' celebrities took really beautiful photos. But you're starting to see a change where it's not about beauty; it's about the story that you tell.","I run a business and go all over the world doing things for that business, things that are fairly orthogonal. But my job is to run my company, not to be the best Instagrammer. I'll let other people be awesome at it.","As a kid, creation was something that I always loved. Creating worlds for video games, creating businesses that didn't make any money, selling lemonade, etcetera. In my fourth grade classroom, I even instituted a government structure because I was really interested in people having positions and there being law.","'Instagram' doesn't exist in a vacuum. We're not a bunch of siloed individuals. It's a bunch of people coming together on topics, fashion, you know, youthful teens, creatives, photographers, foodies, everyone coming together and building a community around the things they love, communicating visually.","One of the earliest requested features was to do premium filters where a brand could sponsor a filter. It's just not in our wheelhouse. It doesn't feel 'Instagram'-my in the way that the high-quality brand ads do.","When you open up 'Instagram,' you need to know that you're seeing the real Tony Hawk, the real Taylor Swift, the real Burberry.","'Instagram' Direct is a really interesting feature because it's grown significantly since we launched it. People continue to use it to communicate more privately.","There's a natural set of constraints with mobile phones that force you to be a better photographer by acknowledging and observing the world around you.","Videos are a very difficult medium to be good at and also a difficult medium to consume quickly.","I try to list the top three things to get done every day, and I'll be lucky if I hit all three, but it's amazing what that does to keep you on track.","Someone once described entrepreneurship to me as a series of happy accidents.","Just so everyone knows, we're not a photo-sharing company. I don't see photos on 'Instagram' as art. They're much more about communication.","Really, we're just taking people and shifting them from taking photos anyway to taking them on 'Instagram'.","A platform is the base from which something big happens. In our case, we're an entertainment platform in the sense that there are people signing up like MTV, Burberry, folks like Taylor Swift and Justin Bieber. And why? Because it's their channel to control their entertainment to their fans.","'Instagram' is definitely becoming a new entertainment source for people day after day.","All of us in social media and regular media, we're all competing for the same thing, which is this gap between something happening in the world and you knowing about it.","People are hungry for what's happening right now in the world.","If you're a journalist, and you want to see live photos happening at any location in our system, you can simply type in the location, and up comes the page.","'Instagram' reached 13 million users in just 13 months.","I'm a huge fan of what 'Hipstamatic' is doing and all they've accomplished.","Our goal is to allow people to use whatever app they want to get photos into 'Instagram'.","The best companies in the world have all had predecessors. 'YouTube' was a dating site. You always have to evolve into something else.","Mike Krieger and I started talking, and he decided he liked the idea of helping start the company. Once he joined, we took a step back and looked at the product as it stood.","It turns out that no undergrad class prepares you to start a startup - you learn most of it as you do it.","Traditional businesses can say, 'We're going to sell widgets to people, and it will make X amount of profit.' But new business models are hard.","A photo app is a utility. It's like comparing 'Twitter' to Microsoft Word. If you want to be an author, you're not always going to constrain yourself to 140 characters.","'Instagram' is an app that only took 8 weeks to build and ship but was a product of over a year of work.","There are a lot of apps that are fun to use - they're utility apps; they're fine. But there are a fraction of apps that are in the cream of the crop. You just need to be in the cream of the crop to get noticed.","'Instagram' is a media company. I think we're about visual media. I explain ourselves as a disruptive entertainment platform that enables communication through visual media. I don't think it's just photos.","I don't foresee a future where people don't have some sort of phone that's like a computer. I don't foresee a future where those phones don't have cameras in them. That spells a future where smartphones are the status quo. You have to ask yourself how you allow people to communicate what's in their lives.","Our goal is really to make sure that 'Instagram', whether you're a celebrity or not, is a safe place and that the content that gets posted is something that's appropriate for teens and also for adults.","It's wonderful when you pair entrepreneurs together because they can share experiences and in some ways push each other to build better products going forward.","Chobani did a really wonderful yogurt campaign on 'Instagram' to shift perceptions away from the fact that they were just yogurt. And they had a 7-point incremental lift on shifting that perception through a brand advertisement on Instagram.","I think it's hard to compare 'Twitter' and 'Instagram'. Twitter has a more mature business.","I like to compare 'Instagram' to the Library of Congress.","If you focus on producing a great experience for anyone, that's how you get big.","I think Instagram at its best is where you feel like you're getting the most authentic version of the person on the other side of the camera. Someone who does this wonderfully well is Lena Dunham.","I do believe that Instagram has put a stake in the ground and we're growing more quickly than anyone. Is there something in there we could do to make it a multi-billion dollar business? I think we can figure out something along the way.","Mobile has created a totally different dynamic for discovering apps. You're sitting in a bar, and your friend is taking some pictures, and then you ask what app they're using."],"Kevin Warsh":["I'm not afraid of having big banks.","Tennis was more than a passing interest, but I found my ability didn't measure up to these West Coast kids who had played 12 months a year and taken it much more seriously than I.","I was quite convinced that I didn't want to be a lawyer. But I felt that law school would be a useful way to understand public policy and to understand business in this environment."],"Kevin Weisman":["I would marry TiVo if President Bush would allow it.","I like the first-person games, but I like the two-person element in terms of playing basketball games with my friends. That's a good time; we have tournaments and things.","I like technology. I mean, I have surround at home so I can listen to the Lakers."],"Kevin Whately":["Walking is my main method of relaxation. I don't go over my lines or try to solve the world's problems, I just enjoy the scenery and the wildlife.","You just suddenly think that there's something quite childish about acting. Basically, it's pretending, isn't it? It's good fun and I enjoy it, but it's a funny way of making a living, particularly when you make a very good wage, as I've been fortunate enough to do.","With your own children, you love them immediately - and with grandchildren, it's exactly the same.","Being in Oxford can be a bit like being on holiday - there's plenty of time spent in the pub.","Dementia is often regarded as an embarrassing condition that should be hushed up and not spoken about. But I feel passionately that more needs to be done to raise awareness, which is why I became an ambassador for the Alzheimer's Society.","The more telly you do, the more it feels like a factory.","Being a grandparent is whole new phase in your life.","I suppose it's a sentimental thing, but I wouldn't want to do more 'Lewis' than we did 'Morse' because I do still think of it as an offshoot.","Put me on telly, and I think I have a relaxation on camera that makes an audience relax, too. It's not a conscious thing. Cameras don't bother me, whereas other people try to perform to them.","I wish people would take more care of the countryside.","I never have liked detective dramas. I try to watch all of them to see what's going on, but I don't like them.","My mum Mary was always a bright, confident and fiercely independent lady.","You can't converse with Alzheimer's sufferers in the way you do with others; the dialogue tends to go round in circles.","I wanted to be a stage actor but I got stuck on television. It took a couple of years to get used to.","People think I'm thick because of the characters I play. I think I'm brighter than the characters. Well, I hope I am.","I'm fascinated by politicians, because I suspect the huge majority of them go into it full of ideas and for the best possible reasons but end up being hijacked.","I'm not interested in more money for the sake of it.","I've been going to Bamburgh for holidays since I was a child.","From the time you are a tiny baby, a parent's love is usually unconditional. Whatever you do, your parents think you are the tops, but when their memory goes, you stop recouping the love you've put in.","With something like cancer, there is a feeling that you can fight it in some way or control your response to it, but with dementia there is the fear of losing control of your mind and your life.","Before my mother's diagnosis with Alzheimer's, I had heard of the disease, but hadn't known anyone who had suffered from it.","With all the lines I have to learn for TV scripts, I don't think I have any problems with forgetfulness - that's brain exercise enough for me.","My family have been around Northumberland for five generations.","I'm very good at being out of work.","I'm not interested in more money for the sake of it. You're aware that if you're nicking all the budget, somebody else is getting threepence ha'penny, or the production values aren't going to be so high.","It always staggers me when series don't use their sidekicks.","I'm not very relaxed; I always need to be doing something.","I still remember going to a smart restaurant in Los Angeles, and the maitre d' knew my name and showed me straight to a table even though we hadn't booked. I get stopped for autographs by people from Sweden on the tops of mountains.","Oxford has a slightly mythical rep, particularly for people who haven't been there.","I'm the captain of the Variety Club over in England, and so I'm playing golf for them once a week but doing odd bits.","You're very aware in the theater by the response you get, but not so much on television, obviously.","People are very appreciative, and I'm always thrilled at how long the 'Morse' films have lasted. They seem to have an afterlife that goes on and on for decades, which is touching.","I only really like to watch things like 'Time Team.' I'd rather be out walking the dog. It's all reality TV, which, as an actor, I detest.","I hate anything with 'celebrity' in the title, where people are playing to the cameras all the time.","I'm not particularly fond of the past, but I do ramble on about it quite a bit.","I am lucky in that I have never been depressed in my life, but this is the one thing which has really affected me: the loss of my mother as I knew her.","You get pigeonholed. Some people are film stars, and some are theatre stars who do one-off telly. Somehow, I get into long-running series.","When I get some time off, I like to go back to my roots in the North East. My family have been around Northumberland for five generations.","While I'm driving north, I'm already thinking about kippers - it's worth the journey just to have kippers for breakfast on Saturday.","When I have time, I really enjoy cooking.","I catch an old 'Morse' on ITV3. I've never thought I looked particularly like my son. He's taller than me and blond. But when I see Lewis walk into a room with John Thaw, it's like my son has just come onto the screen. That's very strange indeed!","I initially thought 'Lewis' was a terrible idea. The character had very much been Morse's work donkey and sounding board. But I was persuaded to do it, thinking if it was a flop, at least ITV would stop asking me. But the pilot took off, so we got back on this moving train, and we've never looked back.","Mum had regular mental tests with her specialist, but because of her academic background, she became brilliant at manipulating them.","Let's just say I've never relied on my looks to make a living.","You can see some very great theatre actors who don't work at all well on screen. They're trying too hard at it.","When you get to the end of a TV series, you feel totally out of sorts as an actor. You feel unfit; your voice box has collapsed on you because you've spent all day muttering into a microphone that's two inches from your head, and you feel desperate to spread your wings and do a bit of real thesping.","In TV, you just have to decide the night before exactly how you're going to say it and stick with that. You can't kick it around; you haven't got time.","I don't like two-dimensional characters who are obviously villains from the moment they walk on stage.","I feel very at home in woodlands and could easily live there. I should have been one of Robin Hood's men.","McQueen is an astonishing film maker. He uses really unusual shots and builds incredible dramatic tension.","Oxford is a funny place, as it is a mixture of town and gown. You have the students at the main university and at Oxford Brookes, but there is also a big working-class community.","When I came down south, I went to one of the early Wigan Challenge Cup victories at Wembley, and I was totally hooked from then.","I loved Martin Offiah, Andy Farrell and Shaun Edwards in that Wigan team, and they are still heroes today. They were outstanding players and great to watch.","I love taking the boat to the Farne Islands, a few miles offshore. It has a National Trust bird sanctuary with seals and every sort of seabird you can imagine.","The real reason I love Bamburgh is that it's the only place in the world where I ever truly relax.","I read the papers like everybody else, so I don't complain about what they print.","I know actors who court personal publicity because they believe no publicity is bad publicity.","I honestly don't think I sought fame. It wasn't something I courted or wanted, particularly.","I don't see why it gives people the right to know about my private life if I don't want to talk about it."],"Kevin Williamson":["It's about a young girl who will stop at nothing to be the valedictorian of her class. It's very dark and very wicked, but it's got a great part for a kid, and a great part for an older woman.","Typically in horror films the character just services the plot, and you really are just going from 'point a' to 'point b,' just so that you can end up at 'point c.' They are just sort of stick characters. That's just not interesting to me.","What I loved about 'Summer' was that they were these four bright kids with a wonderful future. In a way, she was the one with the brains, and then you have the beauty queen and the jock and the introvert.","And that's what I liked about it, because they are, in the beginning, your little beautiful stock figures, who then make a decision to preserve their futures, but the decision they make isn't completely right, and it destroys their futures.","That's the thing about the script, is that how these people were affected by their decision, and how it could ultimately kill them, and I mean literally.","It's a morality film, and it poses the question 'What would you do?' I took it very seriously, just as the director did in terms of atmosphere and lighting, and I was just trying to help that vision along.","I don't want to give too much of it away, because I haven't cleared it with Bob, but the treatment is twenty years, and she, in an effort to protect herself faked her death and did a series of things regarding Dr. Loomis, who has died, because Michael Myers was after her.","Hey, I'm happy someone is hiring me. It could be all over. I'm so lucky to have a job.","I'm so lucky that 'The Vampire Diaries' happened. I'm so lucky that Warner Bros. pays me money. You have no idea. I should be on a fishing boat with my dad.","I like emotional horror. I don't like horror movies. I hate them. But, if you can make emotional horror movies, I'm in. If I can care and root for the main character, then I'm in."],"Kevin Wilson":["Short stories, for me, it's like you step inside this brand new car and you drive it and you drive it into a tree and you walk away from it.","I grew up reading not-serious literature, like comic books and pulp novels, so my instinct is to amuse the reader and entertain.","Children do have the potential to kill art. But now I think they kill the bad art. At least that is what my son has done for me.","I have a kind of unhealthy obsession with movies.","I grew up not reading fiction; I watched movies and read comic books, and one of the ways I taught myself to think about narrative was through film.","I don't know if it's good or bad, but when I first started writing I imitated the narrative thrust of a movie. And as I worked, I learned what you can do in fiction that you can't do in movies, and vice-versa.","My parents were distrustful of the outside world. They didn't think much good came out of it... The outside world was this strange place that was not so much dangerous as not as interesting as what went on in the house."],"Kevin Yoder":["What we need is more money back in the hands of Americans of any economic standing and so raising taxes right now doesn't make sense.","Raising taxes doesn't create jobs, and this is a common sense thing. Washington doesn't get it. They believe if they take more money and send it to Washington, D.C. somehow they create wealth. It doesn't work.","In the current law we're seeing Social Security dwindle. And so what we're saying is if we're going to reduce taxes we just want to make sure that there are things within the law that pay for it.","There's an issue with the Medicare doctor reimbursement rates where at the end of the year every doctor that folks in this country use that provide Medicare services is going to get a 30 percent salary cut.","To go from chairman of the House Appropriations Committee in the Kansas Legislature to one of 50 on the Appropriations Committee and one of 435 in the whole House, it is more difficult to directly impact policy here.","Certainly in the Capitol you do get moments were you sort of take a deep breath and think of all the historic figures who have been in that building, like Abraham Lincoln, who have stood right in those same rooms to make the landmark decisions.","I love the Capitol rotunda. It's just so big and so grand, and I love being in the Capitol at night when it's empty, and you can go stand in the Capitol rotunda and bask in the silence of history. You can sort of imagine all of the things that have happened inside that Rotunda from presidents lying in state to other important events.","When you're in elected office, you always have to operate under the assumption that you're in a dog fight for re-election. It's when you don't prepare for a tough battle, when you're caught flat-footed, that you're vulnerable."],"Kevin Zegers":["I definitely learned to appreciate there is something about looking good. I think it's been sort of lost in the last 50 years, this idea of looking very nice and very put together.","I feel like Canadian movies should be as good or better than the competition because of the talent we have here.","I feel like Canadian movies should be as good or better than the competition because of the talent we have here. Someone like Ryan Gosling shouldn't have to come back here because it's a Canadian movie. He should want to come back because some of the best movies are being made here.","I'm a jeans and t-shirts kind of guy, but there have definitely been moments where I'm like, 'You know what? I need to upgrade a little bit.' I've tried to snazz things up as much as I can, with me being as lazy as I am.","I have always like doing accents; I find it much easier to get into character for me."],"Kevyn Aucoin":["Today I choose life. Every morning when I wake up I can choose joy, happiness, negativity, pain... To feel the freedom that comes from being able to continue to make mistakes and choices - today I choose to feel life, not to deny my humanity but embrace it.","Beauty is about perception, not about make-up. I think the beginning of all beauty is knowing and liking oneself. You can't put on make-up, or dress yourself, or do you hair with any sort of fun or joy if you're doing it from a position of correction.","It's our hearts and brains that we should exercise more often. You can put on all the makeup you want, but it won't make your soul pretty.","Life is too short to spend hoping that the perfectly arched eyebrow or hottest new lip shade will mask an ugly heart.","Perfection is boring. If a face doesn't have mistakes, it's nothing.","Today I see beauty everywhere I go, in every face I see, in every single soul.","I'm not saying that putting on makeup will change the world or even your life, but it can be a first step in learning things about yourself you may never have discovered otherwise. At worst, you could make a big mess and have a good laugh.","Fear is the most debilitating emotion in the world, and it can keep you from ever truly knowing yourself and others - its adverse effects can no longer be overlooked or underestimated. Fear breeds hatred, and hatred has the power to destroy everything in its path.","That's why I began doing makeup in the first place: I was hoping that through helping people see the beauty in themselves, I could try and find it in me.","I was absolutely lost in love and life when I did my drawings. Time stood still.","I'm going to insult a whole industry here, but it seems like TV is for people who can't do film. I'm not talking about actresses; I'm talking about lighting people. Lighting on TV is just so... it's sinful, it really is.","Beauty has a lot to do with character.","Yes, but everyone is beautiful to someone.","Kids threw rocks at me, told me I was ugly and left death threats in my locker.","Another thing that's pathetic is this rule that you have to look ugly to get respect as an actress. Jessica Lange had to make herself look really bad to prove that she had amazing talent.","I made a crash landing here on Earth on February 14, 1962, in the Shreveport Catholic Charities Home for un-wed mothers. The infamous Bonnie and Clyde lost their lives just miles from where I was born. Like outlaws ourselves, my birth mother and I were on the run from the day she found out I was part of her.","There are two types of people in the world: people who are passionate about things, and people who've had their passion punched, beaten, or whatever out of them.","I didn't know what gay was. There was no such thing when I was growing up. I knew I had crushes on boys, but I didn't think there was anything wrong with that until I started to hear about it from the other kids in school.","I spent much of my life hiding.","While traveling around the world, I've had the opportunity to work with every living beauty icon. I've learned to appreciate idiosyncrasy. The fact is, there is really no such thing as 'normal' - everybody's different, and that is the essence of their beauty.","Trying to conceal the fact that I was a gay, effeminate, hyperactive, adopted child with a serious lisp in southern Louisiana would have been like trying to hide Dolly Parton in a string bikini!","I'd rather have huge success and huge failures than travel in the middle of the road.","The faces I see in the modeling industry can get dull.","Growing up, my ideals were Barbra Streisand, Cher, and my mom.","I also have this incredible love for women.","I think the responsibility lies with the fashion world as a collective. We have to demand more variety.","I'm very passionate about what I do.","Soon I realized that if beauty equalled forgiveness, I was never going to be forgiven.","When I was growing up, the men in my life were abusive; women were the ones I ran to for comfort.","I don't use 'always do this,' 'never say that' and I never give advice because I'm not the end-all, be-all authority.","My entire mission in life is to help women take over the world. Not by force (the route so many men have taken since the beginning of time), but with compassion, perseverance, and love.","I was a regular little boy who also enjoyed things that girls did.","Fights with my father were really quite brutal. I would not live his vision. I would not become who he wanted me to be. Everything I did was criticized. I would spend three months drawing something and show him, and he would look up from his paper and just look back down. I got no approval from him for anything I did that was creative."],"Keyshawn Johnson":["The definition of swagger, in my opinion, is you have to have that arrogance, that confidence that you are the best out there at all times.","When I'm on television, I'm talking to millions of people, so the conversation is totally different. My words are different. My diction is different because now I'm really talking American English and not homeboy English.","At the end of the day, all I want to do is protect my kids.","I'm trying to build a brand, so I can sell Keyshawn Johnson products in stores. You know, paint, rugs, carpet, drapery, fabrics, blankets, towels, hardware, plates.","There are already gay players in the NFL and have been for a while.","If you were ever to interview me after a football game or at a football game or around me during football season is totally different than when you catch me away from football.","I'm not even thinking about going back to play football at all. My mind's made up. I'm done.","The championship, in my eyes, in television, is obviously an Emmy.","I never really called people out. It was more along the lines of teasing a person. It started for me in fifth grade on the basketball court.","I'm smart enough to know, 'Don't try and make any headlines.'","So many times in my life, people have tried to make me a failure.","How can you not respect somebody like me? If you don't respect me, it's because you got hatin' all over you. If you don't like me, you don't like yourself.","The wide receiver position is such a complex position.","I know talent when I see it. I know frauds when I see 'em. I know players that can play and can't play.","When I came out of college, shoe companies can identify marketable people, and I think I was identified as someone who could potentially move some units and merchandise.","I was the first athlete, from a training standpoint, with Adidas to have their own signature shoe.","Only a handful of professional football athletes have had a signature shoe, unlike in basketball where there have been a number of guys.","There are not a lot of athletes that are going to get their own shoe.","No man is invincible.","I'm not a savior."],"Kgalema Motlanthe":["I have a political attitude, but I'm certainly not a politician.","Once it gets to a point where it becomes a matter of life and death to occupy a position of leadership or not, with an eye on future opportunities, therein lies the danger.","I don't want to lead an organization where I have no sense of what the members think of me - and by arrangement. I would never do that.","I know exactly what I will do. I will go and work with the Congress of South African Students.","If there are activists in Cosas and they do poorly academically, then they would be cited as examples as to why others should not be in Cosas."],"Khabib Nurmagomedov":["I don't fight for the money. I fight for my legacy. I fight for history. I fight for my people.","I'm from Dagestan, I'm born in Dagestan, and Dagestan is a different level for people living a tough life, people living in the mountains.","I don't think I'm a bad guy from Dagestan. I think I'm a good guy from Dagestan. But for my opponents, for sure, I'm a bad guy because when I go to the cage every time, I smash my opponents.","My best background is, like, smash opponents. I all the time go forward. I all the time try to take down somebody. Make him give up. This is my style, you know. This is what I do all my life.","I know America is very nice and very good people. I'm a professional athlete. I come here. I never have a problem with somebody about my religion, about my name. I am happy. I'm always comfortable because I never do anything wrong. All the time I do something right. I follow all the rules.","I train, eat, sleep, and repeat.","Give me 30 minutes rest, little drink of water. Give me 30 minutes, and I can fight with anybody.","I came to the UFC to fight with top-level fighters and become the undisputed, undefeated champion. This is my goal.","You have to punch hard for knockouts, and to beat me, you have to knock me out.","I feel I represent my country: not only my country but all former U.S.S.R. countries because I have very big fan base here, and I have more than a billion Muslim fans. I feel I represent these guys all around the world. My fans. This gives me very good energy. When I go to the cage, I think about these people.","I think about only me.","I don't know about politics so much. I'm a professional athlete.","My style is not like anyone's. I'm not a typical wrestler.","I want to stay humble, but I have to talk because the other guys talk too much, and... I understand the crazy power the UFC PR machine has.","Next fight? If the UFC tell me, 'What do you want?' I'm going to say Tony Ferguson.","When I fought with Michael Johnson, when I took his arm for the kimura, I can break it, but I go very slowly, be careful, because I don't want to give him injury.","I don't think about, 'Oh, I'm finally getting my respect,' because I don't care about this.","I need eight weeks, train hard, last one week make weight, and go to the war. Because when I go to the war, I have to know I am ready or no.","They're all fake belts. To be honest, I think real belt is Tony Ferguson's.","Of course I am tough, but I am smart, too. I'm more smart than tough. People watching my record and say that this guy is tough. This is not about tough; this is about mind. You think when you fight. This is about everything.","I never fight for the money, but every person is different.","I care about my legacy.","These guys talk when I'm injured, but when I'm healthy, where are these guys? Tony or Conor, it doesn't matter. Or maybe they're going to fight it each other? It doesn't matter.","I never have a problem with the weight cut. My number one enemy is injuries because I train so hard.","Where is Conor? He wanna fight with a bus. I want to fight with a real gangster. Iaquinta, thank you so much."],"Khaled Hosseini":["Qualities you need to get through medical school and residency: Discipline. Patience. Perseverance. A willingness to forgo sleep. A penchant for sadomasochism. Ability to weather crises of faith and self-confidence. Accept exhaustion as fact of life. Addiction to caffeine a definite plus. Unfailing optimism that the end is in sight.","I'm a pretty uncomplicated person. I live a very simple life with my family and I enjoy very ordinary things.","People find meaning and redemption in the most unusual human connections.","Life just doesn't care about our aspirations, or sadness. It's often random, and it's often stupid and it's often completely unexpected, and the closures and the epiphanies and revelations we end up receiving from life, begrudgingly, rarely turn out to be the ones we thought.","Too often, stories about Afghanistan center around the various wars, the opium trade, the war on terrorism. Precious little is said about the Afghan people themselves - their culture, their traditions, how they lived in their country and how they manage abroad as exiles.","In Afghanistan, you don't understand yourself solely as an individual. You understand yourself as a son, a brother, a cousin to somebody, an uncle to somebody. You are part of something bigger than yourself.","Syria's neighboring countries cannot and should not carry the cost of caring for refugees on their own. The international community must share the burden with them by providing economic aid, investing in development in those countries, and opening their own borders to desperate Syrian families looking for protection.","Everyone is an ocean inside. Every individual walking the street. Everyone is a universe of thoughts, and insights, and feelings. But every person is crippled in his or her own way by our inability to truly present ourselves to the world.","Nothing happens in a vacuum in life: every action has a series of consequences, and sometimes it takes a long time to fully understand the consequences of our actions.","I spent a lot of winters in my childhood flying kites with my brother, with my cousins, with friends in the neighborhood. It's what we did in the winter. Schools close down. There was not much to do.","Write the story you need to tell and want to read. It's impossible to know what others want, so don't waste time trying to guess.","The Taliban's acts of cultural vandalism - the most infamous being the destruction of the giant Bamiyan Buddhas - had a devastating effect on Afghan culture and the artistic scene. The Taliban burned countless films, VCRs, music tapes, books, and paintings. They jailed filmmakers, musicians, painters, and sculptors.","You write because you have an idea in your mind that feels so genuine, so important, so true. And yet, by the time this idea passes through the different filters of your mind, and into your hand, and onto the page or computer screen - it becomes distorted, and it's been diminished.","My books are about ordinary people, like you, me, people on the street, people who really have an expectation of reasonable happiness in life, want their life to have a sense of security and predictability, who want to belong to something bigger than them, who want love and affection in their life, who want a good future for the children.","I landed in Kabul the day before Shock and Awe in Iraq, and you could all but hear the collective groan.","For a novelist, it's kind of an onerous burden to represent an entire culture.","I have met so many people who say they've got a book in them, but they've never written a word. To be a writer - this may seem trite, I realize - you have to actually write.","In Afghan society, parents play a central role in the lives of their children; the parent-child relationship is fundamental to who you are and what you become and how you perceive yourself, and it is laden with contradictions, with tension, with anger, with love, with loathing, with angst.","Kabul was very popular with the hippies in the Sixties and Seventies. It was very quiet and peaceful.","In many parts of the world, a man's accusing finger always finds a woman. But I think we need women to solve the problems that men create.","The experience of writing 'The Kite Runner' is one I will always think back on with fondness. There is an energy, a romance in writing the first novel that can never be duplicated again.","The bewildering success of my books continues to surprise me.","I find myself drawn to that period where children are about to leave childhood behind. When you're 12 years old, you still have one foot in childhood; the other is poised to enter a completely new stage of life. Your innocent understanding of the world moves towards something messier and more complicated, and once it does you can never go back.","Read the kinds of things you want to write; read the kinds of things you would never write. Learn something from every writer you read.","I'm so fascinated by how people destroy each other and love each other.","I do live with the very real possibility that we don't have endless stories to tell.","The jury is out as to whether the Afghans are up to the task of protecting their people.","In my 20s, life seemed endless. At 49, I've had a chance to see how dark life can be, and I am far more aware of the constraints of time than when I wrote 'The Kite Runner.' I realise there is only a limited number of things I can do.","You must not believe your own PR; it would be grotesque.","I'm fascinated by the way early experiences haunt and revisit you, remain present in your life for decades and decades - they can even shape who you ultimately become.","Afghanistan is a rural nation, where 85 percent of people live in the countryside. And out there it's very, very conservative, very tribal - almost medieval.","When I went to Kabul - weeks after I finished 'The Kite Runner' - I met a lot of people from all walks of life: men, women, children, people from ministries, hotel doormen, shopkeepers. And I learned from them what daily life was like when the rockets were flying overhead.","I think that to fully appreciate baseball, it helps to have been born in the U.S.","I give novels as gifts, and there is nothing I like to receive more as a gift.","I don't listen to music when I write - I find it distracting.","I remember reading 'The Grapes of Wrath' in high school in 1983. My family had immigrated to the U.S. three years before, and I had spent the better part of the first two years learning English. John Steinbeck's book was the first book I read in English where I had an 'Aha!' moment, namely in the famed turtle chapter.","I entered the literary world, really, from outside. My entire background has been in sciences; I was a biology major in college, then went to medical school. I've never had any formal training in writing.","There isn't, even now, a great tradition of novel-writing in Afghanistan. Most of the literature is in the form of poetry.","I've been told, and I think I recognize it, that there's a cinematic quality to my writing, with a sense of image and place and scene - and, some would say, my tendency to finish my books the way Hollywood finishes its films.","My memories of Kabul are vastly different than the way it is when I go there now. My memories are of the final years before everything changed. When I grew up in Kabul, it couldn't be mistaken for Beirut or Tehran, as it was still in a country that's essentially religious and conservative, but it was suprisingly progressive and liberal.","When I go to Afghanistan, I realize I've been spared, due to a random genetic lottery, by being born to people who had the means to get out. Every time I go to Afghanistan I am haunted by that.","Literary fiction is kept alive by women. Women read more fiction, period.","Whatever the readers feel when they're reading my books, I feel it tenfold when I'm writing it.","I think the emancipation of women in Afghanistan has to come from inside, through Afghans themselves, gradually, over time.","I grew up in a society with a very ancient and strong oral storytelling tradition. I was told stories, as a child, by my grandmother, and my father as well.","I lay no claim, it should be clear, to being a historian. So in my books, the intimate and personal have been intertwined inextricably with the broad and historical.","My books are love stories at core, really. But I am interested in manifestations of love beyond the traditional romantic notion. In fact, I seem not particularly inclined to write romantic love as a narrative motive or as an easy source of happiness for my characters.","Reading is an active, imaginative act; it takes work.","It's a very nice kind of quasi-fame being a writer, because you remain largely anonymous and you can have a private life, which I really cherish. I don't like to be in the public light all that much. I don't crave the whole fame thing at all.","I will say that there is an inordinate amount of medicine in my novels, especially the first one. There are a lot of medical things that happen. A hip fracture, three different kinds of lung cancer, pneumonia, blood poisoning, and so on.","Ultimately, my books are not about the politics, although the toil and the struggle and the wars in Afghanistan have a significant impact on the lives of my characters.","American high school culture was impenetrable to me, and very cliquey: you had the Hispanics, the African Americans, the surfer guys and the goths and the immigrants. The jocks and the surfers got the girls. By the time I'd got to grips with it, I'd graduated.","I was good at being a doctor; my patients liked me. At times people trust you with things they wouldn't tell their spouses. It was a real privilege.","There's nothing easy about writing. It's always difficult. It's always a struggle.","My wife is my in-home editor and reads everything I write.","The only two places where I can read for long stretches are in airplanes and in bed at nighttime.","I don't think she is underappreciated, certainly not among writers, but Alice Munro is the classic underappreciated writer among readers. It is almost a cliche now to wonder why this living legend is not more widely read.","I read actual physical books and have thus far avoided the electronic lure.","I have a particular disdain for Islamic extremism, and of course, in both 'The Kite Runner' and 'A Thousand Splendid Suns' that's obvious.","Usually in films, when Muslims pray, it's either before or after they've blown something up.","A Western-style democracy in Afghanistan is a dream. I don't see that as a reality anytime soon. But I think some form of representative political process is not that far-fetched.","For me as a writer, the story has always taken precedence over everything else. I have never sat down to write with broad, sweeping ideas in mind, and certainly never with a specific agenda.","The difficulty of writing a second novel is directly proportional to how successful the first novel was, it seems.","I am always revolted when Islamic leaders, from Afghanistan or elsewhere, deny the very existence of female oppression, avoid the issue by pointing to examples of what they view as Western mistreatment of women, or even worse, justify the oppression of women on the basis of notions derived from Sharia law.","All stories I write are compulsive. Anything I've ever written was because I don't have a choice. I write stories because I can't wait to tell it, I can't wait to see how it ends.","Economic chasm between people is something that is of interest to me. And something that I used to write about even as a child. It's something I've revisited a few times in my writings.","I don't outline at all; I don't find it useful, and I don't like the way it boxes me in. I like the element of surprise and spontaneity, of letting the story find its own way.","Writing for me is largely about rewriting.","I have this almost pathological fear of boring the reader.","To me, families are puzzles that take a lifetime to work out - or not, as often is the case - and I like to explore how people within them try to connect, be it through love, duty, or circumstance.","Afghan women, as a group, I think their suffering has been equaled by very few other groups in recent world history.","I have met so many people who say they've got a book in them, but they've never written a word.","You have to write every day, and you have to write whether you feel like it or not.","I'm glad I wrote them when I did because I think if I were to write my first novel now, it would be a different book, and it may not be the book that everybody wants to read. But if I were given a red pen now, and I went back... I'd take that thing apart.","I felt on the periphery of high school culture; one of those invisible creatures that walk the campus. I think it was a lot worse for my parents.","You have to be able to interact with people whose politics you disagree with.","Afghan people are just so tired of war.","I grew up around a lot of Rumi, Hafez and Omar Khayyam books. My parents in Kabul had all the volumes around the house."],"Khaleda Zia":["It is impossible to practice parliamentary politics without having patience, decency, politeness and courtesy.","The nation voted us to power to see unity and communal harmony, not for any division or communality.","Factors affecting effective regional cooperation are mindsets and perceptions emanating from the past.","Vote for me and I will ensure that everyone gets enough to eat and a place to stay.","If Bangladesh succumbs to the rule of one family, it would be a major step backward for the region.","Does any one know the number of illegal arms in the country?","The bombers were enemies of Islam and enemies of the country. We will do everything and anything needed to stop them.","Southeast Asia is now a region full of hope because of the freedoms America has helped foster."],"Khalid":["Positivity, confidence, and persistence are key in life, so never give up on yourself.","I would classify myself as an individual. That's what I try to stay true with - being myself, 100 percent.","For me, love is endless, and love has no age limit.","Love crosses all boundaries.","Once you're comfortable with the way that you're dressing, you express yourself a lot more, and you're just able to have a lot more fun.","I use my clothing choices as a way to express how I feel.","I always try to be nice. I never want to be that person that anyone perceives as being rude or disrespectful, 'cause that's not me at all.","I love visiting my friends because it makes me feel normal.","Being timeless means you can listen to something when you're feeling a certain way, and it still has that same power as it did when you listened to the record for the first time. Timeless is abnormal. It sticks out. It can't be recreated.","I gotta spread all this love that I have for myself, I gotta spread it to everybody else, because my positivity is going to change at least one person's day a day, and that's all that matters to me.","I was told I wasn't good enough, but I just chose not to listen.","I just love matching sets. Tops and bottoms that are the same color are awesome to me, because you can get them in so many different colors - neon colors.","It's my job to accept my youth, to spread my story, to let people know who I am as an individual, because there's so many people who are blinded and think less of me because of my skin color.","I'm an African-American man with an Afro who isn't your typical athlete - who wasn't as masculine as other guys.","For me, when I grew up, I never really had an outlet when it came to my social surroundings. Even if I had a form of popularity, I felt like I was very limited.","A lot of people feel pressured by the outside influences, whether it's your job, whether it's school. But who says you can't take care of that stuff and still be young?","And even though I'm famous, I still go through things that young people go through.","I've got to thank the city of El Paso for standing behind me.","I can't play an instrument to save my life. But when I'm creating, and when I'm making music, I feel like I'm the head of the orchestra, and I'm just waving my wand, and something is created.","Being vulnerable was difficult for me at first because I've said things in my songs about how I felt that I never told anybody.","My mom is my biggest inspiration by far. She inspires me on a daily basis. I remember hearing her sing around the house, and I was like, 'Mom, you belong on TV. You're a superstar.'","I suffer from anxiety, moments of depression. I'm in my head so much, and I'm thinking so much, I'm playing a tug-of-war within my mind.","When I started writing, I said, 'I don't know how to do this. I don't know if it sounds good.' Coming from being an underdog or being told that something wasn't for you over and over repeatedly, it took a lot out of me. It took a lot of my self-confidence.","I feel like we go through different stages of love. When you get a little bit older, love starts to feel different, but you see that love has always been there.","My mom raised a self-aware kid. I wasn't like the typical alpha male. I wasn't afraid to sing, you know? I wasn't afraid to be in musicals.","I got joked on. You had people saying I was stupid, that I was lame, that I was feminine, this and that. I was like, 'OK, but I'm still gonna be successful, and you're not.'","You're not a real fan if you don't know how to say my name.","I was very confused with where my life was heading, but I knew that whatever I did, music was going to be involved.","Kendrick Lamar deserves a Grammy. He's one of the biggest, most influential rappers of my generation.","Uzi is insanely good and super creative.","I wrote 'Saved' as a form of therapy to get over the fact that I had moved and lost so much of myself.","The first songs I made brought me to the Grammys. I was a five-times nominated teenager off voice memos and songs that were clearly recorded off different mics.","It's crazy that people are looking to me as a symbol like, 'Oh, he's the voice of the youth. He's this and this and that.' I feel like there's a lot of pressure that comes with it, when people look to you as the face of something.","There's been a time where I was like, I wanna be a folk singer; no, I wanna sing soul. I want to sing classical music. I want to sing R&B. I want to be on Broadway. I just wanna sing. Whatever comes out of my mouth, that's what I want to do.","I've met so many new fans and amazing people while traveling to new cities and locations throughout 2017 in support of my album 'American Teen.'","I feel like baggy pants are cool.","Combing your hair after a long time is terrible.","I try to take all of my experiences in and not take anything for granted.","To be recognized and accepted by my musical peers is truly an honor.","I'd love to collaborate with Frank Ocean. He's one of my favorite artists of all time.","I'm really excited about what the future holds and to grow as an individual and as an artist.","Even though I was super personal with 'American Teen,' I want to tap in and not just tell my own stories but tell the stories of other people - so that I can help as many people as possible.","My peers inspire me, especially being a newer artist.","I've felt like an outcast most of my life, being in multiple high schools and being a military child.","If you don't text your relationship partner - even if you just saw them in person - it's like you're doing something wrong.","It wasn't like I was specifically wanting to write songs about technology. It's just what I lived, what I was experiencing growing up.","With 'Location' and all the other songs around it, my music turned into therapy for others. And that's something I really love and am blown away by.","A lot of people think teenagers haven't gone through anything in their lives - they're not even 20 years old yet. But a twenty-something can go through the same type of experience or heartbreak that a 50-year-old can go through, so why does age matter?","I would never have been able to find my voice if I didn't have music education.","In my home, we listened to music all the time. I was raised through music, and I've been interested in it since I was three.","I've been singing since I could talk correctly.","I'm a regular guy, and I don't want anyone to look at me as being superior or having a God complex or anything like that, you know? I don't want to walk around like I know everything, because I have so much more room to improve.","What really keeps me grounded is my fans and the way that I connect with them.","As an artist, I never want to be a moment. I want to be a legacy, and I want my music to touch people for years to come.","My mom and I, we have trust within each other because at one time in our lives, we were kind of all that we had, you know? My mom had me, and I had her.","I moved from New York to El Paso in 2015, just before my senior year. I was super nervous. My mom, she's in the Army, and she got stationed at Fort Bliss. We packed everything up and drove all the way to El Paso.","I started writing out all of my feelings, and people asked me, 'Have you ever thought of recording your music?' It was something I'd always thought of, but I'd never really had the confidence.","We were told not to turn our hobby into our job, but to turn our job into our hobby. As kids, we were told not to pursue our dreams!","I knew what I wanted and where I wanted to go. I always wanted to entertain and help others.","I knew if I worked hard enough that I'd be successful and eventually give opportunities to others.","I want to venture out into music education for kids. As a child, I was discouraged by a lack of money, and now I want to use my platform to give back to kids without resources.","My mind was so geared towards being a performing artist, singing all these classical pieces, but the sense of loneliness I got when I moved from New York to El Paso meant that writing turned into singing. I'd sing all these songs, and they'd make me feel better. Songs that crafted the way my life was going to go.","I'm still proud of who I am, of my youth, and I feel like now, as individuals, we begin to realise that we can change the future. We all have to participate.","I definitely associate songs with the places that I've been.","We forget that when you grow up, there are a lot of people who are in the same position as you. The reason we forget is because there's not really a true voice that talks from the perspective of youth.","A lot of my songs are about loneliness and losing relationships. Even the ones that are happy, there's a lonely undertone to them.","I had originally planned to do musical theatre and be on Broadway, but then my love for poetry also set in. Once that happened, I became torn between a career as an English teacher or a music teacher.","When I wanted to be a music teacher, I wanted to help people through voice. Now, I get to help people out through song.","I worked hard on making a body of work that takes people on a journey. It was never about making a certain type of song. It was simply about embracing real-life situations.","I want people to know that it's OK to have feelings; it's OK to be vulnerable. That no matter where they live around the world, teenagers all go through the same things.","Falling in love in high school and falling out of love - it's very digital. I've had breakups where they've called me to tell me we were done, and I've gotten a lot of text messages from an old girlfriend letting me know how she felt about me after we had ended everything.","Art is fluid, and it travels. You have to let music take you where it wants to take you. You can't necessarily be the controller.","I didn't feel like I had a home until I moved to El Paso.","El Paso is where I started. I don't feel like I'd be making the music I'm making now if I hadn't gone there.","My high school was what crafted my interest in recording.","I was in the sixth grade and living in Germany, when I was hanging out late with some friends. I turned around, and there's a dude dressed up as Michael Myers following us all the way home. It was the scariest thing ever, and it always reminds me of Halloween. In my mind, I was so young, so I really thought it was Mike Myers following me home.","Joel Little and I have this certain chemistry we have when we work together.","Lorde is awesome. She's amazing. She's so talented. We went on tour in Europe, and it was the greatest time of my life.","The thing about going back to El Paso, it's overwhelming sometimes. I look at the support that I get and the success that I've had, and I can't walk anywhere without being spotted. My hair might be the biggest crime in this situation.","Even though I wasn't born or raised in El Paso, it'll always be a part of me until the day that I die.","I always try to keep my friends within my music. I always play them all of the songs, and they are my biggest critics, and they love it, so that's a good sign."],"Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan":["Thanks to the competence, love of God, our country's security and stability, endowed wealth, integrated infrastructure and quality services, the U.A.E. turned into the world's renowned destination for tourism, investment and business management: the interface of choice for hosting major cultural events, artistic and sports, in the world.","The backbone of any improvement of governance, its development as well as its protection from any form of wastage or excessiveness, is a mechanism to place laws under the microscope of revision and modernization until they resonate in tune with the methodological development and new administrative technologies.","U.A.E.'s continuously growing initiatives in the field of charitable and humanitarian works became a basic component of our foreign activities.","I appreciate my brother, His Highness Sheikh Mohammad Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the U.A.E. and Ruler of Dubai, and the Council of Ministers, who face every morning challenges, but plan and remove all obstacles to score achievements.","Apart from the emergency aid we provide to alleviate the sufferings of victims of natural disasters, calamities and crises, we worked for transforming U.A.E.'s charity activities into an institutional activity with an aim of making them more effective and sustainable."],"Khalil Gibran":["Trust in dreams, for in them is hidden the gate to eternity.","Life without love is like a tree without blossoms or fruit.","Friendship is always a sweet responsibility, never an opportunity.","Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.","For life and death are one, even as the river and the sea are one.","In the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures. For in the dew of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed.","Forget not that the earth delights to feel your bare feet and the winds long to play with your hair.","Doubt is a pain too lonely to know that faith is his twin brother.","I have learned silence from the talkative, toleration from the intolerant, and kindness from the unkind; yet, strange, I am ungrateful to those teachers.","Yesterday is but today's memory, and tomorrow is today's dream.","But let there be spaces in your togetherness and let the winds of the heavens dance between you. Love one another but make not a bond of love: let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.","Progress lies not in enhancing what is, but in advancing toward what will be.","I love you when you bow in your mosque, kneel in your temple, pray in your church. For you and I are sons of one religion, and it is the spirit.","Your daily life is your temple and your religion. When you enter into it take with you your all.","If your heart is a volcano, how shall you expect flowers to bloom?","Generosity is giving more than you can, and pride is taking less than you need.","When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy. When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.","The teacher who is indeed wise does not bid you to enter the house of his wisdom but rather leads you to the threshold of your mind.","If in the twilight of memory we should meet once more, we shall speak again together and you shall sing to me a deeper song.","And ever has it been known that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation.","If you love somebody, let them go, for if they return, they were always yours. And if they don't, they never were.","Beauty is eternity gazing at itself in a mirror.","Love one another, but make not a bond of love: Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.","March on. Do not tarry. To go forward is to move toward perfection. March on, and fear not the thorns, or the sharp stones on life's path.","Out of suffering have emerged the strongest souls; the most massive characters are seared with scars.","Your living is determined not so much by what life brings to you as by the attitude you bring to life; not so much by what happens to you as by the way your mind looks at what happens.","And forget not that the earth delights to feel your bare feet and the winds long to play with your hair.","Yesterday we obeyed kings and bent our necks before emperors. But today we kneel only to truth, follow only beauty, and obey only love.","Let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit.","Faith is an oasis in the heart which will never be reached by the caravan of thinking.","Only when you drink from the river of silence shall you indeed sing. And when you have reached the mountain top, then you shall begin to climb. And when the earth shall claim your limbs, then shall you truly dance.","I prefer to be a dreamer among the humblest, with visions to be realized, than lord among those without dreams and desires.","When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.","Rebellion without truth is like spring in a bleak, arid desert.","We choose our joys and sorrows long before we experience them.","Life without liberty is like a body without spirit.","Keep me away from the wisdom which does not cry, the philosophy which does not laugh and the greatness which does not bow before children.","You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.","Wisdom ceases to be wisdom when it becomes too proud to weep, too grave to laugh, and too selfish to seek other than itself.","Sadness is but a wall between two gardens.","To be able to look back upon ones life in satisfaction, is to live twice.","Generosity is not giving me that which I need more than you do, but it is giving me that which you need more than I do.","I existed from all eternity and, behold, I am here; and I shall exist till the end of time, for my being has no end.","Faith is a knowledge within the heart, beyond the reach of proof.","Love and doubt have never been on speaking terms.","The most pitiful among men is he who turns his dreams into silver and gold.","Perplexity is the beginning of knowledge.","Love is trembling happiness.","A friend who is far away is sometimes much nearer than one who is at hand. Is not the mountain far more awe-inspiring and more clearly visible to one passing through the valley than to those who inhabit the mountain?","Truth is a deep kindness that teaches us to be content in our everyday life and share with the people the same happiness.","Ever has it been that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation.","All that spirits desire, spirits attain.","A little knowledge that acts is worth infinitely more than much knowledge that is idle.","Work is love made visible. And if you cannot work with love but only with distaste, it is better that you should leave your work and sit at the gate of the temple and take alms of those who work with joy.","Your friend is your needs answered.","When love beckons to you, follow him, Though his ways are hard and steep.

Forever.","Most people who ask for advice from others have already resolved to act as it pleases them.","The just is close to the people's heart, but the merciful is close to the heart of God.","When we turn to one another for counsel we reduce the number of our enemies.","If you cannot work with love but only with distaste, it is better that you should leave your work.","I wash my hands of those who imagine chattering to be knowledge, silence to be ignorance, and affection to be art.","If you reveal your secrets to the wind, you should not blame the wind for revealing them to the trees.","Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself. They came through you but not from you and though they are with you yet they belong not to you."],"Khandi Alexander":["This hiatus coming up I'm looking at a comedy because I need the balance.","I feel that the work that I have done in the comedy arena, is priceless in terms of what I learned, timing, everything that these incredibly talented performers were generous enough in teaching me.","I like comedy, I love it very much, I love laughing.","I don't like to be pigeonholed; I don't like when people won't see me for something because they don't think I can do it. I always feel like, at least give me the shot.","I said, 'I'll give myself two years. If I can't support myself as an actress within two years, then I'll go back to choreography.'","So the only things I was being allowed to audition for were small roles in comedies. It broke my heart. No one would see me for anything else. I knew, in order to open up my career, I had to leave or that's all I would ever be given.","Talk about divine intervention. I can't even tell you how blessed I feel.","There's nothing worse than having a very strong female character and then suddenly having it go away.","I have deep comedic roots, and I want to be funny.","In the case of 'News Radio,' I loved that show. I loved the actors and the producers, but I was longing very much for something more to sink my teeth into me. I think it was an incredibly smart show, but I found myself on the peripheral of a lot of it.","I had always done theater during the entire six years I was with 'CSI: Miami.'","I have always loved Scott Foley.","I don't know anyone who's 100 percent pure - nor do I have any interest in portraying anyone like that.","I never saw a consistent through-line of employment for black actresses. I was like, 'How are they supporting themselves?'","When you stop to take a minute and look at Queen Latifah's career, she came out of the box right. You know, 'Ladies First!' And she's been consistent with that message of female self-empowerment. She really has!","I love playing characters that are unrecognizable.","I started a list of all my friends who had died of AIDS, and I stopped at 78. I think about things like that, and I'm just real glad to be here.","Stupidity took me pretty far.","I love that movie 'Chicago.'","I never get recognized. Most of the time, when people think they know me, they believe I'm a member of their family. And that's the way I like it. That's just fine.","I really enjoy working on 'Scandal.' It's so much fun.","When you've worked as long as I have, which I'm truly grateful for, you go in and out of these different environments. Sometimes it's not so much fun or easy or healthy. Sometimes you're fighting a lot of things off-camera that have nothing to do with the work on-camera.","On 'Scandal,' the majority of the cast, if not all of the cast, comes from theater, so it's a healthy environment. People come into work and actually go home to their families."],"Khil Raj Regmi":["Federalism should be a meeting point of all groups.","Federalism should be able to maintain unity among all. But this does not mean that we should boycott regional voices and the voices of ethnic groups.","I took charge of the government as per my commitment to serving the country and the people, and not out of any greed for yet another post.","None of the constitutional, legal or other principles bars me from returning to the judiciary, since the judiciary remains independent if the actors remain independent and fair."],"Khleo":["I can't stop biting my nails. It's a bad habit of mine. I like anything to do with math and numbers. I know a lot of people don't like geometry, but for me it's fun.","I've been a fan of The Rock ever since he first came to wrestling. Every time I went to school, I talked about The Rock. So when I finally got to meet him I couldn't believe it! When he walked through the door, I went bug-eyed! 'I'm standing next to The Rock, man!' He's huge. He's very nice, though.","At a very young age, I was in Germany watching TV and I told my mom I wanted to be an actor. She said, 'Go for it.' When my dad retired from the military, we moved to Los Angeles, and it all kicked off.","There's nothing I missed out on. I do everything a normal kid does. My parents keep me grounded. I still play sports. I still go to a rec center every day.","I prefer home school because you learn more by yourself than when you're around other people because you get distracted.","Every other day I read a book. It takes me two days to finish a book. I like reading because if I'm not doing anything, then I read. If my mom tells me to go take out the trash, I'll go take out the trash, and come back and start reading again."],"Khloe Kardashian":["Fitness is not about being better than someone else... It's about being better than you used to be.","I know my soul is beautiful; I know I'm a good person. And that will never change for me.","We all have to start somewhere, and doing something is better than nothing at all. Start small so you don't get discouraged and give up. Remember it is all about consistency.","I have moments of weakness, but mostly I brush the criticism off... Who cares if I'm not a size zero? I don't want to be. I love my body; I'm healthy, I work out.","I don't believe in revenge. When people are bullies it's because of a deeper-rooted issue - either their family life is tough or they're being bullied by someone bigger than they are.","My fitness journey will be a lifelong journey.","I'm proud of myself. I could break and go get all this plastic surgery and get my nose fixed and get lipo or do whatever, but I haven't chosen to do that because I know I'm a great person. I'm pretty damn hot, if you ask me.","Leopard print has been my thing forever! When I was a teenager my entire room was done in leopard print - it's timeless, chic, and always in style. When in doubt... leopard!","Your life is meant for you to understand and process, not to make anyone else happy.","The Armenian Genocide is such a controversial and very sensitive issue because the Turkish and Armenian people disagree about the facts of what actually happened. I know how strongly Armenians feel about the Genocide, and how it's never been recognised. At the same time, I do not hold today's generation of people accountable.","I love watching 'Golden Sisters' on OWN.","I'm not big on looking up myself. I don't get Google alerts, and I don't look on blogs.","Anyone who pays attention to these things can easily see the incredible bond that everyone in my family shares.","I have moles and freckles, and they irritate me. They are an insecurity of mine, and I wish I could have clear, beautiful skin.","No party is complete without cocktails! My friends all have different tastes when it comes to their drink of choice, so I like to maintain a well-stocked bar with different kinds of alcohol to keep everyone happy.","When I started working out, it wasn't about weight loss; I was going through a really hard time and needed an emotional release. Once you start getting in the tabloids claiming you have fake body parts, then it's like, 'Okay, I made it. Now I'm really working out.'","I was a mindless eater. I ate for comfort. I also ate out of boredom and habit.","All the makeup in the world won't make a difference without great skincare.","Now we have so many more social outlets, so many ways to be stalked and bullied. If social media is too much for you to handle, then don't have a Twitter or Facebook account. Just be yourself. Be who you want to be.","I absolutely adore baking with my nieces and nephews. It's super fun, and I love baking by myself, so what I like to do is have a cabinet for my baking essentials.","I don't have any regrets. I wouldn't change a thing. You learn as you go.","I love hard; I love who I love, and I don't make any qualms about it.","I have a really close relationship with God. I have more conversations with God, and it's very therapeutic to me. It helps me through a lot of trials and tribulations.","But I also enjoy life... the more scrutiny I am under, the more confident I become. I am who I am. I can't do anything about it, and I love who I am.","You can't expect everyone to love you. I'm not someone who just wants to throw out hate, just because.","My hubby is such a sneaker king... and I am a stiletto queen! He always wants to see me in sneakers, but I believe I can do anything in heels.","I genuinely enjoy sweating out my frustrations and living a healthier life. My workouts are not all about vanity. They are about clarity for my mind and soul.","With love, you don't mislead or play around, so if you're not perfectly clear, just be honest about it.","I've learned from experience you just never know what happens in life.","A few years ago I lost 30 pounds, and people still wanted to criticize. And honestly, I'm happy with myself if I'm a little heavier. I realized: 'Why am I trying to conform to someone else's idea of beauty?' I think I'm beautiful either way.","My father raised us like... we were not allowed to see people in any sort of colors, but also we were not allowed to call people fat. If ever we were to say, 'Oh that fat person, or this person,' he would make us put a bar of soap in our mouth and count to 10. We weren't allowed to look at people like that.","All the circuit training, it's cardio circuit training, so everything you're doing, you're still running up your heart rate. You're burning, I think, triple the amount of calories than if you were just weight lifting.","I've made major cutbacks. I used to love soda. So I've cut out soda completely, and I'll drink iced tea or water for what I drink throughout my day. I just made that like a lifestyle change.","Growing up, I was always chubby. My girlfriends were always running around in two-pieces, and I never felt comfortable to do that.","We're all human beings, and we all have the same problems. I do remember how blessed I am, and no matter how bad things are, they can always get worse.","The funny thing is that everyone thinks I'm naturally dark because all of my siblings are, but I'm naturally dirty blond.","I have candles, pictures and flowers on my nightstand... and of course a lamp!","I think the beauty of growing up is not really knowing and figuring it out for yourself.","I had parents who were incredibly loving and nurturing and always made me feel beautiful, so I never really questioned that.","I'm thrilled to continue my partnership with U by Kotex for Generation Know while helping to empower girls. I've always been a motivational resource for my younger sisters and hope I can positively impact and inspire other young girls too.","I do love the evolution of people in general. I think it's a beautiful thing when someone progresses and evolves in life.","I'm Armenian, but I'm very fair and I look white... I would always get such hate about it.","I don't think because I hang out with enough black people, I'm gonna turn black. What kind of rationalization is that? I'm just friends with people that I like. I don't care what skin color you are.","I used to follow trends and try to do exactly what I saw in the magazines, but I'm not a Victoria's Secret model who can wear anything.","I'm the ugly sister. I'm the fat one. I'm the transvestite. I have had those mean things said about me at least twice a day for the last five years. It's horrible, you know? But I can brush that stuff off.","I just let my hair go - if there's no hairdresser around I really can't be bothered!","It's easier to date a football player for sure. Football players have one game a week, and they practice every day, but they're all at home. In basketball, they're on the road all the time.","Not to be vain, but I have nice long legs, so I like to accentuate them. Find what part of your body you love most - it can be your arms, your chest, your legs - and emphasize that.","I don't believe love is fickle. I believe when you love someone, you are allowed to love from afar. You don't have to be with that person in order to love him.","I never looked at myself as the fat sister. Sometimes I would beat people to the punch and say, 'Oh I'm the fat, funny one,' because that's what people would say about me. But I never really thought that.","I don't want a life without my mom in it, but I'm not someone who curls up in the fetal position and says, 'Mommy, take care of me!' I don't like people catering to me. It feels so awkward and uncomfortable.","It's hysterical how kids have their own personalities, even at like 3 or 4. And, it's funny what they tend to like.","I'm a really fun aunt, so I hope I'm going to be a fun mom! I like to have fun and be silly and not take myself too seriously with the kids, so I hope that will translate when I actually have my own.","I started slow, and eventually I started working out 4 to 5 days a week. We all have to start somewhere, and doing something is better than nothing at all.","On the weekend, I have a gym in my community. I try to do cardio. You just turn on some junk TV, and you don't realize what you're doing, and I love that.","There is a method to the madness when it comes to placing everything in your refrigerator.","We come from a very mixed family. We're a bunch of different races, my family. So it's very normal for us. I don't know why we're accepted. Are all of us accepted or just me?","People make me feel like I have a problem because I haven't had a kid yet.","We're all our own worst critics and so hard on ourselves, but for me, my biggest insecurity is my arms. I just hate the tops of them. I work out and they still never look good enough for me. So, over the years I've learned to dress to make myself feel better.","I just think that knowing about your body at any age, whether it's educating yourself on fertility, getting mammograms, going through puberty - whatever it may be, is really important. I just really encourage women empowerment and being comfortable talking about these issues.","I like to do designs on the side of my face, or cut out foil stickers from the crafts store and put them on my forehead.","I love all of my shoes! It is a must to have them color coordinated, and to be able to see each and every one of them. I know exactly where each one lives and I can tell if one has even been moved!","I am an organization freak!","I'm so excited. I love radio and being on the new Mix 102.9.","I'm not shy about wearing a lot of makeup! But when I don't have to be done up, I just use a bit of concealer and maybe some lip balm.","I've had a lot of really influential people in my life, like my grandmother M. J., who have helped me along the way. But there are so many of us girls in my family, and even though they're all so open and honest, who I seek advice from depends on what aspect of life I'm dealing with.","Part of being married is knowing when your husband needs your support.","I'm a modern girl, but you should put your husband first. I like to think divorce is not an option.","I say all the time I think there should be some courses in the regular schooling system that isn't, even like about credit, things that matter later in life. I learned the harder way: 'Look, I got a $500 credit card in the mail, let's go shopping!'","I went to Catholic school and they basically just said don't have sex, but would never explain anything.","If you're too embarrassed and want to hide behind your computer screen, that's what this is for. It's about building confidence and that's what U by Kotex does. Girls owning their bodies and health.","The bikini waxing, after we go there you can't turn back.","My weight fluctuates, like any normal girl, and I have times when I feel insecure.","One of the biggest struggles of my life is my weight. My weight is always going up and down, and I'm always fighting that, and I think that no matter what I do, I'm never going to look good enough to everybody else.","When I was at home, I felt loved and safe. My sisters were always a safe haven for me. I knew they would always play with me and make me feel like I was one of them.","I don't think anybody should ever take their life for being bullied. But if it wasn't for my family... and my circle of friends, I could definitely see why someone would see it doesn't get any better than this, but it does. Life is so beautiful.","Everyone expects me to be 9 feet tall and weigh 200 pounds when they meet me.","I don't feel the pressure by outsiders. I'm not someone who's easily influenced by the public.","A lot of adults don't think it's their place to interfere with kids. I interfere all the time.","If I want to wear a long flowing dress, someone will say I'm pregnant.","I'm not really an actress.","I love doing fashion.","When I did the cover of 'Cosmo International,' Turkey picked it up and I got a lot of backlash for it.","I have two younger sisters and I'm such an advocate of owning who you are as a person. Don't be ashamed or intimidated. Never feel like you are not amazing.","I always have mini bottles of Unbreakable, the fragrance I did with my husband. I'm Armenian, so I'm oily and always have blotting papers.","I live in a world where there's magazines and blogs, and people feel like they are allowed to criticize me, and in the meanest way.","Fame comes and fame goes, but you have to be able to laugh about yourself and to take it with a grain of salt.","To be able to design for the plus-sized consumer, for me, that's just beyond. It's a dream.","I'm strong and fearless and not afraid to take risks in business.","If I'm cooking dinner for my hubby or designing a line or selling on QVC, I try to do it in an authentic way. To speak to people like I want to be spoken to, to be a voice for people who don't have one and to give them things they need and love.","I bought Justin Bieber's house... He had, like, this nook under the stairs which I didn't need, so I covered it up. When I ran into him, he was like 'What did you do with the nook? I used to go in there and play video games.' When I told him it was gone, he was so upset. I didn't think this 20-year-old boy would even care!","I don't care if you marry someone who works at the grocery store or someone who is a director of a company; everyone should have their own identity.","I'm happy - I moved into my new house, which is the first time I've owned a home on my own. It's a big step, and my brother lives with me - I'm so happy about that.","The amount of things I want to tweet that I get talked out of? It's probably four times a week. I'm very hotheaded.","When you genuinely feel like that was the right relationship, you're supposed to give it all you can. That's what marriage is about.","I'm not rushing into my divorce, because I'm not looking to get married tomorrow, so I don't have a deadline. I'm not rushing it. So when it's time, and it's supposed to happen, it will.","I lost like... 13 lbs. from just cutting out dairy.","I pulled back on the divorce because there is no rush for it. For medical decisions and a ton of other things, it's just smarter that it's put on hold.","People are gonna comment no matter what. If I dated the most clean-cut, perfect guy, they're gonna comment. That's just the way it is.","I would say the dumbest thing I have heard is that my dad isn't my real dad.","A few years ago, I lost 30 pounds, and people still wanted to criticize. And honestly, I'm happy with myself if I'm a little heavier.","It is disgusting that 'Life & Style' and 'InTouch' magazines continue to print these false stories about my life: the status of my marriage, false reports about a miscarriage, the horrible lie that my dad is not my biological father, jealousy over my sisters' lives, etc.","Our family brings a different amount of - not fame - attention.","With my divorce, and even during the end of my marriage before it even got publicly bad, how I decided to cope with things was to go on the treadmill for an hour.","I don't mind having people over, but it's weird how much more withdrawn I've become than being social in public places, I guess.","When I was married, or a few years ago, I never thought I was fat. I never thought I was huge. I was like, 'I still look good. I'm just made to have curves or be a little bigger.'","I love doing my makeup - mostly because I'm pretty good at it. What I can't do is hair!","It's crazy how many nude lip crayons I own - I probably need to get rid of some.","I'm like a connoisseur of dry shampoo, so I'm really picky.","I normally like to do a lip pencil and then fill it in with the same pencil because it stays on all day, and you don't have to reapply it.","When you're in a conversation, genuinely be in it. Stare people in their eyes. Know what you're talking about. Enjoy that moment.","When you're at a lunch, enjoy being - I'm always on my phone when I'm at lunch or with things here or there. I've learned to put the phone down and be present.","We live in the public eye, so if one of us makes a mistake, it affects everyone, which makes me think about what I'm doing in life more.","I'm not a big 'cry on a shoulder' person. I'm very introverted when it comes to my own stuff.","Everyone has issues, and I'm not someone who likes to burden people.","I think all diets are kind of weird. The word 'die' is in it.","I believe in lifestyle changes, and when you think of something long term, you do it better. If I know I just have to eat this way for a week, how does that help you for the long term? It doesn't.","I've always wanted to have kids. I do think I would be a great mom.","You can say you're sorry 5,000 times, but that doesn't mean you mean it.","I was married for five years, and I definitely had that baby fever, which I think you should.","With this crazy lifestyle, you have to think of places where you can still have your freedom.","I knew I didn't look like my sisters and I didn't have those shapes, but I didn't think that was wrong.","I didn't realize I was the 'fat' sister until I went on TV and the media started saying that about me.","The gym was my only refuge. I could put music on and dance around with my girlfriends and be silly.","I have never felt 'fat;' I just didn't realise how unhealthy I was until I look back at pictures. In the moment, I felt so beautiful, and I remember walking down red carpets with my make-up done in a little sparkly dress, and I thought I was so cute.","Being an executive producer allows me the opportunity to create original content, and I can't wait to show my fans what we have in store on 'Kocktails with Khloe.'","Everyone says that when you have kids, you become crazy.","I don't really weigh myself, but over time - and I'm not crazy about it - but I know how I want to feel in clothes, and it does become addicting, and once you see results, you want to see more.","It's really hard to watch yourself on TV. It's definitely different in that the world has to watch, too.","I have the same friends that I've had for 15 years. I think also, just by having each other, as soon as one of us gets a big head, we shoot the other one down.","I just don't believe the hype. I just don't take myself too seriously. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.","Most families aren't all in the public eye as we are. It works as a blessing. It works in our favor.","People hate us for showing stuff, and they hate us when we say, 'Fine, we won't show it anymore.'","I promise you, the gym has taken away so much of my stress. It has helped calm me down.","When I'm fidgety, and I just feel like everything is closing in, I go to the gym. You're building endorphins and feeling good about yourself. It's saved me.","I try to work out five days a week. It's a lot, but I feel great when I do it.","I used to not watch what I ate. I would just kind of eat whatever.","I was realizing, 'I work out all the time. Why can't I drop this weight?' It's really food. So I started dieting a little.","The thing is, every relationship is different, and when you start talking about your problems, other people tend to talk about theirs.","I even ate chips because I love the crunchy sound they make. And I didn't give much thought to what I was eating or what I was putting inside my body, except hummus, of course, which is one of my weaknesses.","It wasn't until I began to work out in earnest that I became aware of what I was eating. When I became more mindful about exercise, I became more mindful about eating.","I think most diets are torture, which is why I don't believe in them. But, as is true with exercise, when you make a change and feel the benefits, you want to stick with it.","I'm obsessed with cheese and milk, but eliminating them from my diet made the biggest difference. In a month and a half, I lost 11 pounds just from not eating dairy, without doing anything else different, and that totally blew my mind.","Tracey Cunningham does my color, and little by little, my ombre turned into more of a rooted blond, and then it got lighter and lighter. I love how I stand out more as a blond - it makes me feel bright and healthy.","I've always wanted to get involved in the tech industry, but hadn't come across anything that really clicked for me.","Messaging is such an integral part of our lives, and Begroupd will help solve problems everyone can relate to.","Once you start losing weight and seeing results, you're like, 'I want to see more!'","I want to be a chef, but I'm only a fat girl chef; like, I only like to make fat comfort food. I'm not, like, a healthy chef person.","I don't drink Pellegrino and Perrier, but my nieces and nephews do.","When in doubt, I always, always buy clear vases. You really can't go wrong with minimalist clear vases, especially when you're sending someone flowers. The flowers are the star of the show and need to shine!"],"Ki Hong Lee":["I think I first got into acting through church. I would go to these church retreats, and they would tell us to make a skit or make a video and present it to the rest of the group. And I started doing that. And I fell in love with it.","I never did drama in high school or anything like that. I just kind of fell into it after college, and I pursued it on my own.","I remember talking with a friend. He asked me a question. He said, 'What's your end game? What's your goal with this?' And I said to him, 'You know, I want to win the Academy Award one day.' And he said, 'OK'."],"Kian Lawley":["To all of our viewers out there - expect the unexpected.","I'm known as a person who, like, steps out of the comfort zone. Who kind of breaks the rules and crosses the line in the sense of making YouTube videos.","It's harder than it looks to juggle all those things: relationship, movies, YouTube.","I went from basically filming in my bedroom by myself, filming some funny videos, and then overnight, I switched into filming in some studios and some warehouses and family homes. I started filming with directors and producers and editors, and there were so many people in the room, so it was definitely weird.","We can talk and get feedback about our videos directly from some of our biggest fans. We can't stress the importance of that connection enough.","As someone who started in the digital background, it's an easier, better, faster platform to bounce off of. You already have so much momentum, and you already have the experience. You're already comfortable being in front of the camera.","I act like a kid, and I feel like I need to grow up a little bit. A little bit. Not too much.","We want to create content that our fans will like but at the same time stretches us creatively, with our own little touch.","Whether it's singing, modeling, acting, you name it, they always label you as the YouTuber, the social media kid, the social media star. It's something that I've heard - a lot - but I kind of just put it to the side.","If I want to act, I'm gonna act. And if I consider myself an actor, that's all that matters to me.","I get referred to as the social media kid on set, but I don't let it bother me. I try not to.","I grew up watching Jim Carrey, and I was like, 'I want to be like him. I want to do what exactly what he does.' YouTube was just a platform, kind of like a trampoline to, like, bounce into it at a faster rate.","Working with a full Hollywood team has been an awesome learning experience, and I definitely want to pursue acting more.","I grew up watching 'The Ring,' 'The Grudge,' all those scary movies.","I want to stick with movies, but I also want to stick with YouTube. I'm never going to give up YouTube. I'm never going to stop making videos for the people who continue to watch them. That's my home base. That's what I love; that's what I know.","I'd love to get into comedy and test out new genres of film.","It's hard to act in front of a lot of people.","When I do videos, it's just myself.","Social media stars are kind of taking the traditional route, like movies.","I ripped off half my hair with a waxing strip, and it didn't grow back for, like, 5 months.","I don't really follow the rules of like - not traditional, but how everyone does YouTube. And it's kind of made me more cautious and conscious of what I put into my videos.","Jc and I love our YouTube audience, and we're going to keep producing videos, but we're also really interested in learning what other opportunities are out there.","We've already learned a lot about the production process, and we can't wait for our audience to see what we have in store next.","I do comedy in my room by myself, so it's so different to see how that all works and get the behind the scenes on how they do the gory stuff.","No relationship. I'm not looking for one, either. I've tried it, but it's harder than it seems.","At the beginning, my character Cameron is really family-oriented.","I would film one or two videos a weekend and upload those throughout the week. For a month and a half, I was just constantly filming. There was no downtime. There was always a camera in front of my face."],"Kiana Tom":["Treat everyone with respect and kindness. Period. No exceptions.","My personal goals are to be happy, healthy and to be surrounded by loved ones.","Regarding one's career: always be prepared, no short cuts - hard work is the only alternative that really works.","True wisdom listens more, talks less and can get along with all types of people.","I feel true success comes from being able to work and the love for it.","You are right that I don't have a lot of spare time because I love to stay busy and keep my calendar full.","When I meet successful people I ask 100 questions as to what they attribute their success to. It is usually the same: persistence, hard work and hiring good people.","I always trust my gut reaction; it's always right.","Just kidding, I've been very athletic all my life.","I have my parents to thank for that, they raised me to be active and play all sports. They taught me the importance of staying healthy, being focused and setting goals in whatever I do.","For me, being in front of the camera and training go hand in hand.","They both go together; you can't be in front of the camera hosting a fitness television show in front of 75 million households and not have trained 6 days per week year round - in a bikini no less.","Our viewers are very educated, they can tell if I train or not.","I feel accomplished knowing that I'm still the same at heart.","I'm still a little girl in Hawaii, I have the same friends I had when I was a kid who love me for who I am - not what I do. I never got caught up in the club scene or took wrong roads.","Business wise, I have always learned valuable lessons so I don't regret any decisions I have made.","I appreciate life, talk a lot, love to laugh, and am very optimistic.","I have a quiet and an artistic side that many people don't know of.","I play the piano and have been playing since I was 7, mainly classical Chopin, Beethoven, Mozart.","I also paint and enjoy acrylic medium; some of my close friends have paintings I did for them.","One day I would like to have my own art show.","I also love to surf the Net and talk on the phone with friends.","It's not being superficial, but looks do attract me from across the gym.","Money doesn't buy class.","I like when my man is worldly, knows the finer things in life, is well traveled, educated. It's important to me that he's able to talk to all types of people, from doctors to dishwashers.","Every girl likes to be thought of and made to feel special.","Balance is key: I need to be successful in my career to feel fulfilled, be surrounded by people I care about to share it with, and have my health to be able to do the things I love to do!","I am a goal setter and I set more goals everyday. I keep lists of goals in my office to stay on track.","I am a control freak. I want to do what I want to do.","More Asians need to be on television as a positive role model."],"Kid Cudi":["My life is like a speeding bullet that just hasn't hit the target yet.","Yeah, but if you're not doing what everyone else is doing then you're going to be misunderstood. People are going to wonder why you're trying to be different; it's just a natural instinct.","I just wanna learn and I wanna grow. I wanna consume as much information as possible. I wanna be great.","There was a moment in time where I was really focused on the Navy and I followed through with it - I passed the test. I was happy with myself because I was accomplishing something and I was really working towards a goal. That was the first true thing I invested my energy in.","I went out of my way to make 'Immortal' sound perfect. 'Immortal,' 'Just What I Am,' and 'King Wizard,' those are perfect beats. Not a lot of people can perform on them. I say that meaning they're tailor-made for me.","I hated suits until I wore a Calvin Klein; they just fit me.","I like Louis Vuitton accessories, but I'd never wear their clothes. No offense, it's just not my steeze.","I like to get one pair of shoes and wear them till they're dirty. Besides, I don't walk - I glide, like butter. Float like a vampire. I'm like Louis Vuitton, but smoother. He wishes he were like me.","I'm trying to change the world.","Some people just don't want to see change, but thankfully there are a lot of people more optimistic for something new in music, even with the bigger picture like with Obama getting elected.","My background is not typical hip-hop. I didn't grow up in the projects. I grew up in a single family home in a middle-class suburb. That doesn't mean I didn't experience hardship, but to me it's not about that, it's about the future and where we are trying to take it.","I used to take Sharpies and draw on my pillowcases, and then go to sleep on them and wake up with red marker from the drool all on my face.","I have all these revelations as I'm writing. Each song is like a chapter of my diary.","My whole thing is just to put out positive messages in the music, give people something that can change their lives.","I've always been ahead of the curve when it came to trying new stuff in the underground scene.","I'm not that big a fan of sampling. But I feel like if I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it to where it's more of a reimagining of a track. The songs that I do utilize samples on, most of it you wouldn't even be able to tell what it was unless I told you.","Whatever Kanye tells me, I just try to put it in my little machine and make the perfect solution for it. That's always our collab formula, and that's just how 'Gorgeous' came about.","I've always felt that because I'm from Cleveland, which isn't recognised as a place for hip-hop, I needed to step it up if I wanted to make myself known.","Once I accomplish one thing and I'm satisfied, I try something else. I may be 50 and doing something totally outside of music and acting. Maybe I'll become a kindergarten teacher.","'Just What I Am' took me all of 10 minutes to make. 'Immortal' maybe took 30 minutes. It's not hard for me. 'Indicud' is almost what my first album should have sounded like, had I really been able to channel all of the ideas I had into music.","The tour bus is always fun, and there's plenty of time to watch movies. Actually, Kanye introduced me to the movie 'Step Brothers.' We were sitting there, watching it and clowning around - it was so funny, man.","'Gorgeous' was one of those records that, as soon as I heard the beat, I was like, 'Man, this is the one. This is that 'This Can't Be Life' Kanye beat.'","I'm very close with my family, so my mom is part of my entourage.","I like being a consumer. I'll do collabs with brands I like, only because I would like something free to wear. But I don't want people to dress like me, which is what you're asking when you create a brand. The fashion industry's just a super-duper headache.","In America, we're kind of lazy. But in New York, it's one of those places where you see the majority of people hustling. If you can make it in New York, you can make it anywhere.","I like What Goes Around Comes Around for old concert tees. Oh man, I got this 'Sgt. Pepper' cartoon Beatles shirt there; it was, like, $300. I didn't even know how much it cost - I thought it was gonna be, like, $80 at most - till I got to the register and was like, 'Oh mah gawd!' Good Lord. But it's classic vintage rock, you know?","The world that I am coming from, hip-hop, is so regurgitated and repetitive that some people are used to that and they don't want change, they don't like change. And I get that, that's cool. Luckily for me, I'm confident in myself as an artist where I can do what I want, and as long as I'm cool with it, I'm cool with it.","These things were happening in my life where I was like, 'Man, I wish my pops was here to see this.' I never had those thoughts before fame, when my life was just a regular life. I wasn't saying, 'I wish my dad could be around and see me working at Applebee's.'"],"Kid Nichols":["I consider Billy Keeler, Mike Tiernan, Ed Delihanty and Larrie La Joie the toughest hitters I had to pitch to, but I did not dread them. Remember, Hughie Duffy was a member of our team, so I did not face him. In my opinion, Duffy was the greatest hitter.","In 1906, I developed pleurisy and was unable to get into condition. So I asked for my release and obtained it. So ended my Major League career.","The day after we had pitched a game, it was our duty to stand at the gate, and afterwards to count the tickets. I remember counting 30,000 tickets one day at the Polo Grounds in New York.","If the arm got sore, we went out and pitched until the soreness left - we had to, or we would have been dropped from the team. Nothing short of a broken leg could have kept us out of uniform.","We played for the love of the game; there were few holdouts. We wanted to pitch every day; to win more games than the other guy - not for the money, but for the glory of winning."],"Kid President":["Call me crazy, but I still believe in you grownups!","I'm not in a party. I am a party."],"Kid Rock":["I could care less about what people think. I'm a Devil Without A Cause.","Surround yourself with good people. Whether they're the best or not, people are capable of learning if they've got good hearts and they're good souls.","I never said I wanted to be around for a long time. I always said I wanted to be here for a good time.","Athletes and musicians make astronomical amounts of money. People get paid $100 million to throw a baseball! Shouldn't we all take less and pass some of that money onto others? Think about firefighters, teachers and policemen. We should celebrate people that are intellectually smart and trying to make this world a better place.","If it looks good, you'll see it. If it sounds good, you'll hear it. If its marketed right, you'll buy it. But... If its real... you'll feel it.","But honestly, it's pretty weird; there are girls who'd do absolutely everything just to get a backstage pass. I don't know what it is, but really, when you're on national TV in America the girls love you. They all want you! And I'm not complaining!","I'm not only a fan of Apple products, I have stock in the company. I think Steve Jobs has started one of the greatest corporations in the world.","I think what I've learned out of this lifetime is you should be proud of where you come from.","I'm actually a pretty decent human being, and when I'm home I'm straight as an arrow.","I have nightmares that I'm going to wake up, and everyone's driving a Prius and living in a condo, and we're all getting health insurance.","Make no mistake: Bob Ritchie's up early in the morning taking pictures of his son on the first day of his senior year. Kid Rock is passed out in a hotel room somewhere with four scantily-clad women.","You know, when I started I liked Big Macs and Budweiser and I still like Big Macs and Budweiser.","A common man, even like myself, I don't know how to pay my taxes.","And there's a feeling you get from making music that is unlike anything else in the world.","You've got to work hard for your success and you've got to have a steady presence. That's the secret.","Being a father helps me be more responsible... you see more things than you've ever seen.","Go where you're celebrated, not tolerated. I'm celebrated in Detroit.","I think I did every drug known to mankind, smoked crack, boozed, dropped acid, you name it.","I was the little white kid who rocked the turntables.","Are some women and children going to die? Yeah. But it's doing the right thing. You got money, you sit around talking about peace. People who don't have money need some help.","Europeans don't seem to have the groupie mentality.","I am happy to make money. I want to make more money, make more music, eat Big Macs and drink Budweisers.","I signal with an independent label, Continuum. After that I put out a totally independent record, sold fourteen thousand of them from my basement, bought a house, started raising my kid, made a decent living.","That's why I called my record Devil Without a Cause - I'm a white boy who's so sick of hearing that white kids are going to steal rap.","Why does anything ever happen? Some things happen and some don't.","I bought a book of Mark Twain quotes. That's about my speed. I'll read a couple quotes and put it down.","I always looked up to so many people before me and was lucky to become such good friends with them. I learned so much hanging out with those cats.","These poor kids in Baghdad have no running water, no showers. They wipe with baby wipes. My heart goes out to them.","There's so many examples of just how lucky we are to be born anywhere in this world that is free.","I collect cars and bikes. One of my most special rides is a black 1930s Cadillac V16, and then I've got a few West Coast choppers.","Two of my grandparents died in a car crash. Sucks, 'cause they would have lived to a hundred.","People ask all the time, 'What would you be doing if you weren't Kid Rock?' It's simple: I'd be broke Kid Rock.","As a musician, you want the music in as many hands as you can get it into. More importantly, I want people to get the music for the fairest price, and in the most convenient way. And that's really turned into iTunes when you're talking about selling albums.","I do not understand rehab. If it works for people, then God bless them.","I see friends who are in different genres of music, and they say they're so burnt playing the same stuff every night. That's why you see a country act wanting to go out and play an old classic rock song. But what cracks me up is that they all want to be Jimmy Buffett. I can't figure that out.","As far as my street cred goes, I'll always have that, because I always hang with the kids. I'll jump right off the stage and buy them a beer. I'll be a star on stage, but I'll always hang with the kids.","I love to be pushed so I can prove myself, because once again, I will.","I know a lot of people who are struggling musicians; it's a hard life, and I've risked being that. The rewards are tremendous now that I've made it, I thank God every day. But I put it all on the line for it.","A lot of people told me that I'm committing musical suicide with my sound.","But I'm a great father. That's why I got custody.","Going out hanging out with the troops, and you know it's kind of all summed up in the TV show, I don't what else I can say about it. It's a great thing to do, something I'm definitely proud of.","I always believed it would happen and stuck to my guns.","I care less if I can't be part of your scene because I am the scene. I am everything that is.","I didn't come from a trailer park. I grew up middle class and my dad had money and my mom made my lunch. I got a car when I was sixteen. I'm proud of that.","I didn't want to go out and change anything. I just wanted to make the music that was part of my background, which was rock and blues and hip-hop.","I know every Skynyrd and about all Johnny Cash songs.","I like to make music, I like rap music. Even if I'm white, I support that music. If I want to support it or any other white kid wants to support it more power to them.","I want as many people as possible to hear my music. I'm happy to entertain people by being a star.","It's not that I'm Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes now, but I've got my priorities in order.","My past is a bit checkered.","My shows aren't about trying to save some place, because I don't feel that's the right venue for it. That's my politics right there: Don't bring politics to my shows.","My take on rap is driven by straightforward American southern rock and blues.","On a scale of the United States, the Hollywood influence on what comes out, that's not the majority views of across the country. What we read in Us Weekly or People magazine, or Entertainment Tonight, it's not what the majority of the country is thinking.","Rock 'n' roll is much easier if you're white.","That's what I love from metal, and that's what I love from hip-hop. That's what I love from any music that's hard, that's got an edge to it-The attitude in it.","They believed you can't mix rock, country, and rap, and that crossover is dead. I always knew it would work. And it will always work as long as you're really into it and like what you're doing.","I do not believe that artists or actors and people should be out there like voicing their full-blown opinions on politics because, let's face it, at the end of the day, I'm not that smart of a guy.","I play Rock 'n' Roll, that's what I do.","I've never done songs with people just for the sake of the great combination. I've always done songs with friends.","Detroit: Cars and rock 'n' roll. Not a bad combo.","I know I'm not the best. I'm not the best singer, I'm not the best songwriter, I'm not the best player.","I've paid for more pianos in hotel lobbies than you can imagine.","People in north Michigan are not different at all from people in southern Alabama. Trust me, someone who's spent a lot of time in both places. They're all hardworking, simple people.","I just have never got into reading.","The Majestic Theater in 1990. That was one of my first real shows where I had 300 to 400 people there.","I've never played the PR game.","When I was making my first record there would be something that would come out that would inspire you, you know? You'd see someone on TV or on the radio.","My good friends call me Bobby.","I like who I am.","You know, I guess there's enough information out there to support that I'm a crazy, wild dude and rock and roll and this, that and the other. And there's enough information to support that, you know, I'm a single father, that, you know, has been a pretty standup guy in his community and pretty private about that stuff. But it's on both sides.","There's always a Justin Bieber. Ever since I've been around, there's always been one of him.","If you had told me when I was starting out that I would be coming down to Nashville, kind of weaving in and out of the country scene, I never would've thought that in a million years.","I don't write songs thinking about formats, where is it going to get played, who am I gonna please, what's the outlet for it.","I've got my own studio, so I sit in my studio writing and if I get a great take, that's the take.","I still love old-school hip-hop, but there hasn't been a lot that I've taken from the new stuff.","I'm all about change, and I know things are going to move forward in life, and that's just how it goes.","I've always made music from the heart, and that's what I do.","I've always had a love of country music.","And now that Martina McBride knows of T.I., and T.I. knows of Martina McBride, that made me very happy, too. It's introducing worlds to different people and bringing them together with a song.","I tend to vote Republican, but I don't like the hardcore views on either side, and I'm not in bed with anybody.","I guess there's enough information out there to support that I'm a crazy, wild dude and rock and roll and this, that and the other. And there's enough information to support that, you know, I'm a single father, that, you know, has been a pretty standup guy in his community and pretty private about that stuff.","There's always a Justin Bieber. Ever since I've been around, there's always been one of him. You know, you can trace it back from how old you are and the boy bands that came along then and the teen sensations and whatnot. And, you know, good for them. There's a few of them that make it out and a few of them that don't.","Everything I've done in my career has started in and around Detroit, you know, the metro area and Michigan.","I see the people in Detroit are very - they're like a lot of cities, but they're very proud to be from there and they really want to see change and they really want to see good things happen.","I make a lot of money. I can take a pay cut. All my friends are taking pay cuts that are in the unions, that are - that are farming in Alabama or whatever it is. I can surely take a pay cut, too, not cutting down my show or - or the people that work for me, I can take a pay cut.","Money's really - you know, song writing, yes, there's money to be made and things like that. But really, when you talk about the real money, you talk about touring. No question.","I still believe I have a lot of liberal thoughts, but I also believe when you work hard, you shouldn't be penalized and pay more because you work hard.","I'm not a greedy man; there really is nothing I couldn't live without. But if there was a fire, and I saved my child and my pets, I'd be happy.","I don't read books. I like to read newspapers and magazines, but I've never learnt to enjoy books or novels.","Chris Rock is a good friend of mine, and he is hysterical.","I think generally I'm a pretty good person if I had to grade myself. Or toot my own horn.","I still don't believe that all pieces of music are the same price. I just don't think that's America.","Knowing so many people like myself who are singers and in traveling bands, the people you're in a relationship with feel slighted because they feel you're giving all your energy to your fans, and there's a lot of truth to that.","Tell me if this is wrong. Justin Bieber... is 100 percent like watching Vanilla Ice all over again. It's exactly the same. Well, as soon as Bieber has a hit, he'll be like Vanilla Ice.","There's no way anyone in the world is having more fun than I am. I truly believe that.","Playing a concert for 2 hours is pie. I would do that every minute of every day if I could. I love to perform. It's the 22 hours before the next show that kills you.","I think anybody that's worked hard and has built something and has been successful can testify to how, you know, how wonderful that was, how wonderful it still is.","Getting married was a ball. Being married was... a nightmare.","There's nothing better than seeing people you know being able to work and support their families. Knowing you have a little hand in it? Now, that really makes you feel good.","You know how much money the oil companies have? If you need some gas, just go fill your tank off and drive off - they're not going to miss it.","I don't steal things. I'm rich.","I've got friends who didn't vote. I want to smack them upside the head.","I am an avid hunter and marksman, and I will not hesitate to shoot anyone who has myself or family in fear for our lives.","I take the invasion of my personal space very seriously.","If people had good albums, they'd be buying albums. But people are buying singles because they only have good songs.","The program director at a radio station, by the way, is not the superstar. If he was a superstar, he'd be out creating songs, but he's not. But he wants to act like he has control and power.","I truly believe that people like myself, who are in a position of entertainers in the limelight, should keep their mouth shut on politics.","I think celebrity endorsements hurt politicians.","I have been to anger management twice. After the first session the lady was like, 'Baby, you don't seem that angry at all. You seem like a really nice guy.'","Bringing people together is one of my favorite things... I believed that's what a rock 'n' roll Jesus would really do - bring people together through music.","The spirit of rock 'n' roll is alive and well. It kind of just needs to be cultivated a little bit.","People love to hate other people.","I hate my own attorneys!","All girls want to be sexy.","I don't tell 'U.S. Weekly' which parties I'm going to. I write songs.","My goal is to get quieter as I get older.","When you're on TV in America, the girls love you. I'm not complaining.","I'm in awe of people like Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard; they're great musicians and people. But I'm most starstruck by people in the small town where I live. Especially single dads, like me, who are working five times as hard to raise their kids.","I'm a bit of an insomniac. I'm always thinking. I've got a lot of ideas for lyrics and shows. I have a notepad by the side of the bed and voice recorders around the house.","Every day I feel different about music, but what never changes is my love for it.","I've always made music from the heart, and that's what I do. And at the end of the day, whether it works or not, I can say I tried my best."],"Kidada Jones":["I love Tinkerbell because she's feisty and about it. She's got swag! She's going to do what she wants to do. I even have a Tinkerbell tattoo, and she is wearing Adidas flip-flops!","I think jewelry is beautiful on all women and I think it's sentimental - and Disney is sentimental. It's subtle and it's low-key and it's just a sweet reminder of sweetness.","My family advocates doing what fulfills your soul. They've always said, 'You're a big girl; figure it out on your own.'","I have an affinity for Disney and the Princess.","I had a dog for 20 years and her name was 'Penny,' so I have a penny necklace.","As a kid growing up in Southern California, I was a frequent visitor to the Disneyland and developed a deep love of the magic and wonder of Disney."],"Kidd Kraddick":["Have you ever thought about those last moments of your life? Nobody wants a long, lingering illness; nobody wants just that; but it would be nice if you could have a day or two where you know it's coming.","If I ever retire, I want it to be in the KISS-FM jersey."],"Kiefer Sutherland":["I feel extraordinarily peaceful when I'm watching the sun set.","I've always traveled with a picture of my daughter from 1989, her kindergarten school picture, that has 'I love you, Daddy' written on it. She's always made fun of me because I never changed that picture out. It's like my resistance to her getting older. It was the first thing she'd ever written to me and it means the world to me.","I like chatting with people. If people ask me a direct question, I give them a direct answer and I feel I've always done that with the press.","Yes, I do believe that there is a cause and effect and a ripple effect upon everything everybody does, and they have positive consequences and negative consequences. If you start to focus on the kind of minutia of that, it's really quite extraordinary.","I think the most attractive thing is a sense of humour. If someone can make you laugh, you've gotten a lot out of the way.","I do believe very strongly that all of us and all of the other things in the context of our planet with Mother Nature, all of these things absolutely have a profound effect.","When you're a young actor you like to go for characters with a bit of flair, so in many films I ended up playing the weirdos. I can assure you I'm not a psycho or a criminal or a bully.","There are a lot of movies I'd like to throw away. That's not to say that I went in with that attitude. Any film I ever started, I went in with all the hope and best intentions in the world, but some films just don't work.","I'm a huge fan of Canadian rock-and-roll. When I was growing up, Rush came out with a record called Hemispheres, and I must have listened to that record for two years straight. Even when I was asleep I had it on. So, yeah, whenever I hear a Rush tune, the first thing I think of is Toronto.","When I was younger, my whole sense of self-worth was based on whether or not I was working, which was awful. And I had a baby at 20 years old, so it wasn't just about me. At around the age of 30 there was a stretch where I wasn't working - certainly not on anything I liked, anyway - and I started to do other things.","I've had some amazing people in my life. Look at my father - he came from a small fishing village of five hundred people and at six foot four with giant ears and a kind of very odd expression, thought he could be a movie star. So go figure, you know?","I think that the day you've figured out the differences between women and men is the day that you're no longer attracted to women. It's the difference that is so fantastic and frustrating and angering, and really sexy.","I did a play called Throne of Straw when I was 11, at the Odyssey Theatre in Los Angeles. It became really clear to me at that point that I enjoyed acting more than any other experience I was having.","My parents not only did it for a living, but they were really good at it.","Youth is an amazing thing: I think back on when we did The Lost Boys, and I didn't think I could do anything wrong.","There's a confidence that comes from youth and not knowing better. But there comes a point, as an actor, when you do know better, and that is when the fear starts.","I couldn't see my father's films because they were restricted and we didn't have videos or DVDs back then.","When I saw Virginia Woolf, somewhere between the first and second acts, someone I had known as my mother became somebody else.","When I wasn't the flavor of the week or month or day, those were hard times.","I didn't realize that television has gone through immense changes and has become very progressive.","When we shoot 24, there are so many things I have to worry about, from the script to technical things to my performance, that I don't have a second to be bored or take anything for granted. We produce 24 hours of film a season, which is like making 12 movies.","The writers keep managing to turn the show in on itself, coming up with something that's well thought-out and miraculous.","There are three things we need to do for a band. We need to make a great record; we need to get the record played; and we need to find an audience for the live shows.","There are two things that Jack Bauer never does. Show mercy, and go to the bathroom.","I've made films that I've given all I had to, that no one has seen. The bottom line is I want to work and I want someone to enjoy it.","When Julia and I broke up and I was really scared to go into a market or anywhere because I thought, 'Oh God, everyone must hate me. And that wasn't the case. People said, 'I'm sorry this happened, man. Are you alright?'","My whole mood or sense can change by virtue of the music that I'm listening to. It really does affect me on a visceral and emotional level.","My mother's five-foot-two, and I'll be honest with you - she's the only person I'm scared of.","One of the big draws of the show is here's a guy who is ordinary in a lot of ways but, due to his profession, he's placed in extraordinary situations that he has to make right with action and with thought. That's what is appealing about Jack - he takes charge.","My focus on 9/11 was on the victims - in the towers, in the planes - and all that loss.","I was 20 when my daughter was born, and making all these plans during my wife's pregnancy. I was going to be the perfect father. Once she was born, it was suddenly, 'Oh, my God! I'm a parent!'","Some days I'm in better control and can navigate my way through stuff, and other days, not so much.","If your ethics in the military, in your training, is going to be counterminded by a one-hour weekly television show, we've got a really big problem.","'24' and 20th Century Fox and Sky TV are not responsible for training the U.S. military. It is not our job to do. To me, this is almost as absurd as saying, 'The Sopranos' supports the mafia, and by virtue of that, HBO supports the mafia.'","I loved '24', but I didn't think anyone else would. I had absolutely no idea.","There are aspects of '24' where I love its politics and aspects where I hate them.","When I started, with films like 'The Bay Boy' and 'Stand by Me', I look back on those interviews and I'm amazed; there's no mention of my father; it's not even 'son of Donald Sutherland.' I caught a bit of a break in that it never felt like a weight to me.","You can't ask the press to service you with everything that they have and not expect some of the other stuff in return if you're going to live your life like I have.","I have a very strong political outlook, and that is something I'd like to take more responsibility for in my life. I don't believe in utilising certain aspects of the power I have with celebrity to push that forward, but I would like to make some films that address some of those political issues.","I had an unbelievable experience on '24'. We shot 198 episodes, and I was as excited about shooting the 198th as I was the first.","I love collecting guitars, even though I can't play well. My favourite guitarists are Richie Blackmore, Jimmy Paige, and John Mayer.","I am a bit obsessive about tidiness. I need to make my bed in the morning and leave it perfectly made up.","I'm always jumping in my seat or gasping during a good horror movie.","If you are going to do something potentially for another eight years, you want it to be something that you can really sink your teeth in and that's going to be different and interesting for this next period of time.","Some people think it's because '24' was jump-started by what happened on 9/11. That was never why we made the show. We started production six months prior to 9/11, and we'd already done ten episodes.","The biggest mistakes I made in my career were when I said, 'If I do this movie, I'll be able to do a couple more movies.' Those are the times I really got ugly.","I would love to do '24' until I was 60, but I don't think anybody would accept it."],"Kiele Sanchez":["There is something to be said about a guy who is attractive and doesn't know it. I hate men who are overconfident.","I know with me, you really have to, like, pound me over the head to say, 'I like you. I really like you' to get me to see it. I think if you're too passive, you just fall into that friend role. And that's hard to break out of."],"Kieran Bew":["I always love being an actor for the simple fact that, whenever you do a job, you have to read a lot of stuff that you've never read before; you explore things, and generally you meet experts in lots of fields, and you get to absorb that information and make it look like you've done it for 20 years.","I did quite a lot of fencing when I was a kid. I was a swimmer, and I played a lot of basketball. I was a fencer for Great Britain, but I only did that because I watched 'Robin Hood,' 'Star Wars,' 'Highlander' and 'The Three Musketeers,' and I wanted to emulate Richard Harris and the great British actors that I grew up watching.","You've got something really angsty for me to play? Bring it on. Most of the time, I'm goofing around and doing impressions of people, so that's nice.","Beowulf is not a superhero. He has a talent, very much like Clint Eastwood in 'Unforgiven.' He's very good at staying calm in the right moment, but he does bad things. It's very much about having talent in a tight spot.","At drama school, I got a job choreographing and teaching the fights for Mark Rylance doing 'Hamlet' at the Globe in London when I was only 19. They made me fight captain."],"Kieran Culkin":["Watching a good actor is the best way to learn.","I shut up and keep my ears and eyes open.","It was a lot of auditions and tapings and stuff like that.","When I worked on Altar Boys, they wanted to see us having fun. The four of us would have fun on set and steal each other's lines, and mess with the director.","They put me in a whole body suit, from my neck to my ankles. It was so bad, I couldn't straighten my legs.","The whole family is tight. We all really love each other.","The Professional Children's School, it's for professional kids, so if you wanted to ditch, you could just write, Audition on a note and leave. I didn't really like school all that much.","The divorce was rough on all of us. I don't blame Hollywood for my family's problems. But having all of it reported in the press made it more of an ordeal.","Igby was a really good opportunity for me to grow up. The cast was great.","I think people are going to keep asking me about Macaulay. Some things change and some things don't.","I see Igby as my first movie as an adult, and it's a big deal for me because I really, really like the film.","I liked a lot of the scenes I did with Ryan Phillippe.","I feel different than I did three years ago, in The Cider House Rules.","I don't know how long I'll be trick or treating. Maybe I'll be 80 years old and still trick or treating.","A week before shooting, they told me, You don't have the part, yet. We're still trying to find a handicapped kid who can act. Either that or we break your legs."],"Kiernan Shipka":["I love ballet. Ballet is its own being. It has its own vocabulary. I feel as if I am in a different world when I am in the ballet studio.","I make most of my friends through my extracurricular activities.","I am always texting!","Any day acting is an amazing day.","I do lots of activities. I hang out with friends.","I really get a chance to be a normal kid.","I always try to read at night, because it gets me kind of tired.","I design some of my own clothes now.","I love organization, so I split my clothes into two closets according to seasons.","I hate a messy closet. I totally freak out when my closet is messy and I can't find anything.","I have a Twitter, but I'm not a tweeter... if that really makes sense.","I am a huge fashion fan. It's a really cool way to express yourself.","My style is constantly changing.","I'd definitely like to go to college some day.","I don't know if I've ever screamed or cried for a band.","I do listen to some music, but I don't technically have one band I'm absolutely hooked on.","I follow fashion trends.","I've been playing since I was 5, but I wouldn't say that I'm serious about the piano.","I certainly know quite a few kid actors, but I'm not really friends with them. They're all very nice people, but I just don't run in the same circles.","There's nothing wrong with a lisp.","Some things are worth the splurge.","I'm such a theater geek."],"Kiersey Clemons":["I don't know, I feel like any role that I play is a little piece of me, whether it's their perspective, maybe how they dress, what they think is funny, their loyalty to their friends. It all stems from Kiersey.","I lived just outside of L.A. for a long time. My dad was in the military, so I moved a lot.","I went to high school in Redondo Beach, so a lot of people that went to my school are from Inglewood or Gardena. My best friend lives in Gardena.","When I was younger, I liked writing stories and watching younger actors on TV.","I think a lot of kids I've met in L.A. trying to act want to escape working long days and think acting is all photoshoots and red carpets.","People aren't really mean to me, but people say random things.","I love taking advantage of red carpets."],"Kierston Wareing":["I really like the bohemian look, and I'm a great fan of mixing vintage and modern.","Don't get me wrong, I'm very good, I'm a loyal person and I would never treat anyone badly - what goes around comes around. But I do go for the bad boy. I haven't outgrown that.","I don't want to come across as a victim with a sob story. I've got a fantastic life. I'm not a victim. I thank the bullies out there for making me who I am. Some people become weaker, but the bullies made me stronger.","Anything negative that happens to you in life can be turned into a positive as far as acting is concerned. You can draw on your experiences - it's far better than any research.","I really hope acting is going to be my career to the end, but you don't know anything, really, do you?","I believe life is fated - what's going to happen will happen.","I love all the premieres and everything that goes with it, but my favourite part is being on set and to go to work and enjoy your job. Not many people can say that in life.","If someone tells you often enough you're worthless, you start to believe it.","I get a lot of single mum roles - 'It's a Free World' turned out well, so people thought, 'She can be a single mum, Kierston can do that. Or live in a council house - she can do that.'","I get bored very easily. I do like excitement.","I was studying to be a legal secretary when I was called to audition for 'Ken.'"],"Kiesza":["Beauty has so many forms, and I think the most beautiful thing is confidence and loving yourself.","I believe that anyone can be what they want to be; it just comes down to hard work.","Life experience brings out different emotions and different perspectives on things. I just want to be constantly evolving.","When something really grabs me, I dive into it.","I'm very naturally happy, quirky and positive.","I tend to sort of dive into things without worrying about risk or anything. Like, when I get an idea, I tend to just go for it and see what happens.","I tend to obsess over my passions.","I feel like, when you turn on the radio and you hear a great song, you know it's a great song, and you sing along. We all know what a great song sounds like, so we all have that instinct, it's just being able to accept your own instincts when you write that song.","In the Navy, the path is paved for you. Your job is to be a soldier and fit in. As long as you stick to your place, it's actually really easy.","The moment I wrote my first song, I got addicted.","My sound definitely pays a lot of homage to the Nineties, but not just the dance music. There's also breakbeats, R&B, the big ballads. It's that whole era infused with very modern sounds.","You cannot teach a person how to write songs. It's about being your own person and following your instincts.","I love Canadians. I think we make an impact around the world just when people meet us, and whenever I meet another Canadian, I see it as well.","I probably wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for the gay community supporting me. I wouldn't be the artist I was today if it wasn't for that because that was the only community that let me try, let me perform without knowing who I was.","I didn't date for my entire teen life - it just wasn't on my mind.","To be honest, I'm more of a sneaker person. My legs hurt if I wear heels for too long.","I wear crop tops and stuff, but I genuinely like that style, so it's just has to be genuine. Once you start getting to that world where you're using sexuality to try to propel something, you're losing the moment. You've lost; people are not focusing on that anymore.","I loved the bootcamp and the training. It was the actual Navy and the structure after it that I realized wasn't for me because they're building soldiers. It's a system, and you can't really stick out; you can't be the oddball out in the military.","It's hard to dance to really fast music. All you can do is pump your fist to it, and after a while, you're going to have a seizure.","You're taught that you can keep going in the military. Your point of collapse is not what you thought it was. Your body is built to survive, and when you think you're going to collapse, you still have so much more left in you.","As an artist, I feel so fortunate to be able to learn from all these great musicians that came before me, when some people have nobody that came before them.","From the age of three to 15, I wanted to be a ballerina and trained really, really hard. Then I had that classic movie story moment, where I had an injury and had to give up my dream.","You cannot go wrong by learning classical music because it trains the ear.","Oh man, the Vengaboys are my guilty pleasure.","I was a very unpredictable child. I'd pack a bag and go off and do a hike in the mountains for 10 days.","I was in a rock band; I was my own folk singer; I was in a death metal band for a very short time; I was in a cover band, a jazz band, a blues band. I was in a gospel choir.","I didn't want to be that artist that is successful as a result of someone else. Not that that's wrong, but I felt like I had what it took. I really believed I could do it on my own, so I wanted to try, at least.","People have mentioned, 'Maybe you should try to be more sexy. Look at how this butt stuff propelled this person to the top of the chart; it's amazing!' And I'm like, 'What if I really want to sing something to people?' I speak my mind. I want to be that person people feel they can listen to.","I don't think shoving my butt into people's faces will tell them anything about who I am. How is that connecting to your audience? What is that doing for your music?","It wasn't until I wrote 'Hideaway' that I found the song I related to as an artist.","I like to be creative with my red carpet outfits, but equally, sometimes I am just in the mood to go all out with a ball gown and heels - but only If you get me on the right day!","When I started writing music on the guitar, it started off very folky because of my limited ability to play. It was slow, soft melodies. But then, as I got better on the guitar, I started exploring different sounds.","A lot of people preach and talk, but I think the only way to preach is to actually do things.","When I'm on a plane, I am the annoying person humming into my phone. Sitting there static with nothing to do, a lot of melodies come to me. So I've written a lot of songs on planes.","I was a weird teenager. My mother was actually worried because I didn't have any interest in dating in my teenage years. I had all this desire to pursue my passions like ballet, then sailing, then music, so I didn't have any emptiness to fill."],"Kiiara":["I didn't just work at a hardware store. I went to college for a second, and I worked there on breaks or during the summer.","I just want to be in the studio 24/7. Even if I'm not working on a song right then, just sit in the studio. That's what I love.","It's like, focus on the music. Why do you have to know where I grew up?","I just love making music, and that's my focus.","I want people to be surprised.","I played piano, flute, and guitar.","You don't have to answer someone's questions. That's just how I was raised.","When you're working with a producer, there has to be chemistry.","When I was younger, music was always there.","Writing-wise, I started when I was 17. Whatever was bothering me, I could just write about it in a song. I was in the west suburbs of Chicago, then I moved an hour south, and then I went to school up on the South Side - Saint Xavier, though I was at Purdue for a second before I dropped out.","I was in my friend's apartment, and their buddy called us and was like, 'I'm in a car, and you're on the radio.' So we listened to the song. That was wild. I'm like, 'Is this real? How is this happening?'"],"Kiki Dee":["I look back and wonder why I wasted my time talking about fried potatoes with the great John Lennon. But that's what was so fabulous about him - he was very down to earth.","I always enjoyed sport. I was a bit of a wild child, to be honest, and just loved running around.","Dad always encouraged my singing, so when 'Don't Go Breaking My Heart' was a hit in the States, I flew my parents to New York first-class to see me, put them up at the Waldorf Astoria, then they sailed home on the QE2.","This is where I break one last taboo: I'm incredibly glad I'm not a granny.","My older brother had a lot of Elvis on vinyl, and really, that was my first introduction to music during the Fifties.","I was born Pauline Matthews and grew up in Bradford as one of three children - I had an older brother, David, and an older sister, Betty. My father Fred worked in the mills as a textile weaving supervisor, and my mother, Mary, was a housewife.","I'm a childless woman, yet I felt no maternal urges whatsoever. The prospect of years of broken nights and nappy changes holds no appeal for me.","I realised when I sang at family parties and Christmases I'd suddenly get everyone's attention, and, being the youngest of three, I thought what a brilliant attention-seeking ploy it was.","In my late 30s, I flirted with the idea of having a child without necessarily being in a steady relationship. But I've never had a strong maternal urge, and then I got cancer of the womb - luckily caught at an early stage - so that put paid to that.","Being the youngest, I was a bit of a daddy's girl and sought attention from an early age by singing. I don't know where I got my voice, but ours was always a musical house.","I was never particularly academic, so it was no great surprise when I failed my 11-plus and consequently went to Wibsey Secondary Modern. I did all right in English, history and music, which were the subjects that most interested me.","I found acting tough; it takes a lot out of you if you have no technique.","I was the youngest of three kids, and from the age of four, singing was my way of getting attention.","The first thing Fontana did was get me to change my hair colour from light brown to red, and the songwriter Mitch Murray suggested I change my name from Pauline Matthews to Kiki Dee.","When I started out in this business, I really wanted to become iconic, but I'm glad that didn't happen. I like to do things like travel on public transport unnoticed.","I had a cancer scare in the early '90s, and for a few months, I wondered if I would make it.","I've got my mother's acceptance of things and my dad's drive - not such a bad combination.","I'm just a sensitive little soul who's put so much into her career that I haven't had enough energy or time left over to sustain a relationship.","Performers like to perform, and there's certainly no disgrace in entertaining people, in giving pleasure, you hope, through your singing. My work defines who I am.","I have to keep healthy; otherwise, I jeopardise my career.","It's not so much that I ever declared: 'I will never have children.' I just never found the right man to settle down with, so it didn't happen.","We had idyllic summer holidays, building sandcastles with my father on the beach at Bridlington. It might sound strange, but I think that secure cocoon of familial love was so nourishing, it gave me the strength to live life on my own."],"Kiki Smith":["In our family, there wasn't anything else besides art. Nothing else in the world existed. My father never spoke about going to a movie or listening to music, other than my mother's singing.","I got into animals by drawing hair follicles. I liked drawing hair, and from that I got into feathers and fur, then into images of animals. The patterning is the same, but the proportions of the body change from one animal to the next. A lot of it is just geometry and consciousness.","My iPhone has changed my life - I spend hours taking photos of the sidewalk as I walk down the street. I like the casualness, that it's low-resolution.","You can have fantasies about having control over the world, but I know I can barely control my kitchen sink. That is the grace I'm given. Because when one can control things, one is limited to one's own vision.","I always say I'm Catholic - but a cultural Catholic. I wouldn't say I'm a spiritual person, although I pray every day.","Prior to my father's death, I was having a hard time committing to a career as an artist, but that's not because of who he was - it was because of who I am. It's true, though, that I felt I shouldn't compete with him, and that those feelings went away after he died.","Many people don't have relationships to their siblings in adulthood, or they have superficial ones. It's sort of unfashionable, particularly in America, to be close to your family.","I didn't start to be an artist myself until I was 24.","Artists live in unknown spaces and give themselves over to following something unknown.","As a child I prayed that my calling be revealed - but not with expectation and not with a destination. I became an artist because I didn't know what to do and I thought it was really fun to make things.","I think a lot of making art is listening to yourself.","I like Betsy Ross as a model, too, the quilting bee, sitting around with your friends making art, asking what they think, so that you get the benefit of everyone's opinions and so it's not just about you in your you-dom."],"Killi Krupa Rani":["I actually don't have a view on whether someone watching certain material that may be legal in some places, but might be obscene to somebody else, can trigger a violent streak in someone.","We in the ministry of IT and Communications often get flak for deciding what to ban. We actually never decide something should be banned. We always follow orders from different ministries."],"Kim Alexis":["I'm happy going home early and working out and just being a mother and being a wife.","I feel an important part of beauty is not only what you do on the outside but also what you put into the inside. Good fresh food with many vegetables along with love and caring for others. I spend way more time serving others than I do on my beauty routine daily.","The biggest change for me as a mom was realizing I needed to put someone else before me. Now the hardest part about the empty nest is learning to put myself first.","I have learned to be molded by God into the person He wants. I want to help and encourage others to be the best they can be.","When I was 20, my husband at the time looked at me said, 'You're fat; go run.' There weren't a lot of tools at the end of the '70s to lose weight. It took me a while to realize what kind of exercise would make me happy and I would look forward to doing. And running became it.","A supermodel needed to be able to be on 'Sports Illustrated,' to be able to walk runways, to be able to do beauty ads, to be on covers. And the girls now can no longer be on covers and be in the ads because your actresses have taken over all the jobs. I don't know what happened, but we want our jobs back.","I would rather exercise than read a newspaper.","We are all put in different positions for different reasons.","Don't ever be afraid to step out and do something different.","I think to be a supermodel you first had to be a model, and I think people are jumping and missing that stage.","You have to be a model and multifaceted, but there's not a lot of ways for a model to be multifaceted because the actresses took all the covers.","Modeling is a lonely business... You don't speak. You don't really portray anything but an image... the business is so superfluous about dealing with the outside, it messes with your mind.","I never let myself get desperate.","Modeling is a lonely business.","I'm conservative. I was raised conservative, and that's the way I will vote.","I know that I have raised my sons to be big, strong, independent men who love God, themselves and care for others. I have to learn to let them have space and learn without me.","I did not have a personal relationship with Jesus until I met my nanny, who helped me through a failing marriage and raising my two boys in a New York City apartment. She showed me by example what it was like to be able to talk to Jesus and bring all my cares and worries to Him. That was in 1990.","Running just makes me happy. I love the freedom of running. I ran until I was seven and a half months pregnant with each of my babies. When I gave birth to my first son, my doctor said I couldn't run for six weeks. I was sneaking back out after eight days.","I ran my first marathon in Florida in 1985. I had never run more than nine miles.","I gave birth to my first son in April 1986. I thought it would be a good goal to get back in shape after having a baby if I ran the New York City Marathon. I ran in it November 1986. I had just shot the 'Sports Illustrated' swimsuit issue, so I was in great shape.","I daily disconnect and read a good book or listen to a good sermon or call a friend or my mom and talk on the phone with my feet up. I also take baths with bath salts that I make myself.","Romance is possible between two people at any age! I love feeling young and acting young as I age.","I really discovered I had thyroid disease by accident. My son was having some health concerns, and as I filled out his patient history I noticed I had a lot of similar symptoms. I mentioned it to the doctor, and he ran blood work and finally an ultrasound of my thyroid.","I want people to know that blood tests alone won't always detect thyroid disease. My blood panels were normal. I think a lot more people have this disease than are diagnosed.","I used to waterski on the Niagara River.","I had to learn what made Kim happy. I learned you have to take care of the spark in your eyes.","I look at being older and gaining wisdom. I've learned to stay fit and healthy. I accept my body, my life, and my circumstances.","I was muscular - I was never overweight. But tell a girl that she has to lose 15 pounds when she's not fat, and that has destroyed a lot of who I am over the years, even still. In my mind I'm thinking, 'I'm always too heavy. I should be a skinny thing.'"],"Kim Barnouin":["I have dreams of becoming a professional pastry chef and having a little bakery - that's how much I love baking. I love to cook in general, but my heart lies in desserts.","I am such a sap when it comes to love! I believe in love at first sight all the way. But that's just the way it happened to me with my relationships. I love the idea of two people looking at each other and electricity flying around them; it's so romantic, and it's a great feeling.","I didn't grow up vegan or vegetarian. I grew up with junk food! And because of the way I ate before changing my diet, I can truly understand the challenges of making changes and stepping away from foods that provided a form of comfort and happiness growing up, but finding out that most of what I loved was really bad for me!","I transitioned to being a vegan slowly. I took out beef and chicken first and did research on alternative forms of protein. Then after a few months, I gave up something else but added in new things. You need to bring in new food when you take away the old food you are giving up. Learn about what foods you should be eating."],"Kim Basinger":["I just thank God that I didn't grow up with so much money or privilege because you had to create ways to make it happen.","I'm a very determined businesswoman... I've got lots of things to do, and I don't have time to be classified as difficult, and I don't have time.","I grew up on soul music. I was a dancing little creep.","You lose your anonymity just like a helium balloon with a string. Therefore people are going to have their own opinion and they're going to write in whatever clever manner they desire.","I think any girl who comes to Hollywood with sex symbol or bombshell hanging over her has a rough road.","It always takes the truth a little bit longer to cross the finish line.","I work in a strange business, and 'trust' is a word that's not even in the vocabulary.","I feel there are two people inside me - me and my intuition. If I go against her, she'll screw me every time, and if I follow her, we get along quite nicely.","You have to be a little unreal to be in this business.","There's no doubt that becoming a mother was the greatest thing I'll ever do.","My priorities had been changing before I had Addie but after she was born they changed completely. I don't count - my daughter sort of owns me.","I'm not a real social person - I'm shy - and a lot of the business is just social.","I'm a very determined person.","I remember that Jack Lemmon, who is one of my favorite actors of all time, says that the day he stops being nervous is the day he should leave the business.","I love to be nervous before a scene.","I never really saw my dad as entertained as when he was just completely blown away by somebody on the television screen or at the movies. I think that's the real reason that I went into acting.","I like to see a driven kid: somebody who wants to come from the ground up. I love to see somebody who wants to be the best they can be.","With every project I've ever done, I've always treated it like I'm still in school. Each time you try to go a little further, get a little deeper, feel a little more, sculpt it a little better.","In this business, you can be at the top of the world and at the bottom of the barrel, and you're grape juice. I've been at both ends. It can make you become what you really are.","I just absolutely, totally hated school. It was like a prison to me. I just could not stand that structured, absolute disciplined way of having to deal with life.","I've just always believed you can get anything you want in this life - anything you want.","Clarity keeps you from boredom.","I don't live by a lot of society's rules; I can't pattern myself after the herd.","I'm extremely competitive with myself. But I'm not actively competitive with other women in the business. Which may have been a mistake. I've never had someone in my life, agent or otherwise, fighting for me.","The smartest thing you can do in this business is get connected with a great agent to help you. Get connected with people who will form a family around you, or a moat.","My hand still shakes when I sign autographs. I still go and sit in the movies like everyone else and look up there and go 'God! Movie stars! Wow!' And I'm in this business. I walk out there just fascinated, and I always want to stay like that. I'm just a little kid going to these movies, and I don't ever want to change.","I've been to fights, and I've seen them on television, but no, I would not call myself a fan of the sport, that particular sport, no."],"Kim Campbell":["Since the end of the Second World War, our population has more than doubled to 27 million people.","I'd be prouder still to say I was Canada's 10th woman prime minister.","Canada is the homeland of equality, justice and tolerance.","I believe that Canadians have the common sense to see that a better future cannot be built on fragmentation.","To suggest that Quebecers willingly give up the chance to exercise fully their influence within the federal government would be to betray the historical role Quebec has always played in Confederation, and to undermine the legitimacy of their pride and ambitions.","There is no greater honour than to serve Canadians.","Governments allocate enormous resources for social programs. And it is true that for many years we have had one of the best social service systems in the world. Yet we are still incapable of meeting the needs of tens of thousands of Canadian families.","The world has changed profoundly since our programs were first established.","On the same day I was sworn in as Prime Minister of Canada, I announced the most sweeping reform ever undertaken in the structure of our federal government.","I believe it is time for new leadership that is able to leave the '70s behind.","I know Quebecers don't want to relive old battles; they prefer to build for the future.","Some of you may have been hoping that today I would speak about Lucien Bouchard's latest economic theories. But I have decided to spare him for the time being: after all, he is a man.","For me, unemployment and poverty in the Greater Montreal area is not mainly a problem of structure, or design, or statistics. It is a profoundly human situation.","For over 20 years, the federal and provincial governments have made enormous efforts employing a variety of approaches in an attempt to stimulate Montreal's economy.","In all modesty, we must admit that governments are not always the best doctors when it comes to diagnosing economic ailments and prescribing the right treatment.","Government cannot and must not replace private initiative.","It would be naive to imagine we have solved all our income security problems simply because the roles of the federal and provincial governments in the area of skills training have been clarified.","We have to define and put into practice a better, more coherent and effective policy on income security.","Despite our high rate of unemployment, 300,000 jobs go unfilled largely because many of the unemployed lack the skills needed today as a result of technological progress.","An increasing number of Canadians must juggle the demands of work with the need to care for children, or for family members who are ill or too frail to care for themselves. Our programs have simply not kept pace with these societal changes.","For too many, to work means having less income.","For people on social assistance, the loss of free dental care, prescription drugs and subsidized housing can greatly outweigh additional income from working. We've all heard the stories.","I have always believed governments must adapt to the needs of the people, not the other way around.","Canadians want to see real hope restored, not false hopes raised.","Our first Prime Minister saw a country that would be known for its generosity of spirit. And so it is.","We Canadians are not given as a people to great patriotic displays."],"Kim Carnes":["Acting? No, it is not for me. I would be terrible.","I love to write, to sing, to make music. Not to act: I am horrible.","The European public has always been great to me.","I was gonna write songs, I was gonna be a star and a singer and I never thought of doing anything else.","I write from what's in my heart. I write what I love and have always done that.","Nashville has a great creative atmosphere. It's a small, close-knit music community that you can't find anywhere else."],"Kim Casali":["If you've got love you've got life, if you can love you can live.","Love is... never asking for more than you are prepared to give."],"Kim Cattrall":["I've learned that I can't have a packed work schedule and a packed social schedule and a packed personal life; I need to just have time to myself to sit and breathe and unwind.","What I wear is a reflection of where I am going and how I am feeling. If I'm in a good mood, it's got to be cashmere and jeans - just something comfy, soft and warm. When I'm down, I might find something that I haven't worn for a while that was bought for me - or wear a brooch or a pair of shoes that are like old friends.","Having my priorities in order has really helped me look better, fresher, and more relaxed.","I have a very healthy dose of self-loathing. But I think we all have a past of being whatever our story was, of feeling not good enough. It can propel you to work harder and do more, but it can also be a tremendous trap, and you can't see beyond it.","I take care of myself, which includes dieting, exercising and minimising stress. I joke that I've been on a diet since 1974, which is basically true.","When you're filming, you work 19-hour days, and you know more about what's going on with your crew and co-workers than you do with your husband.","I don't think I'm vain... but I do like to be lit well.","A lot of my life has been lonely. Fantastic, but lonely.","There are many ways to be a mother. I have a lot of young actors I mentor, and my nieces and my nephews need a lot of love.","If I didn't work in television or film, if I didn't have the right look, I never took it personally. Because there was always the theatre. I'm not a nihilist, I'm an optimist. And that has served me well in this profession.","At the beginning of every role I take, I have to start from basics and build it up. It's like a new construction.","I've realized that the most important thing I can do to look good is just treat myself well, whether it's getting a nice, long massage or just lying low and not going out every single night.","Looking good has never been the most important thing to me. Maybe it's because I'm more conventionally, um, acceptable, so it's not an issue for me. I don't know.","I try not to listen to the shoulds or coulds, and try to get beyond expectations, peer pressure, or trying to please - and just listen. I believe all the answers are ultimately within us.","Your dressing area should be your private space.","When you're filming, you work 19-hour days and you know more about what's going on with your crew and co-workers than you do with your husband. You're away, you miss things. It's taxing. Relationships fail because of it.","The older I get, the less jarring I want my exercise to be, and I find that a long walk is equally as helpful and satisfying as a three-mile jog.","Tennessee Williams was so adept at portraying characters who are both fallible and vulnerable. Women were a huge influence in his life, his mother and sister in particular.","There's still the part of me that wants to leap at every opportunity, but now there's the other side that says, 'Let's just wait a minute and see what happens.' That's intuition, and it comes with age and experience.","I did a school play when I was 10 where I played a cold germ infecting a whole classroom of kids. The play was called 'Piffle It's Only a Sniffle.' I'd never had so much fun. It was a thrill.","I never gave up believing that there was much more to life than how I was living it.","Really rejoice in being yourself. Have your own drumbeat.","My family was going back to England to visit my mother's grandmother, who was very ill. We went up to Liverpool and I met my great-aunt, who was just a force of nature. She was an elocution teacher and a huge enthusiast for theater and the classics. I took her amateur acting class, and she was really impressed with me.","I've been playing sexually aware women most of my life. At this point I expected to be playing moms and wives. It's exciting to play a femme fatale.","I think the wonderful thing about doing theater is that it's more of an actor's medium. I think that film is more of a director's medium. You can't edit something out on stage. It's there.","If you stick with a vision, it might not all work, but some of it will be absolute genius. To me, 15 minutes worth of absolute genius in a film is so much better than two hours of mediocrity. I would rather pay to see something different like that.","Art is an expression of who you are. Parts that I play are my sculptures.","I don't read reviews because if they're bad I'm devastated and if they're good I get a big head.","I first wanted to be an actress after seeing a play - not a movie.","I sort of have a love affair with my work. Many of us work far too hard and we don't put enough value in the epicurean, sensual part of life.","I'm certainly not a prude.","I've always thought that less was a lot more.","My experiences in film and theatre in the States have been much more rigorous-in England there's an environment of, Let's try this.","Since doing the show I've been so busy that I've not really had time to mope.","That's what life is - you follow where your heart leads you - at least I do.","The first professional play I ever saw was The Importance Of Being Earnest, and I just fell in love.","The roles for women in theatre are much better than they are in film.","Theatre can't be done again and again and again and again - it's organic.","I'm a trisexual. I'll try anything once.","Practically all the relationships I know are based on a foundation of lies and mutually accepted delusion.","I like movies I can relate to.","I prefer younger men. In some ways, they are much more open to a woman being stronger and independent then some of the men my age.","I am no size zero or super-thin Hollywood actress. I am built for men who like women to look like women.","Talented people are written off once they hit their 50s and 60s, and the saddest thing is, we just get better as we get older.","Being a biological mother just isn't part of my experience this time around. However, I am a mother who continues to give birth to ideas and ways of experiencing life that challenge the norm.","When I feel lost and can't make a decision, I just stop and get quiet. I take a time-out.","I always assumed that like my mother before me, one day I would have children.","My curiosity and my appetite for evolving as an actor is one of the main components of me still working today in the business.","I'm not a personality actress. I never have been. I have been a character actress.","My film career was always to support my theater career.","There's a positive side to film and television, the sense of feeding into the theater... Your fans will follow you, hopefully, and be open-minded to see you play other things and experience other stories you want to tell.","I'm so lucky to have a career in my fifties. And to still have the desire to do it. I don't think about retirement.","I like my life. It's good.","I'm smart with my money, I invest conservatively. I don't mind paying top-dollar, but I don't want to get ripped off.","I haven't played a lot of wallflowers but I have played women who have been vulnerable.","When I got out of my Twenties I stopped playing women that were victims. I like playing women who are strong and have a piece of mind.","I had a great time in my youth and I still feel youthful. I've no desire to look as though I'm in my 20s.","I don't know many women who can relate to Sharon Stone and the kind of movies she does. I don't know a lot of guys who can relate to Tom Cruise's movies because they're on a kind of fantastic level.","Theatre is immediate, it's alive, you're there with the audience, it can't be done again and again and again and again, it's organic.","Being a gossip reporter just isn't a respectable job. It'll chew you up and spit you out.","In my life and career I want to embrace ageing because I think that's what's interesting.","You have to be desirable. And that's why so many woman of my age or even younger are pushed to Botox and plastic surgery, all the things that people say, 'Why do women do this?' Where do you go in your 50s in your career?","It's your body, your life. Do what you want to do.","I don't know many women who can relate to Sharon Stone and the kind of movies she does. I don't know a lot of guys who can relate to Tom Cruise's movies because they're on a kind of fantastic level. I like movies I can relate to.","I've seen some women who are not particularly attractive but they have an assurance, and there's something so attractive about someone who doesn't have to work so hard.","When I see a woman who looks her age, she's radiating something, and it's life.","There's a look people get in their eyes when you're talking to them and they're not seeing you, and you know it's because they have a movie running through their head.","I didn't want to get married, and I didn't want kids - I knew I wanted to act.","I have a big appetite, and staying on top of that is about knowing myself and saying, 'I can eat that today, but tomorrow I'm not going to.'","If my accomplishments frighten someone, it's nothing to do with me - that's to do with them. But the men who are in my life see me as a person - as a woman - not as a character I've played.","I was very close to my father. At the age of ten I wanted to do plays, and my father was very encouraging. When I applied to different acting schools, he was right there and very supportive.","I like to step outside of what people's idea of me might be. I suppose that makes me a bit of a rule-breaker. I like to take chances.","It's easy to diet or get off a diet when you've got a juicy role to play.","I feel sometimes and in some ways like Linda Romanoli and Monica Velour; I feel marginalized because I'm in my fifties. If you went online and you look at some of the blogs, which one can do on a lonely night, it's pretty startling what people will say about you just because you're in your fifties.","If I'm producing, I'm not acting, and it's such a long road to get anything off the ground.","I don't want to be in boardrooms talking about hiring hairdressers and minivans. I'm not good at it, and I don't like to hire and fire people. I hate that. It's horrible.","I always assumed that, like my mother before me, one day I would have children. When I was 5, my fantasy was to have a hundred dogs and a hundred kids.","I follow life's changes, continue with my time-outs, and remain curious about what's next.","I wanted to understand pain and the human condition, which is full of pain and regret and sadness - and some happiness, if you're lucky.","It was difficult when I was very young because I was so separated from my family. When I was at school or acting in a play, I felt very much part of something, and then it would always change, and I would be by myself.","I've been dieting my whole life because I have a tremendous appetite.","I am not interested in being a Barbie doll and turning myself into a sausage for the next 20 years. I want to follow actresses like Helen Mirren and Judi Dench who have lines on their faces and aren't afraid of playing their age.","What would be really difficult is to be sitting on a beach. There's vacations, and there's vegetations. I don't do well vegetating.","I was a bit odd as a kid, because there were so little outlets for me. There was no theatre except for the odd community theatre and school shows. The only movie theatre was at the Canadian Forces Base nearby in Comox, so it either showed kiddie flicks for the families and restricted stuff for the men.","I enjoyed making people laugh. I discovered that I loved that power over them. On stage, I felt I could really express who I was for the first time.","I consider myself a feminist living in a post-feminist era.","Shows like 'Sex and the City' got women involved again in a political way. They were drawn into the personal stories of the four women who together make up one complete cosmopolitan woman. We want to have community, and the show filled that void in our lives: friendship between women.","I'm not expecting much work in Hollywood, to be honest. People stick to film because they tend to get offered the same roles over and over again, and it's safe. But I'm not interested in doing that.","If I only did theatre I would have had to waitress, and I didn't want to waitress.","I'm a single woman of 56 and I see a lot of men my age with much younger women or women my age with much younger men. I've done both, and I still hope that when I do find someone I want to spend time with, they think I'm the hottest thing going.","Most people look at ageing as a disease. They do. They have prescriptions and places where you go to eradicate it.","I'm drawn to roles because they excite me intellectually and emotionally.","I got to L.A., and they said I had to lose weight, let my hair grow and buy some dresses. I was nailing auditions with my readings, but they wouldn't hire me because I wasn't putting on the glam. It just didn't occur to me.","Most of your life as an actor in Hollywood, either an actress or an actor, you have to look - you have to work out, you have to look - you rarely get to play someone who's just human, who's real, who is overweight, even not grossly overweight, but who has aspects of just everyday life.","A pilot is like the most extensive dress rehearsal you can ever imagine, because the writers are learning about the actors, the actors are learning about the characters.","You know within three seconds if you're going to have a history with someone - it's a long half-hour if you've got it wrong.","I don't really watch television, and I don't watch these shows that promote shows.","I found a lot of guys my age and older were absolutely terrified of me. Younger men weren't.","Once you have a child, that becomes your life, and while that's the way it should be, I sort of have a love affair with my work. Having said that, many of us work far too hard and we don't put enough value in the epicurean, sensual part of life.","There is no need to feel defeated at 40, 50 or 60. I'm having the greatest time in the second half of my life.","Have you seen some of the women - and the men - in Los Angeles? They pay surgeons to make them look completely different in the hope of finding their youth. But youth comes from within. If you have a young attitude, then that can show in your face, the way you walk and move.","A successful television series can chain you to a schedule of long hours and can put your personal life on hold. But after it is all over, if you survive, then anything is possible.","I actually think 'Sex and the City' helped share how complicated it all is, to be a wife, a mother, and working, and a sexual being.","I don't speak to my brother every week - doesn't mean I don't love him.","I'm a good businessman. I pay my bills. Growing up in a situation where everything counted helps.","I don't express a lot of things that I feel; I kind of register things.","The most difficult thing about my job is that I do a lot of 19-hour days. It's really difficult to have a life, never mind a relationship. I don't have any regrets, really. I'm quite content. I'm very stubborn and persistent. I just keep working.","As I get older, I find that cardio is less important to me. What I want to do more of is intense stretching.","I feel so much at home onstage and so comfortable in my body.","I feel I disappoint people when I am not 'Samantha.' They seem surprised when I don't have the same voice and the same mannerisms. They were booking 'Samantha,' and I would show up.","Someone recently asked what I am most proud of. The thing I'm most proud of is that I'm in my 50s and I'm still a leading lady."],"Kim Clijsters":["There have been many moments over the last year when I thought it was all over.","These were the moments when I was disappointed and frustrated, when I got so low because it seemed all my hard work had been wasted. But the moments passed, and the motivation to go back to rehab was there again.","I know that I'm going to have to work hard, keep working hard, and not because of this victory think, 'I'm back.' I don't think like that. I'll definitely work hard. Things are not going to be easy. I might lose first round next week. You never know.","I've worked really hard, but it's definitely not been easy.","All my time in rehab has made me appreciate tennis more than ever.","I said in my mind, 'keep fighting.'","I have a daughter and a family.","We have a tough schedule this summer, so I have to plan my schedule wisely if I want to be able to last throughout the season.","I am happy to have played a match and break the rhythm of daily training.","So far, and today, everything felt really great. Now I am good to get on the plane and fly to Australia.","It's been a year of many more downs than ups.","Physically, I feel extremely well, perhaps fitter than ever.","Obviously I'm very disappointed. I trained very hard this summer and felt in a good shape to play the U.S. Open.","People get so stressed and nervous and mad.","I've been practicing for a while now and physically trying to get in better shape as well after the injuries.","I'm happy I was able to stick through it and was being very disciplined with what I had to do, because I know eventually hard work will pay off. It's only a matter of now just trying to make sure I get matches under my belt and I feel more and more comfortable playing matches.","It makes you also realize, 'OK, I'm excited to play tennis, and I work really hard to be the best tennis player I think I can be,' but I don't waste my time on stupid stuff, you know what I mean.","I would love to do well one last time in Melbourne and my dream would be to win Wimbledon and play in the London Olympics.","When I was younger I used to be devastated if I would lose."],"Kim Coates":["I'm so not scary. I'm a pussycat. But what are you going to do, right? I mean, these cheekbones, and I guess these eyes, and the big nose... this is what my momma and my poppa gave to me, and that's the deal.","When I decided to go to university I didn't know what I wanted to do. When I had an opportunity to take an elective I took Drama by chance, even though I'd never taken a Drama course or even been in a play in high school. Two years later I was majoring in Drama and I knew I wanted to be an actor.","See, what I don't like listening to is when writers go, 'And then the person cries.' 'Or the person does this.' It's there, but it's not the Bible. I wait and see what happens to me on the day.","I barely leave my cage, my house.","I know people have tattooed my 'Sons of Anarchy' photos, they've painted them, on their bikes. I've seen a few of those, sent to me through friends, where they've actually taken my 8x10 Tig photo and put it right on their bike.","It's not like I don't want to play the guy next door. But sometimes they're not the best written or the most complicated. But I am very, very particular about my bad boys. There are certain types of characters I will not play. I've said no so many times to so many parts that are just way too dark. You have to be careful."],"Kim Collins":["Strive for continuous improvement, instead of perfection.","This is my future and I will take personal responsibility for making sure all competition requirements are met.","Whenever the competition is sleeping is when I shine.","If the IAAF feel that is the right way to go for TV rights and everything, the rule will stay. As much as I want to be on the podium, tonight is a sad night for athletics.","I would like to thank the Commonwealth Games Federation for the very fair manner in which this matter has been dealt with."],"Kim Dae Jung":["Unification is one thing, and stability in Northeast Asia is another thing.","Unification is not our present goal. That is a future program.","And also, we are providing, you know, a nuclear power plant in the north, two light water systems, so some 4 or 5 billion dollars we are providing to meet with North Korean requests on the condition North Korea will not produce a nuclear weapon.","American presence is, you know, the major cause of balance of power and the stability in this region.","Well, that is very imperative to let North Korea open door to outside.","You know, North Korea situation is far worse than East Germany, and South Korea is weaker than West Germany.","So South Korean ability is very much limited to handle North Korean, you know, difficulties. So we don't want to see an immediate collapse of the North Korea regime.","There is some sign that North Korea is changing recently. There is ongoing successful negotiation to have a military talk to Pyongyang, which has been stopped for seven years.","So such an American troops presence in Korea in the South and Japan, total some 100,000 should stay there forever, even after unification of Korean peninsula.","So in Asia I want to make - I want to succeed to make a model of what success, practicing democracy, and market economy. Then that will give a good influence over Asian countries.","So for mutual interest, I do want American presence in this region.","If America would withdraw from South Korea, there could be a power struggle between such as China and Japan.","I think a major cause of present Asian economic difficulties that mainly come from, you know, lack of market economy.","But such IMF pressure is very much helpful for me to push such a, you know, reform. So in this sense I think IMF is very much helpful for alien society.","To realize peace on the Korean peninsula, and to develop exchange, cooperation between both Koreas, they are the, you know, immediate target of our government.","So now we are pushing economic reform, bank reform and enterprise reform. So we can finish that reform this year, in September or October. Then our economy may be much more, you know, normalized.","So moderate is insisting that North Korea should open door to outside.","So if North Korea continues present isolation, then with such economic difficulties the North Korean government must meet a very serious situation in the future."],"Kim Deal":["To my mind, there is a reason that music is there and it's about being human.","I thought I'd do everything on four-track, and then I'll record every instrument myself in a studio, and then I'll have a solo album released by spring.","I like the club. It looks nice with all the tables out. They were freaking out, the Gilly's people.","Bob summed it up best when he was on his knees at the end of the night saying, 'Don't trust in Guided By Voices.' You were there; was the show awful or something? I know it was sloppy, but they're not really that tight anyway, but was it embarrassing, was it sad?","It's like they had a backlash the first 11 years. I think the reason why it always seems like there's a backlash is because when bands are unknown, they only get written about by fans.","When the band begins to get a name for themselves, and the writers get assigned to bands, they'll hit somebody who just doesn't like that kind of music, or they love hip hop but hate guitar rock.","We were over in Europe all the time their posters were up. That's why I liked them. So now all of a sudden they're going to get a band hat on, and say people aren't acting the right way?","You know it has to do with Kelley and drugs, and me... and there's like, what is it? I didn't read it. That's my thing. That's what I do, I don't read things if I don't think they're going to be good. I don't even look at the pictures.","It was really weird to have a hit. Of course, we had a certain level of fame in the Pixies, but nothing I had ever done had been mall-kid friendly.","Maybe I'm an elitist, but I don't feel like I am."],"Kim Delaney":["Women have to air it out, hold on to it, work on it.","Everything is really good and I'm blessed.","I would say I have compassion.","I'm single. I had to make a few changes in my life.","I always work out. I do Pilates and yoga.","I know how guys talk, so I'm not easily offended. Guys can fight and be best friends five minutes later. Women have to air it out, hold on to it, work on it."],"Kim Dickens":["Pilot season tends to be grueling, because you can be thrown all of these auditions at once - last-minute, always - and you're going on three a day, especially back in the day.","I love football movies.","I started out in New York, and New York has a way of countering a Southern accent, naturally; when I moved to Los Angeles for a job, and I just stayed, the dialect out here doesn't really counter, and my Southern started coming back.","When you're guest-starring on another show, it really requires you to jump through hoops in a way, because you're servicing the stories of the main characters. You have to be able to portray a lot of different elements. You show up and get on board and get on their journey; you have to be flexible as to what they need for the role.","I'm a country girl; I like country music. That's what my car radio is on.","I have to say, not a day goes by when I don't think fondly about 'Deadwood' and miss things about it.","I was a waitress years ago when I was first trying to become an actress, waiting tables in New York City.","Steve Zahn and I like to go to dinner, and we love to go to Chef Donald Link's Herb Saint.","I like country music. I'm not going to lie. I'm from the South, and I grew up on it. My dad was a country singer-songwriter, so it's in my blood, and I love it.","I don't like all of the contemporary country. I like some of it, but I'm mostly into the traditional style.","If you went to school in Nashville, you were aware of all those '60s rockabilly people.","I wish I was more of a song-and-dance girl. I sang in a show once. I wish I could be in 'Hair.'"],"Kim Dotcom":["If you create something, you don't want someone else to go and profit from it; you have your right to make a living and everything. So I respect copyright. What I don't respect is copyright extremism. And I what I don't respect is a business model that encourages piracy.","Always upbeat, always happy, always putting you in a good mood. That's what I want to achieve with my music.","I have a huge ego - I know that. Do I worry about it? No, I think it's cool. I have a lot of fun.","I think copyright has its right to exist, absolutely, and I think that it's up to copyright creators to come up with new solutions that deal with the reality of the world we're living in today.","When you create something that is popular, when you create a solution, you're an innovator, and you solve problems for people and they like what you have to offer, of course you automatically make money.","The U.S. government is saying that my website enabled piracy when the entire Internet is enabling piracy. Every ISP that connects people to the Internet is enabling piracy - Google is, YouTube is, everybody is.","I prefer being able to choose who I want to help or what I want to improve in the world by making a lot of money myself rather than just going out there and talking about things. If you have money to do things, it's much better than just talking about them.","I love driving fast. I grew up in Germany; we have the Autobahn here, where we can drive without a speed limit. And throughout my 20s, I always had fast cars, and I always went to the maximum. Like, my average cruising speed was 250 km/hr.","The Internet is this whole new world that allows everyone to communicate and exchange information and be a perfect marketplace and just accelerate everybody's lives. So, for me, the Internet was the greatest invention of mankind so far.","Megaupload was a dual-use technology. You can use it for good things, and you can use it for bad things. If someone sends something illegal in an envelope through your postal service, you don't shut down the post office. If someone speeds with the car he just bought, you don't go to the car manufacturer and say, 'Hey, we're shutting you down.'","The Internet is all about accessing entertainment. Realistically, 50 to 80 percent of all traffic is people downloading stuff for free. If you can turn that huge market share into something that you can monetize, even if it is just with ads, you will end up making more money than with all other revenue streams combined.","If you look at history, and if you look at all these different things that have threatened the movie industry - from Betamax tape to DVDs to the Internet - in the end, it has always turned out right, because ultimately people want to see that stuff.","The Internet is by the people, for the people.","It's the big boys, the Googles of this world, that are already benefiting from piracy and not paying the artists a dime.","I'm not a pirate. I'm an innovator.","Because of my flamboyant lifestyle, because of me being German, the way I am, I am the easiest person to sell as a villain. I'm the perfect target.","The U.S. obviously has all the evidence they need to prosecute bankers. They just need to search their own spy database and then there you go - 1,000 bankers in jail, a trillion dollars in fines. But it doesn't happen. Instead, the spy network is being used to fight a copyright case. They used Prism to spy on me.","I'm a businessman, and I think there's nothing wrong with being a businessman provided you have the right headspace and do good things with the money you make.","I would love nothing more than me and my family getting green cards, going to L.A. for a year, sitting down with the big Hollywood studios and coming up with the most advanced and awesome Internet distribution platform for movies. It would make Hollywood more money than cinemas, DVDs, and everything else combined.","Megaupload is not responsible for the piracy problem. It's the old business model of Hollywood that is responsible for it, and they want to keep that model alive at any cost.","I might be one of the most flamboyant characters New Zealand has ever seen, but my intentions are good, and I would like to see New Zealand flourish.","I was an online service provider. It's not my job to police what people are uploading. It's the job of the content owners, and the law is very clear. If you create content, and you want to protect your copyrights, you have to do the work.","Hollywood is in control of politics and has imported their action-filled movie scripts into the real world.","I always thought of myself as more American than Americans when I was living in Germany, because I always had this attitude of can-do, and if you're successful, you can show it, which is a very un-German thing, you know.","It's things like Wikipedia that help us to advance as a society and help us to accelerate our evolution. If you're a researcher and you need some answer to something, and in today's world you can find it this quickly, it allows you to develop whatever you are doing much faster.","I'm a fun-loving guy. I enjoy my life. I have a big kid inside me.","I used to respect the United States and the American dream. Now I consider the United States the biggest threat to Internet freedom and peace in the world.","The war for the Internet has begun. Hollywood is in control of politics. The government is killing innovation.","I get 100 e-mails a day from Americans who say, 'What you're doing is cool - can we work for you?' From Germans, I also get 100 e-mails a day, saying, 'You fat pig!' or 'You're a liar and a criminal!' I'm trying to change this.","My idea is that artists should make their music available for free, and fans should only pay for it if they really like it.","The very powerful and the very stupid have one thing in common. Instead of changing their views to fit the facts, they try to change the facts to fit their views.","Providing 'freemium' cloud storage to society is not a crime. What will Hollywood do when smartphones and tablets can wirelessly transfer a movie file within milliseconds?","Come on, guys, I am a computer nerd. I love Hollywood and movies. My whole life is like a movie. I wouldn't be who I am if it wasn't for the mind-altering glimpse at the future in 'Star Wars.'"],"Kim Edwards":["Though Lexington is not a small town, it sometimes feels like one, with circles of acquaintance overlapping once, then again; the person you meet by chance at the library or the pool may turn out to be the best friend of your down-the-street neighbor. Maybe that's why people are so friendly here, so willing to be unhurried.","It's impossible to control the reception of your work - the only thing you can control is the experience of writing itself, and the work you create.","As a writer and as a reader, I really believe in the power of narrative to allow us ways to experience life beyond our own, ways to reflect on things that have happened to us and a chance to engage with the world in ways that transcend time and gender and all sorts of things.","You don't want to engage in road rage when the person in the next car might be your child's future teacher or your dentist's father.","I find my husband's family history fascinating, as they can trace the family lineage back to ancestors who fought, and died, in the first battle of the Revolution, as well as to many other interesting people.","My first job was in a nursing home - a terrible place in retrospect. It was in an old house, and the residents were so lonely. People rarely visited them. I only stayed there a couple of months, but it made a strong impression on me.","One of my greatest times of inspiration is when I'm traveling or living in a new country - there's a tremendous freedom that comes from being unfettered by your own, familiar culture, and by seeing the world from a different point of view.","I love to swim, and I love being near water.","Many Lexington natives believe they live in a special place, one impossible to leave. I'm not so sure about that - or it's more accurate to say I think a more general truth exists beneath it: the place you first call home stays with you always, whether you remain or go.","William Trevor is an author I admire; his stories are subtle and powerful, and beautifully written.","I've always set my stories in places I know well. It frees me up to spend more imaginative time on the characters if I'm not worrying about the logistics.","I never know as a writer when I set out into a novel where it's going to take me.","The way we behave, our views and outlooks really have their sources some place. They come from somewhere. Sometimes we don't even know what they are, and yet they're very powerful in our lives.","I don't think we'll ever lose the desire for people to tell stories or to hear stories or to be entrapped in a beautiful story.","You don't know when you are immersed in a book what the reaction to it will be, but I feel great about 'The Lake of Dreams.'","We all have secrets. We've all kept secrets. We've had secrets kept from us, and we know how that feels.","After 'Memory Keeper's Daughter,' it took me a few months to shut out the world. I really had to turn off the Internet and sort of cloister myself away from the world again and sink into that psychic space to write again.","I love 'Memory Keeper's Daughter,' but in some ways I think 'The Lake of Dreams' is a stronger book. I was able to tell the story I wanted to tell. That's all you can ever do as a writer. From there on you have no control over it.","Though my stories aren't autobiographical, I do sometimes use things from my life.","It's kind of a mysterious process, but something will catch my attention, and I'll make a note about it. I may even write a few pages about it, and then I'll put it aside, but I'll sort of keep it in mind. Then as time goes on, other things will gather to it as if it's a magnet, almost, and eventually, there's enough to make the story.","I think that it would be hard to find a family that didn't have a secret in it somewhere, and sometimes we know about them, sometimes we don't. Sometimes we have an inkling that there's something hidden, but I think that it touches everybody's life.","I always talk to my students about the need to write for the joy of writing. I try to sort of disaggregate the acclaim from the act of writing.","I had a great life even before 'The Memory Keeper's Daughter' took off. I really enjoy teaching.","'The Lake of Dreams' grew gradually, over many years, elements and ideas accruing until they gained enough critical mass to become a novel.","I lived for two years in Odawara, a castle town an hour outside of Tokyo, near the sea. It's a beautiful place, and I drew on my experiences there when writing 'The Lake of Dreams.'","I haven't done any genealogical exploring myself, though members of my family and also of my husband's family have traced things back. I have a great grandfather on my mother's side who was a musician, and I'd like to know more about his life.","There was a sense that there was a lot of word of mouth happening with 'The Memory Keeper's Daughter,' even in hardcover.","I hadn't really thought about this until 'The Lake of Dreams,' but I've set all my stories in places that are familiar to me. It frees me up to spend more imaginative time on the characters.","The secret at the heart of 'The Memory Keeper's Daughter' is something everybody, except for some of the characters, knows in Chapter 1. Some of the narrative tension comes from that distance between what the readers know and what the characters know.","I like to think I've grown as a writer and taken some risks, but I still consider myself to be a literary writer.","Lexington is home to the University of Kentucky, where my husband and I teach, as well as to Transylvania University, the oldest college established west of the Allegheny Mountains, and several multinational companies; people come and go from all over the world.","I grew up in Skaneateles, a small town in New York's Finger Lakes region, where parts of my family have lived for five generations. I can walk the streets there and point out my father's childhood home, the houses my grandfather built, the farm where my great-great-uncle worked after he emigrated from England in the 1880s.","Your understanding of a place changes the longer you stay; you discover more, and your own life gets woven into the fabric of the community.","'Middlesex' by Jeffrey Eugenides left me both moved and, at times, laughing out loud in delight.","In writing, I want to be remembered for telling good stories in beautiful and powerful language, using the poetry of words to reflect the thematic concerns of compelling stories.","I swam across Skaneateles Lake, about a mile, when I was 11 years old. I remember feeling when I was in the middle of the lake that I would be there forever, and having no idea where on shore I'd end up. I made it, and I'm proud of the determination and persistence that took.","I like clothes that are elegant and comfortable."],"Kim Elizabeth":["My imagination completely controls me, and forever feeds the fire that burns with dark red light in my heart by bringing me the best dreams. I've always had a wild imagination, a big heart and a tortured soul so I feel that dark fantasy, love and horror are in my blood.","We will all, someday, experience death, and become obsolete as a dead leaf falling from a tree, crushed by passersby to ashes underlying the earth.","It is normal for me to wake and find myself writing in the dark... or to be out of my tomb, caught in an unearthly world, alive with the images that haunt me.","My writing, like everything I do, comes profoundly from my heart. I believe that if you follow your heart you will be successful in one way or another. Old-fashioned as that might sound, the philosophy is true.","I am the epitome of a walking contradiction for various reasons, only one of which being that I feel my existence is of heaven and hell.","Nothing is more dreadful in life than the profound thought that death may only greet you with eternal nothingness.","I've always found it easy and natural and, more importantly, necessary to articulate thoughts and feelings, and fierce emotions, through the written word. Fantasy and horror came to me when I was very young.","When I write I simply follow my heart. And my flights of fantasy. It is not done with a conscious effort. I'm continually inspired and write reflexively.","I appreciate all of the attention I get in my career. I am a loner and live a rather secluded life so sometimes I do get overwhelmed, but I am always very appreciative of everything, and honored."],"Kim Fields":["Balance is so important. We all have to cut up our clock to find out what works for you. If you're ineffective, you're using bad clock management, and you have to adjust. Using a basketball reference, the team who wins is the team that can make adjustments in real time.","Gospel music to me has always been a balm for the soul. It has been able to usher in the spirit, usher in worship, true worship and praise, healing. I find the music to be very good at healing and the passion, you know, which is a testimony being told in song.","I hold onto the Scripture that says, 'Be anxious for nothing, but in all things give thanks.' I'm not saying I don't have problems or that I don't worry, but I try not to be stressed. I manage my anxiety through prayer. Worry shows up on your face, and I don't want that!","I love the fact that Atlanta has given the entertainment industry an additional and growing hub. The opportunities personally and professionally have been a wonderful blessing.","Acting is my first love. There are still so many characters inside of me that are waiting to come out.","Working with Will Smith was one of the highlights of my career. He is so talented and has a tremendous work ethic. We are still friends, and I reach out to him and his partner to pitch ideas. He loves my mother. In fact, my mother was his son Jaden's acting coach for the movie 'Pursuit of Happiness.'","I don't feel that I was often compartmentalized as an African-American actor, yet I am fully aware of the plight that actors, directors and producers of color face in our industry. I choose to focus on being proactive in creating opportunities for myself and others while acknowledging that we are not playing on a level playing field.","I will encourage my kids in everything that life has to offer.","I give and give, and sometimes I can't find me. I'm sure many moms and wives go down that same rabbit hole.","Being a mom is really the greatest role in my life.","It's funny how God will just keep using you, and our motto around our family forever has been, 'Just let Him use you.'","I've been very blessed as far as my faith sustaining me because it's not like I haven't been challenged and I haven't been tested and disappointed. But my faith does really bind me and keep me.","We did a reunion when TV One first launched episodes of 'Living Single'. Every time any of the gang comes through Atlanta, though, we always visit.","I have an amazing husband who is a strong man of God. He is very dedicated to me and our family.","Lord knows I'm not the poster child for eating right and exercising, so I don't want to give that impression at all! This is the same person who people have watched have a weight problem in her teens, so come on!","Directing at seven-and-a-half months pregnant was lots of fun.","God-willing and prayerfully, we are always growing and changing and developing personally and professionally.","Family is very important to me. People often ask me how I managed to stay grounded and sane, having started as a child star and growing up in the industry, and really, it's God. But it's also my family and God in my family.","I recognize that every role I play, I'm not going to play someone that has a ministry or that is a Christian, and I don't think that's what God has called me to do. The gift and talent that He's given me as an actor, director, producer is to entertain, sometimes to inform, most times to inspire.","I was always very maternal with my friends. I wasn't the kind of little girl that played with dolls and pretended I was the mommy. I wasn't that child, so when I say I was always maternal, I don't mean in that sense - but I've always been a nurturer.","I think my issues with the Internet surround people who become 'overnight celebrities.' It's like, really? You put something on YouTube, and they Auto-Tuned it, and now you're a star, and you have a TV show, and you have a record deal.","I keep in touch with a lot of people I work with.","I've been asked for years to do a reality show. One of my criteria is that I would be given the opportunity to show a strong family unit.","There has been a tremendous growth in the entertainment industry throughout Atlanta. There are many opportunities in film, television and theatre.","My husband's name is Christopher Morgan, and we met in Atlanta. My two children are Sebastian and Quincy.","The first choice for me is what's going to make me stretch out in my craft?","It's a blessing to be a part of television shows that were, to a certain extent, staples in a lot of people's lives and as far as their entertainment lives.","I'm not just considered a former child star. I'm not considered a black actress. I'm not considered an actress. I've done roles that were written for men. First and foremost is God: I definitely believe in Him having kind of mapped out what my destiny was going to be.","As a director, I love being able to really be a contributing factor to the overall vision of a project.","I really enjoy theater. Performing live onstage is helping me to grow as an actress.","I miss my 'Facts of Life' family. But I had been preparing myself to leave the show for some time before we called it quits.","While I'm a New Yorker at heart, and 'Harlem Honey' runs through my veins, Atlanta - its awesome residents and glorious landscapes - has a special place in the hearts of my family and I.","I was never pushed into the industry. I was a very shy child. I was not one to perform for friends and family at every get-together.","I always felt that I had a childhood. I went to regular school whenever I wasn't working. At one point, I wanted to be a marine biologist.","'Facts of Life' was and continues to be a milestone on my journey. But when people act like the journey ended when 'Facts of Life' ended, that's annoying. I could never and would never want to divorce myself from it because it was such a great experience from so many different facets.","I recognize the unknowing, involuntary effect that 'Facts of Life' had and continues to have on several generations of people."],"Kim Gordon":["No one talks about woman power. The Spice Girls - they're masquerading as little girls. It's repulsive.","I feel most free onstage. The audience, it's an abstraction. You don't really see anyone out there, but you feel the audience inside you.","It's amazing how many things you can do when you're just pretending.","I never really thought of myself as a musician. I'm not saying Sonic Youth was a conceptual-art project for me, but in a way, it was an extension of Warhol. Instead of making criticism about popular culture, as a lot of artists do, I worked within it to do something.","Women make natural anarchists and revolutionaries because they've always been second-class citizens, kinda having had to claw their way up. I mean, who made up all the rules in the culture? Men - white male corporate society. So why wouldn't a woman want to rebel against that?","I like the adrenaline of playing improv - it makes me feel really calm.","You're always going to feel like you're catching up, and part of that is just balancing work and motherhood and the whole feeling of needing to please, which I do think girls and women feel more than men.","I try not to think too much about what the audience is thinking and what they think I should do. I'd be self-conscious if I did. Anyone becomes mannered if you think too much about what other people think.","Rap music is really good when you're traumatized.","In rock music, people have certain assumptions that it makes people more enlightened, and it really doesn't.","In a lot of the art world, you have to present yourself as you know what you're doing at a young age. Music gave me another outlet. The 'no wave' bands were such an inspiration; it felt so free - once you start doing it, it's hard to stop. But I can't get away from art. It comes back around. I wouldn't be true to myself if I didn't pursue it.","I still don't really feel like a bass player.","A friend of mine introduced me to Thurston Moore because she thought I would like him. He was playing with the tallest band in the world, the Coachmen. They were sort of like Talking Heads, jangly guitar, Feelies guitar. Anyway, it was love at first sight. His band broke up that night. And we started playing.","In the early eighties, there were a lot of artists involved with the music scene. All those young artists, before their careers took off, were into music. Robert Longo used to play some guitar. He had a band for a while. Basquiat had a band. I mean, people were always trying to mix music and art - in fact, I'm guilty of it myself.","There's only so many small shows you can do. A lot of the smaller things are more side project things. Not everything is appropriate for Sonic Youth to do.","I've never been good with structure - doing assignments for the sake of them or doing things I'm supposed to do.","I'm a slow learner. When people are so talented or facile at picking up an instrument and playing covers, like Yo La Tengo, I admire that. But I could never do that.","I'm a relatively shy person, but I love being challenged and putting myself in positions that are scary.","I was very aware of performers who have a persona, whether it's Siouxsie Sioux or Patti Smith or Lydia Lunch, and I'm just this middle-class girl coming from a more conventional upbringing, this California person. But in a way I felt like it's important to represent the normal.","And then, I was thinking of doing a record just like starting with voice, because I did this one song that was just kind of a cappella, and I did it for this art piece I did where people could come and play music to go with a voice.","Anyone becomes mannered if you think too much about what other people think.","Because our daughters have school and it's just such a hassle going down to New York all the time, we can really only go on the weekends, we kind of... Steve came up here and worked out stuff for the second half of the record.","But everything has been so gradual that it's sort of all come from, just hard work and basically being at it.","I have a really hard time writing my own lyrics for this record, because one, I had to write so many and also I was kind of perplexed by the idea of how I was going to sing and play... because at that time, we hadn't really thought about asking someone else.","I just happened to start playing music for the conceptual ideas.","I just think that playing bass, like punk rock bass with a pick, wasn't meant to be done for 25 years.","I mean, I don't even think of myself as a musician, really.","I mean, most of it is probably more obscure and just more noisy than either of those two bands, but Thurston has stuff all the time that he's involved with that is fairly obscure and experimental.","I see it as more of a teenage activity than, you know, she's only 11, but you know, I think it's great that she knows so many girls who want to play music. And I see it more as a teen activity than I do as going into music.","I try not to think too much about what the audience is thinking and what they think I should do.","It's really hard for me to sing and play bass.","The last two records I liked playing a lot.","Unless you're singing something that's kind of in rhythm with the bass, the melodies, it's just difficult.","Well, it was kind of accidental that Jim started playing with us, although it wasn't sudden... we hadn't really looked around to think who could be a fifth member.","You know, we have our own audience, and it's not like - they just know we're not going to do certain things.","I grew up listening to John Coltrane and jazz, so they were subtle influences. I sometimes think about doing some kind of weird jazz record, but I don't know... It's on my list of things to do. I don't want to have to then go promote it.","Sometimes I think fashion is more of a conversation between men than it is for women.","I think of myself as unconventional, I guess. I maybe always had a problem with authority, like a stubbornness about what's expected - despite wanting to get some recognition through performing - but also not always wanting to do the expected thing.","You can't be a strong or cool woman and be represented except in a harsh way, looking mean and cold and hard. It's like reverse sexism.","I don't really feel comfortable anywhere except when I'm working alone at home. It's exhausting to be out around people.","I never thought about doing anything other than making art.","I think that certainly, whenever you have a new band, the first record always has a certain energy to it before you know what you're doing. I think some of the early Sonic Youth stuff was maybe like that.","I don't have any desire to do something that sounds explicitly rock. Like, I don't have a burning need to be a rock musician. I feel like I've taken that as far as I can take it, for me.","Everyone's so interior now, they're not really looking around them. They're on their phones.","L.A. prides itself on newness or being the last frontier or just not liking old things and tearing them down to build new things. But Malibu history is interesting to me. My mom's family was one of the early families in California, so there's history going back to the 1840s or '50s.","I really want to start playing basketball. I actually bought a new basketball.","Basketball and ping-pong are my two forms of exercise.","My parents lived by Rancho Park. And my mom, later in life, got into playing golf. She and her male cronies would get up at five in the morning and sneak onto the back nine. I kind of just started getting into it. For a long time, I was really puzzled by why people liked it.","Working on art, as opposed to being in a constant collaborative state, as in a band, is something that I've always done - to a smaller degree, but it always remained a part of my integral self.","Sonic Youth, for better or worse, is/was a machine that carried me along through pregnancy, motherhood, and creative opportunities I never would have achieved on my own. I'm grateful and surprised that we were listened to, loved, ignored, and overrated.","I don't even know if I always entirely get what I'm trying to say right away with lyrics. I like a lot of things that are more subtext. I grew up mishearing lyrics my whole life, but somehow there's so much more, too, that's implied in vocal delivery and the music itself and the gestural quality of it.","I would be too self-conscious if I just thought of writing lyrics for a song. I have to trick myself into doing it.","I can't think about whether I'll disappoint Sonic Youth fans. It's not like I want people to be disappointed, but I just can't control that.","It's really hard for me to sing and play bass. Unless you're singing something that's kind of in rhythm with the bass, the melodies, it's just difficult.","Part of my desire to play music was because I wanted to escape the art world and the politics of it; the petty gossip-y art world. But you know, I feel like they're both equal forms of expression.","I've done art on my own, and I've also collaborated with other people to make art. And collaborating with other people is always interesting because you end up doing things you probably wouldn't do otherwise.","I do retweet some of the things that people say about the things I've done, but I don't necessarily want to use it to promote myself because I find that it gets kind of boring. There should just be a whole different site for that. Because it's just kind of boring and gross to use it just self-promotion.","I love the way Lady Gaga finds humour in fashion, but it's still very stylised.","It's hard to say when the life of a band starts and stops... but playing music together is an act of trust. When that's broken, it's impossible to continue.","I wasn't very confident about clothes; I was always hunting through racks, never sure what looked right. It can be like that again when you're older.","I went to art school, and I wanted to be an artist since I was 5. I basically moved to New York to do art, and I just sort of fell into doing music at an early age.","I don't see myself as a rock star. I don't see myself in that way. I'm interested in work that offers some sort of critical dialogue.","It is fun to smash guitars.","I'm kind of a sloppy feminist. Any ideology makes me a little nervous because there's some point where it doesn't allow for the complexity of things.","I watch 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' with my daughter. We're very into Buffy and Buffy's friends.","I picked up the bass kind of postpunk-style. There's a real art to not learning how to play an instrument and being able to still play it.","I'll leave a store if I hate the music. If it's just, like, techno, I feel like my brain is going to explode.","I'm a mom, but I don't always want to look just like that.","I love Northampton. As exciting and glamorous as New York can be, I'm always really relieved to get back there.","I was kind of freaked out by the art world in the 1980s. Just the money thing. All the competition over artists.","After you've graduated, you're supposed to be an adult and go out into the world, and you're still not formed. It's an interesting... horrible, horrible time.","I never felt like I had anything really figured out. When I was a teenager, it was all about teenagers having an 'identity crisis.' That was the phrase that was used. But in my early 20s, I was still like, 'When am I going to be over that?'","I like that show 'Ray Donovan' - I'm obsessed with that. He's in Hollywood, he's some kind of a fixer, but he's also kind of a thug. And 'Scandal,' the D.C. one with Kerry Washington.","I am basically a shy person, so performing sometimes helps me focus - having all those people concentrate their attention on you. I don't see it so much as becoming another person onstage; it's more exploring a different side of your personality.","It's hard to get hot over a painting; there's no equivalent for teenage obsessiveness. Art obsession is ideology. Ideology can be made sexy, but it's easier in music."],"Kim Harrison":["Music moves society more than most people realize. In my opinion, it's a soft manipulator of influence and change.","I've found that when I'm having trouble solidifying a character or a scene, that music will often free my subconscious just that last little bit to allow me to move forward, and often it's in a direction that I didn't expect, but is 100 percent true to the character.","I never considered I might make a career out of writing as I was going to school, so when I did turn my attentions that way, I was very ill prepared, having only what I read as a guide, and no formal training whatsoever. I credit that very ignorance with a great deal of my success.","Don't fall into the trap of having to have everything perfect to write or wait until the mood strikes you. If you want it as a job, treat it like a job, and just as you don't go to work only when you feel like it, you have to condition yourself to sit and write even when the ideas don't flow.","I wish I could say I write 9-5. It's usually more like 8-6, every day but the weekends.","Teens like a lot of the same things adults do: smart people doing amazing things against awful odds.","People ask me what I do in my spare time, and I look at them blankly, truly believing that I don't even have spare time, and if I did, I'd probably use it for something mundane, like chipping away at the mound of laundry rising to dangerous proportions in the back room.","I grew up reading SF in the '70s and '80s, and I like fast, thought-provoking plots that take you places in fully realized worlds.","I love the power of the musician who composes and performs. I envy their ability to put a nugget of truth in three minutes of sweat and emotional outpouring, colored entirely from their thoughts.","'Dandelion Wine' became one of the few books that I returned to time and again, and while not anywhere near the story crafter as Mr. Bradbury, I hope I managed to absorb by osmosis some of his techniques.","If I give a book as a gift, it is invariably a children's book with beautiful artwork and a simple text. I adore the feel of them, the care taken in the artwork, and the high visual stimulation that sets off the simple but often powerful message the text conveys.","My editor picked out the name she wanted. I was either going to be Kim Harrison or Lisa Harrison, because she wanted me shelved right next to Hamilton.","I was very introverted. You know, I had my close group of friends, but I really didn't care what the cool kids were doing.","'Dead Witch Walking' is basically a modern-day witch living in Cincinnati."],"Kim Hunter":["I think it's because it was an emotional story, and emotions come through much stronger in black and white. Colour is distracting in a way, it pleases the eye but it doesn't necessarily reach the heart.","The only problem was that I couldn't communicate with Dario. He speaks Italian and I don't. We had a translator the whole time. I just felt that something was lost with the go between. He was a delightful man, but I wish we could have spoken the same language.","The King and Queen made the rounds after the film. We were told how we were to respond, and we were in a semi circle in the lounge area of the cinema, they came around after the King, the Queen and both Princesses.","A lot of more modern films seem to just be out for violence or sex or what have you, without relating it to what's going within human beings. But every now and then one comes along that does that, and it's a joy.","I got so anxious sitting in the make-up chair for hours with my face covered. I had my doctor write a prescription for valium. I couldn't have done it without the pill.","I remember that Scott Jacoby was a nice young man.","It's hard to compare actors from different generations.","My agent sent me the script and I loved it. I wondered how they would turn me into a chimp. My agent said it would probably not entail to much time. Just some hair and make-up. I found out that it was not so simple.","Some things a lady doesn't tell."],"Kim Il-sung":["The oppressed peoples can liberate themselves only through struggle. This is a simple and clear truth confirmed by history.","Lenin lived, Lenin lives, Lenin will live.","The most important thing in our war preparations is to teach all our people to hate U.S. imperialism. Otherwise, we will not be able to defeat the U.S. imperialists who boast of their technological superiority.","We are opposed to the line of compromise with imperialism. At the same time, we cannot tolerate the practice of only shouting against imperialism, but, in actual fact, being afraid to fight it.","Peace secured by slavish submission is not peace.","Otherwise, we will not be able to defeat the U.S. imperialists who boast of their technological superiority.","It is wrong to try to avoid the struggle against imperialism under the pretext that independence and revolution are important, but that peace is still more precious.","The peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America have common interest and are in the position to support each other in their anti-imperialist and anti-U.S. struggle. As long as Africa and Latin America are not free.","It is necessary to expose the false propaganda of the imperialists and thoroughly dispel the illusion that the imperialists will give up their positions in the colonies and dependent countries with good will.","South Koreans who have seen and praised the mass games should remember the hardship of tearful children. Teachers drive them hard with curses and orders to repeat and repeat. When the children return home in the evening, they can hardly walk."],"Kim Jee-woon":["Overseas directors who want to work in Hollywood, the language barrier is not a problem. With the right talent, any director can be successful.","I'm someone who has a singular goal in making films: I want to tell a story. There are certain stories that I want to tell. Hollywood's never really been the ultimate goal for me.","The Western is as American as a film can get - there's the discovery of a frontier, the element of a showdown, revenge, and determining the best gunman. There's a certain masculinity to the Western that really appealed to me, and I've always wanted to do a Western in Hollywood.","What can possibly be the common factor in a Kim Jee-woon film? I think what really ties a lot of my projects together is that there is always a character that believes his life is not exactly the way he wishes it to be. My regard for that character turns out to be a very sympathetic one.","I'm not an outgoing person. Compared to an average person, I am quite skeptical and pessimistic. This is different from being nervous.","Actors are the flowers of the film, of the set, and of the director. The term 'Flowers of the Screen' holds a deep meaning.","In Korea, the director is on top, and the power flows down vertically. On the set, I love to come up with ideas on the spot. But in Hollywood, if I were to come up with a certain idea on set, the idea had to be taken to all these different people who had to agree.","Obviously, I've made several films in Korea, so I'm very well accustomed and acclimated to Korean filmmaking.","I've made the film 'The Good, the Bad, the Weird,' which was an Eastern Western film. Obviously, the Western film is American and American only; there's really no Western genre over in Asia.","America is a country that, even with all its flaws, has been able to flourish because there is a certain ideology about fighting for what you believe in. What you choose to believe in - no matter how small or big it is - is what you believe in, and that ideology has made America.","Korean films have always been distributed to international audiences as arthouse films.","I want to work with a wide range of genres because it gives each film a different cinematic energy.","After my film 'The Tale of Two Sisters,' I received a lot of offers from Hollywood to direct, but because 'A Tale of Two Sisters' was a horror film, I received a lot of horror films. But I wasn't interested in working in the same genre, and the scripts I received for films in different genres were for projects that were near completion.","I think my tendency when working is to try and find what's lacking in my current project and then tackle that in whatever I do next.","I work from opposites to opposites, in a way. It's finding one thing and then doing the other from film to film. So maybe after 'I Saw the Devil,' I might do something like 'I Saw the Angel' or perhaps something warm and happy.","We all desire things that we believe we cannot have, and so my films reflect that again and again. The mystery must be solved, the goal attained.","'The Good, the Bad, the Weird' is about individuals fulfilling their desires and just going the distance to fulfill that desire.","Of course, 'The Last Stand' has a villain who is traveling to the border to fulfill his own desires, but it's more about the main character. The Sheriff putting a stop to this villain and defending his town. 'The Last Stand' is more about protecting something. About protecting a value.","In Korea, the director has the final word. If the director makes a decision, that decision is final. In Hollywood, every decision needs to go through the producer, the studio, and sometimes even the main actor. There is a certain procedure that needs to be followed.","One quality that a director needs to acquire in Hollywood is to understand the system and figure out how to work within the system to express one's own ideas.","Lionsgate and Lorenzo di Bonaventura saw my Korean Western-style film, 'The Good, the Bad, the Weird,' and probably felt that I would be right for 'The Last Stand,' which could be classified as a modern Western.","I never make films thinking 'This is my film. This right here is undoubtedly Kim Jee-Woon style.' I am not even sure what 'Kim Jee-Woon style' is. When I make films, I never allow myself to make hard-set decisions ahead of time."],"Kim Ji-woon":["Obviously, I've made several films in Korea, so I'm very well accustomed and acclimated to Korean filmmaking.","I'm someone who has a singular goal in making films: I want to tell a story. There are certain stories that I want to tell.","Hollywood's never really been the ultimate goal for me.","My background is in acting, so I enjoy being able to show what I'm looking for. With acting, it's very immediate when you show someone what you're looking for, and the feedback is instantaneous as well.","Korean films have always been distributed to international audiences as arthouse films.","I want to work with a wide range of genres because it gives each film a different cinematic energy.","A lot of people are very interested that a Korean director has made a western. But when I look at the reactions of the audience, I realise the points at which people laugh are the same for a Korean audience and an international audience.","I want to do science fiction with dark stories.","Whatever it is that I thirst for in my current project tends to turn up in my following project.","I've been thinking of doing a sci-fi thriller or a sci-fi noir, if that's possible.","What can possibly be the common factor in a Kim Jee-woon film? I think what really ties a lot of my projects together is that there is always a character that believes his life is not exactly the way he wishes it to be.","We all desire things that we believe we cannot have, and so my films reflect that again and again. The mystery must be solved, the goal attained."],"Kim Jong Il":["A man who dreads trials and difficulties cannot become a revolutionary. If he is to become a revolutionary with an indomitable fighting spirit, he must be tempered in the arduous struggle from his youth. As the saying goes, early training means more than late earning.","National defense is the sacred duty of the young and all other people.","The revolution is carried out by means of one's thought, not through one's family background.","We oppose the reactionary policies of the U.S. government but we do not oppose the American people. We want to have many good friends in the United States.","Great ideology creates great times.","No production of high ideological and artistic value can evolve out of a creative group whose members are not united ideologically and in which discipline and order have not been established.","The liquidation of colonialism is a trend of the times which no force can hold back.","Imperialist aid is a noose of plunder and subjugation, aimed at robbing 10 and even 100 things for one thing that is given.","No faction is better or worse than any other. All come from the same mould; they are all products of capitalist influence in the working class movement. And they are a poison that destroys our Party and the working class movement in Korea.","Overall relations between the North and the South have developed in favor of national reconciliation, unity and reunification.","A film with an untidy plot cannot grip the audience and define their emotional response.","The cinema occupies an important place in the overall development of art and literature."],"Kim Jong-un":["Patriotism is not an abstract concept. It begins from one's own home. It buds out from the love for one's parents, spouses and children, the love for one's own home, village and workplace, and further develops into the love for one's country and fellow people.","There can be neither today without yesterday nor tomorrow without today.","There is no force in the world that can block the powerful march of our army and people, who are holding high the banner of the suns of great Comrade Kim Il Sung and great Comrade Kim Jong Il and continuing to advance under the leadership of the party and with strong faith in sure victory.","Construction is an important front for solidifying the foundations of a thriving country and creating bases for the people's happy life.","Our republic is a responsible nuclear state that, as we made clear before, will not use nuclear weapons first unless aggressive hostile forces use nuclear weapons to invade on our sovereignty.","The days are gone forever when our enemies could blackmail us with nuclear bombs.","Science and technology are a propellant for building a thriving country, and the happiness of the people and the future of the country hinge on their development.","Our Party maintains the improvement of the people's living conditions as the most important of the numerous state affairs.","Those who do not cherish affection for their parents, spouses and children and for their homes, villages and workplaces cannot love their country and fellow people; they can never become genuine patriots.","We should educate all Party members and other working people to become genuine patriots who first love their parents, spouses and children and further sincerely shed sweat and dedicate their all to spruce up their homes, villages and workplaces so that they are better than others' and add lustre to their country, their motherland.","It is a proud tradition and fighting trait of our army and people to rise up like mountains and go through fire and water to unfailingly carry through the party's orders and instructions.","Socialism is a sacred cause for realizing the demand and desire of the masses of the people for independence; it is a revolutionary cause that advances amid a fierce struggle against imperialism and all other counterrevolutionary forces.","The industrial revolution in the new century is, in essence, a scientific and technological revolution, and breaking through the cutting edge is a shortcut to the building of an economic giant.","If we are to successfully build a socialist civilized country, which our people are desirous of, and ultimately solve the rural question, we should step up the cultural revolution in the countryside.","My noble respect also goes to the anti-Japanese revolutionary forerunners, martyrs of the People's Army and other patriotic martyrs who dedicated all their precious things to promoting the development of our Party and the prosperity of the country in loyal support of the great leaders.","The history of the Workers' Party of Korea is a proud course it has traveled shouldering the destiny of the people and leading the Korean revolution to victory under the guidance of the great leaders.","Nothing will be beyond our reach when we make the flames of creating positive deeds flare up across the country with the virtues of the young vanguard as the initial spark and bring into full play the mounting vigour of the millions of young people.","A rational system and order for educational administration should be established on the principle of ensuring smooth progress of teaching and scientific research by teachers and researchers, and of edification of students.","It is important to launch a mass and society-wide struggle to drastically increase the production of consumer goods.","There is nothing that our party failed to do when it trusted the soldiers and people, and a more resplendent future is unfolding before us today.","A revolutionary party is, in its essence, the party of its leader that carries out his ideology and cause, and the main thing in its building is to ensure the unitary character and inheritance of his ideology and leadership.","All the organizations and officials of Chongryon, regarding this unity as the great foundation of the movement of Koreans in Japan, should rally themselves around the central leadership with one mind and purpose, and accomplish its patriotic cause, which was pioneered with comradely unity, by dint of comradeship.","In the days of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle, our women waged a bloody struggle with weapons in their hands to liberate their country.","All Party members, service personnel, and other people should turn out as one with ardent loyalty to the Party and extraordinary patriotic zeal, and demonstrate the spirit and mettle of Korea that is rushing forward towards final victory racing against time.","Our Party attaches great importance to the work with young people and firmly believes in them.","All Party organizations should maintain implementing the Party's lines and policies as the major line of Party work, and carry every one of them to completion unconditionally.","When young people are powerful, our Party and People's Army are powerful, and there is nothing for us to be afraid of.","Our young people are patriots and heroes whom we can be proud of before the world; that they have a large contingent of such trustworthy young people is a great blessing for the Workers' Party of Korea and a source of pride for Korea, and this assures the great strength of our dignified state and its bright future.","Our cause is just, and the might of Korea that is united with truth is infinite.","Sports play a very important role in consolidating the national strength, adding lustre to the country's prestige and honour, inspiring people with national dignity and pride, and imbuing the whole society with revolutionary mettle.","The forest restoration campaign is a war to ameliorate nature.","The political and military position of socialism should be further cemented so that it can be an impregnable fortress.","We should raise fierce flames of innovations in the vanguard sectors, basic industrial sectors, and all other sectors of the national economy.","The strength of self-reliance and self-development is that of science and technology, and the shortcut to implementing the five-year strategy is to give importance and precedence to science and technology.","Forest restoration is a challenging and complex undertaking of raising young trees, transplanting them, and then cultivating them year in, year out in the face of harsh challenges of nature; it is a gigantic nature transformation project to turn all the mountains of the country into 'treasure mountains,' into 'gold mountains.'","No force can conquer the service personnel and people who, in support of their great leader, have turned out in the struggle to defend their country with confidence in the validity of their cause and their own strength - this is a law and a truth taught by history.","Success in the revolution and construction depends on how a party, the General Staff of the revolution, is built and on how its leadership role is enhanced.","The great Comrade Kim Jong Il was an outstanding leader who, true to the President's great idea, developed Chongryon into a pacesetter of patriotism, into a model of patriotic loyalty to the motherland, and into a prototype body of overseas compatriots.","Forests are precious resources of the country and a wealth to be handed down to posterity.","The great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, putting forward the development of sports as a matter that has an important bearing on the prosperity of the country and nation, indicated the road ahead of the Juche-based sports and wrote a new chapter in the history of building a sports power by dint of outstanding ideas and leadership.","Our party and the Republic's government will go hand in hand with anyone who truly desires the country's reunification and the nation's peaceful prosperity and will make responsible and patient efforts to accomplish the historic cause of the fatherland's reunification.","The ideological and cultural revolutions have been promoted successfully in the countryside with the result that the ideological and spiritual qualities of our agricultural working people have been transformed remarkably, and a great development has also been achieved in the realm of cultural life in the countryside.","For our country and people, October 10 is a meaningful revolutionary holiday when they celebrate the birth anniversary of the genuine vanguard of the revolution, its militant General Staff, which has taken responsibility for their destiny and leads them.","In the gigantic and worthwhile struggle for achieving the country's prosperity and people's happiness, our young people have been educated in a revolutionary way and trained spiritually and physically, and have developed into a large, matchless contingent forming a thousand-fold, tens-of-thousand-fold fortress around the Party.","We should ensure that the people-first principle runs through the whole of Party work as appropriate for its nature as a motherly party to make the climate of respecting, loving and depending on them pervade it and Party work focus on improving their living standards.","We should concentrate all our efforts on building an economic giant to bring about a fresh turn in developing the country's economy and improving the people's standard of living.","The first generation of the young people of our revolution took up arms following Comrade Kim Il Sung and fought the bloody anti-Japanese struggle, thus achieving the historic cause of national liberation.","The military might of a country represents its national strength. Only when it builds up its military might in every way can it develop into a thriving country.","The agricultural working people should be imbued with a thoroughgoing faith in socialism and steadfast anti-imperialist and class consciousness so that they can regard our style of socialism as their life and soul, love it ardently, and fight staunchly against the imperialists' moves for ideological and cultural infiltration.","Our Party conferred the honourable title, 'The Heroic Working Class of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il,' on our working class that supported the great leaders' ideas and leadership with loyalty.","Peasants, who after the liberation of the country became the masters of their lands and their country under the benevolence of Comrade Kim Il Sung, launched the campaigns for increasing agricultural production and donating cereals out of patriotism, and thus faithfully supported the Party's line of nation building.","Kim Il Sung University should set an example for all other universities of the country to follow in introducing innovative teaching methods.","Songun is a proud tradition of the Korean revolution which was pioneered by Comrade Kim Il Sung and led by him and Comrade Kim Jong Il and the banner of victory and glory.","The cause of the WPK is a sacred historic cause for fully realizing the independence of the masses of the people, the cause of the Juche revolution.","The Fatherland Liberation War, which the Korean people fought against the haughty U.S. imperialists who had battened on aggression and pillage, was, in fact, a hard fight that could be likened to a bare-handed man versus brigandish robbers.","It is the unshakeable determination and will of our Party to put forward young people in the vanguard of the ranks of the general onward march as masters of the times and help them put up the doorplate of a thriving country before anybody else.","The people's army should always maintain a highly agitated state and be equipped with full fighting readiness so as to smash the enemies with a single stroke if they make the slightest move and achieve the historic cause of the fatherland's reunification.","Past records of inter-Korean relations show that confrontation between fellow countrymen leads to nothing but war.","We should make innovations in coal-mining and metallurgical industries in particular so as to revitalize the overall economy of the country.","It is our Party's unshakeable stand to prevent a new war from breaking out on the Korean peninsula and accelerate economic construction in a peaceful environment, thus resolving at an early date the problems related with the people's livelihood.","Comrade Kim Jong Il, who was faithful to Comrade Kim Il Sung's ideas and cause, led our revolution along the glorious road of victory, braving the severe trials and adversities of history by dint of his unique leadership of the Songun revolution.","The history of our Party is just the path travelled by our great people: its might is their might, its greatness is their greatness, and its victory is the victory achieved by them.","Amid the historic struggle to accomplish the cause of the Juche revolution in this long period after its founding, it has developed into a revolutionary party of Juche, into the great party of Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, and wonderfully performed its role as the organization that guides our people to all victories.","Kim Il Sung University is the central base for training national cadres and the highest institute of Juche-based science and education.","The heroic working class of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, holding aloft the banner of modelling the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism, should become the engine propelling the masses forward on the general onward march and the example for all other members of society to follow in stepping up the building of a powerful socialist country.","The great Comrade Kim Jong Il provided energetic guidance to defend and honour Comrade Kim Il Sung's idea of and exploits in socialist rural construction and make UAWK organizations creditably perform their duties as organizations for ideological education.","The year 2016 was a year of revolutionary event, a year of great change, worthy of note in the history of our Party and country.","The entire Party, the whole army, and all the people should conduct a vigorous forest restoration campaign to make the mountains of the country thick with forests.","Building a sports power is a patriotic undertaking aimed at translating into reality the plan and wish of the great leaders, who devoted their efforts to building ours into a country that prospers and grows stronger on the strength of sports.","Less than two years after its founding, our Republic inflicted an ignominious defeat on the United States that had been boasting of being the 'strongest' in the world, thus defending its national sovereignty and global peace and security.","The proud road travelled by Chongryon bears the imprints of the wise guidance and painstaking efforts of the great leaders, who strengthened and developed Chongryon into a Juche-based overseas compatriots' body that represents the rights and interests of all the Koreans resident in Japan.","The idea of the Songun revolution is an idea of giving importance and precedence to military affairs in implementing the masses' cause of independence, the socialist cause, and pushing ahead with the overall revolution and construction with the revolutionary army as the core force.","We should improve economic guidance and management as demanded by the developing reality.","Comrade Kim Jong Il energetically led the work of defending and honouring Comrade Kim Il Sung's ideas of and

the van of our revolutionary ranks that display only victory and honor and will always encourage and drive us toward a new victory.","We must well grow the valuable seeds, which the great Comrade Kim Jong Il sowed to build an economically powerful state and improve the people's livelihood, and lead them to bloom as a glorious reality.","To apply Kim Jong Il's patriotism means to thoroughly materialize the General's intentions and desires for the prosperity of the country and the happiness of all generations to come and to carry on all work for achieving the prosperity of the country in the way he did.","All sectors and all units of the national economy should launch a vigorous general offensive to boost production in hearty response to the Party's militant slogan.","All sectors of the national economy should make scrupulous arrangements for economic planning and guidance to boost production by tapping every possible reserve and potentiality, and work out in a scientific way the immediate plans and long-term strategies for stage-by-stage development and push ahead with them in a persistent manner.","Developing the locally-run industry is very important in increasing the production of consumer goods.","While boosting the production of consumer goods, we should channel great efforts into improving the welfare service for the people.","Our Party's policies of respecting the people and loving them and the people's hearty loyalty of trusting and following the Party as they would do their mothers have become integrated, and thus the blood-sealed ties between them have reached a new, higher stage.","The historic sea changes that have taken place in our country's rural areas are clear proof of the validity and vitality of the socialist rural theses advanced by President Kim Il Sung.","In following an arduous and thorny path of revolution that has never been trodden by any other party or people in history, our Party has been firmly convinced of the validity and invincibility of its ideology and cause, and our people have hardened their will and resolve to advance forever along the road of Juche indicated by the Party.","Thanks to the great Juche idea and Songun politics of the Workers' Party of Korea and the devoted struggle of our service personnel and other people who are unfailingly loyal to the Party, proud victories have been achieved in socialist construction and lasting foundations for accomplishing the cause of the Juche revolution have been laid.","Comrade Kim Jong Il, by continuing the march of Songun without interruption and with absolute trust in our service personnel and other people who were faithful to the Party's cause, led the socialist cause of Juche along the road of victory.","The year 2015 was a year of gigantic struggle, which is adorned with meaningful events and eye-opening successes, a year of victory and glory, in which socialist Korea fully demonstrated its prestige and might.","The proud decades of victorious advance of the Juche-oriented youth movement are associated with the invaluable blood and sweat and heroic exploits of the young people who fought self-sacrificingly for the Party, the leader, the country, and the people.","Students at Kim Il Sung University are reserve hardcore talents who will become leading officials of the revolution responsible for the important sectors and posts in the building of a powerful socialist country, the backbone in the struggle for the victory of the Juche revolution.","The great leaders called the working class first whenever difficult and gigantic tasks arose for the revolution, and ushered in fresh heydays of the revolution by relying on them.","The GFTUK is a powerful political instrument for training its members, including the working class, into Kimilsungists-Kimjongilists with unfailing loyalty to the Party and the leader and mobilizing them to implement the revolutionary cause of Juche.","The women's movement in Korea is a Juche-oriented movement, which was pioneered by the great Comrade Kim Il Sung and which followed the proud road of development under the leadership of Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il.","The UAWK is a mass-based political organization of our socialist agricultural workers which was founded and has developed under the wise guidance of the great leaders, and a reliable transmission belt and peripheral organization of the Party.","Agricultural workers, together with the working class, constitute the main force in building a powerful socialist country, and the agricultural front is now a major thrust area in building the country into a socialist economic giant.","The single-hearted unity is the lifeblood of Juche Korea and the dynamic force for a leap forward, and we must invariably follow the road of self-reliance and self-development - this is the invaluable truth of the Juche revolution confirmed by our army's and people's gigantic struggle in 2016.","We should steadily intensify the work of establishing the Party's monolithic leadership system to make the whole Party share ideology with the Party Central Committee, breathe the same breath as it, and keep pace with it.","In order to develop the country's sports in line with the great leaders' ideas and plan of developing Juche-based sports, our Party directs great efforts to the work of the sports sector.","Chongryon should do all of its undertakings thoroughly as intended and wished by the great leaders, and usher in a new heyday of the movement of Koreans in Japan true to the General's instructions.","I am satisfied that our Party and youth league officials are devoting efforts to tending the garden of virtues with all sincerity true to the Party's idea of attaching importance to young people, and highly appreciate them with a warm heart."],"Kim Kardashian":["At the end of the day, life is about being happy being who you are, and I feel like we are so blessed to have the support system and the best family to really just support each other no matter what we're going through.","It's fun to have a partner who understands your life and lets you be you.","I think each shoot has a different personality.","I love when people underestimate me and then become pleasantly surprised.","Maybe my fairy tale has a different ending than I dreamed it would. But that's OK.","When there's so many haters and negative things, I really don't care.","Having lots of siblings is like having built-in best friends.","If I don't feel confident about my body, I'm not going to sit at home and feel sorry for myself and not do something about it. It's all about taking action and not being lazy. So you do the work, whether it's fitness or whatever. It's about getting up, motivating yourself and just doing it.","Obviously, as you grow up, no one's ever 100 percent proud of every decision that they've made, and that's OK. I think as long as you learn from your mistakes and don't make them over and over again, you're on the right path.","I'm an entrepreneur. 'Ambitious' is my middle name.","I am Armenian, so of course I am obsessed with laser hair removal! Arms, bikini, legs, underarms... my entire body is hairless.","I play into the perception of me, but it's not really me.","I think it would be so much fun to be in the White House.","When I turned 16, my dad made me sign a contract - he made us sign contracts for everything - that if I hit my car, I would be responsible for paying for it. I was in bumper-to-bumper traffic, and I tapped someone. It was so not a big deal, but I had to pay for it.","Holidays are the best. I couldn't imagine being from a small family.","You can't really have like high end designers for everything.","My decision to end my marriage was such a risk to lose ratings and lose my fan base. I had to take that risk for my inner peace and to be happy with myself.","I'm the true definition of a workaholic.","I didn't love school.","People are recognizing that I am an entrepreneur and do more than be on a reality TV show.","If I look at the message I'm portraying, I think it definitely is be who you are, but be your best you.","I always put clothes and family photos under the mattress, in case the house burns down.","There are always going to be ridiculous rumours.","White is actually one of my favorite colors. I have a white car. I love white.","You make mistakes, but I don't have any regrets. I'm the kind of person who takes responsibility for it and deals with it. I learn from everything I do. I work very hard, I have so many things going on in my life. Get to know me and see who I am.","People don't understand the pressure on me to look perfect.","You never know what the future holds or where my life will take me.","I promote a healthy lifestyle.","I love to eat - Kit Kats or cookies-and-cream ice cream. I need sugar like five times a day.","The perfect date for me would be staying at home, making a big picnic in bed, eating Wotsits and cookies while watching cable TV.","I'm totally growing up.","To look and feel my best, I watch my calories and exercise.","I think I'll always be a hopeless romantic.","I just feel my best when I'm all glammed up.","I get letters from little girls begging me to adopt them.","I'm not trying to influence anyone else; I'm not saying, 'Do what I do.' I think it's a little pretentious to say, 'I'm a role model'; I would never say that, and I don't think of myself that way.","I love the sun but don't have the time to get a good tan and keep it year-round, so I am a huge fan of tanning products.","I think if I'm 40 and I don't have any kids and I'm not married, I would have a baby artificially inseminated. I would feel like Mary - like Jesus is my baby.","Everything family does is reflection on the other people.","Personally, I've always loved the curvy look.","It's time to recognise the Armenian Genocide.","I urge people to learn from the mistakes of others. Please drink responsibly and it's never acceptable to drink and drive!","I love meeting new people and telling them about my stories and my projects that I am working on.","I couldn't sacrifice my heart for a publicity stunt.","My theory is, 'Happy mommy, happy baby.'","I think that there's the Kim Kardashian brand and the Kardashian brand. I think they blend together, but I have different qualities or interests that my sisters might not be so into.","I'm a really nostalgic person. I love taking photos and video and having memories. I remember all my childhood videos that my dad used to take. I think that's really what life is about - especially when you start a family of your own.","Who wouldn't want a baby girl? They're the best! And I know that's what Kanye has always wanted; he wanted a little girl.","I am hands-on in any project that I am associated with. I just don't want to put my face or name and lend it to a product that I'm not behind a hundred percent.","I've always been a businesswoman.","Even the people I surround myself with... are wiser, a little bit older than me, where before, all my boyfriends were younger.","There's more pressure to be famous for being yourself than if you're being a character.","If I feel something, it's how I feel. I never say, 'I feel this way, so you should feel that way.' Not that there's anything wrong with it, but I just am who I am. But, yeah. I think you would call me a feminist.","I'm totally not against plastic surgery. I've tried Botox before. That's the only thing that I've done.","I went to college for four years.","I do rely on having a full face on.","I am fascinated by crime scene investigating. I swear, I wish I was a crime scene investigator sometimes!","I feel lazy when I'm not working. I learned all my business sense from my dad. He always believed in me, and I think the last thing he said to me before he passed away was, 'I know you're gonna be OK. I'm not worried about you'.","There was at time in my life where all I wanted was a relationship, and I thought that was the most important thing.","I wanted to be a teacher.","I'm constantly on the go.","I've made mistakes in my life for sure.","If I like a food, I'll eat it, even if I know it's not good for me.","If you're a basketball player and you don't stop and take pictures with your fans, you can have an amazing game and everyone still loves you.","When I gain a pound it's in the headlines.","I'd be foolish not to take some of these opportunities that are coming my way.","I don't really have goals as far as, I want to be on a cover or something like that.","I will always believe in love, but my idea has changed from what I've always thought.","I hate to talk about myself.","My career is based on openness and honesty.","Botox to me is not surgery.","I would rather have been beaten up in the media than live a life that wasn't happy.","I have to be in a relationship in order to be intimate. I'm not the one-night-stand kind of girl. Despite the rumors.","I don't even drink! I can't stand the taste of alcohol. Every New Year's Eve I try one drink and every time it makes me feel sick. So I don't touch booze - I'm always the designated driver.","I know people think we drive around in these nice cars and we do whatever we want and our parents will pay our credit cards, but that's not the case. Sure, my parents were generous; I got a nice car at 16, but at 18 I was cut off. I've worked really hard. I opened the store myself.","I was raised with a huge Armenian influence, always hearing stories of Armenia, celebrating Armenian holidays.","I am so stereotyped into being this Hollywood girl.","Now is the one time in my life I can be 100% selfish. I'm not married; I don't have kids; I can focus on my career."],"Kim Ki-duk":["A director should not define everything. For me, the movie is a form of a question I pose to the others or to the audience. I want to ask their opinion on my point of view and discuss it with them.","An artist's creative energy is ephemeral as a flower. It blooms and soon dies. No artist is great forever. Personally, I think I reached my peak in 2004 when I shot 'Samaria' and '3-Iron'.","I don't think that the spoken words solve everything. Sometimes silence delivers truer feelings while the words can distort the meaning in some situations.","Yes I did study to be a preacher, but I didn't finish.","I don't have the ability to find a middle ground with my audiences, and I know this too well.","I don't really know how I grow. I can only see the changes when I look at the films.","Many people who have watched 'Pieta' have said my filmmaking has become more objective.","A person's current personality of love, hatred, jealousy, rage or a murderous intent and so on is formed upon genetic elements, education, the environment and a family a person grows in.","I try not to interpret things of the world into a single meaning. Rather, I try the opposite.","I always concentrate on respecting human beings and their lives and the meaning within their lives, and I believe that is something people around the world can appreciate."],"Kim Mathers":["Every time I find a picture of him with other women, or read in magazines that he's involved with 'groupies,' I don't go and show up where he is making a huge scene and getting our faces put all over the TV and papers.","First and foremost, I would like to start off by saying that just because my husband is an entertainer, that does not mean that our personal business is for everyone's entertainment purposes.","My husband came up to Hot Rocks to check up on me, why is still unknown to me because if I was to cheat on him it wouldn't be in a neighborhood bar where he knows I am.","Money is great, but it doesn't make your husband stay at home with you.","I had low self-esteem. I just really wanted attention and love from somebody.","I am trying to move forward with my life."],"Kim Matula":["I had actually tested first with 'Young and Restless' for the role of Daisy. It came down to three of us, but I didn't book that job. A couple of weeks later, I was told that I had an audition for 'B&B.' I did two auditions, and they booked me. It was a short process, which I greatly appreciated!","I have a pretty good sense of direction. And if I get lost, I just act like I know where I'm going.","I've always been worried about being late for things, so I'm 30 - 40 minutes early for everything. That's a habit I'll keep going."],"Kim Newman":["I've often described my book 'Anno Dracula' as 'literally, a vampire novel' - in that it battens on to other novels and sucks their lifeblood, transforming as well as feeding off them.","Dracula can sustain many interpretations and exists in many phantasmal forms... and Johnny Alucard is my attempt to explore the multiplicity of Draculas unloosed on the world in the long wake of Stoker's novel."],"Kim Novak":["Just touching that old tree was truly moving to me because when you touch these trees, you have such a sense of the passage of time, of history. It's like you're touching the essence, the very substance of life.","If you're wanting glamorous or really beautiful or really sexy, well then, I wasn't really the one, but I could do all of that. You could just get really lost in that kind of image.","I already hated that gray suit and then having to go through putting on that wig with a false front - again made me feel so trapped inside this person who was desperately wanting to break out of it but she was so caught up in the web of deception that she couldn't.","For every answer, I like to bring up a question. Maybe I'm related to Alfred Hitchcock or maybe I got to know him too well, but I think life should be that way.","I didn't want to start relying on what someone else thought was right. It was easier to go away all together.","I don't think you want to give all the answers, but I think every answer you do give should bring up another question, and not all questions should be answered.","I loved acting, which was never about money, the fame. It was about a search for meaning. It was painful.","My security comes from my senses, my sensing the direction I should go and suddenly I felt out of tune, out of step with what other people wanted or what other people expected of me.","The thing I loved about Alfred Hitchcock is that he left a lot of open ends there, a lot of clues that didn't really add up the way you think they would, and sometimes, not at all.","I live way out in the country, so there's not a lot of people around to remind me. And my friends don't think of me as 'Kim Novak' anymore anyway. It's like they forgot, too. And so it's nice.","I had a lot of resentment for a while toward Kim Novak. But I don't mind her anymore. She's okay. We've become friends. I even asked her before this trip for some beauty tips.","And I went through a lot of detours and I took a lot of roads and things so yes, that's all there, but it's not meant to be shocking or telltale.","As I said, I began losing confidence in my instincts, which is tough and very bad for an instinctive person.","Harry Cohn did not make me. But I also feel that I probably didn't make me, either. I think it was a combination. I think that's what made it work.","I always felt Jimmy was trapped in Hollywood. He felt it himself. He loved aviation so much and he wanted to be able to do more of that. He somehow just got stuck here.","I don't feel that I was a Hollywood-created star.","I knew Rita Hayworth only enough to know that she was just a tender, sensitive, beautiful human being. A lovely person. Very gentle. She would never stand up for her rights.","I think it will be helpful to people because I know the expectations that are put on you as a sex symbol, and how Marilyn Monroe suffered and so on, and I was able to get free of that.","I tried so hard with movies like Vertigo and Middle of the Night and others. I felt those would show me that it's only a matter of time before I'd find the right one to reach out and touch people.","I used Jimmy to give me what I needed to keep going and to know that I was on the right path with it. I thought I saw Jimmy's soul all the time we worked. He never covered his soul and I never covered mine. We saw into each other's souls, very definitely.","I was always opinionated.","It means nothing if the movie doesn't get out there.","My first day at MGM they decided to bring this lion out, male, and it was not the best time for him to see me. All of a sudden he thought I was in heat and this lion went into the dressing room, which was just a trailer on the sound stage, and went crazy.","So, Hitchcock wouldn't say anything about my work in the movie but, on the other hand, he wouldn't complain, either.","The first time I was in his office was when they called me in to tell me they had changed my name. I had a feeling that if I'd gone along with the name they'd chosen, I'd never be seen again. I'd be swallowed up by that name, because it was a false name: Kit Marlowe.","The script was always the most important thing to me and I loved the script. For one thing, I've always admired trees. I just worship them. Think what trees have witnessed, what history, such as living through the Civil War, yet they still survive.","The work I did in Vertigo meant nothing if no one cared about the movie. Luckily, Vertigo had a revival and people had begun to recognize there was something special and it gained in reputation. But it just as well could have ended up rotting in film cans somewhere.","We only did probably two, three takes on every scene we did, at the most.","Well, I'm Czech, but Polish, Czech, no matter, it's my name."],"Kim Philby":["To betray, you must first belong.","It cannot be so very surprising that I adopted a Communist viewpoint in the 1930s; so many of my contemporaries made the same choice. But many of those who made that choice in those days changed sides when some of the worst features of Stalinism became apparent. I stayed the course.","Friendship is the most important thing of all.","I am really two people. I am a private person and a political person. Of course, if there is a conflict, the political person comes first."],"Kim Raver":["As long as I get those running shoes on, then there's no turning back, and I have to go for that run. As long as you've got those workout clothes, you've got them on, you've got to go.","In this business, there is an insane amount of pressure, spoken and unspoken, to be thin. If you look at some of the television shows, eating disorders become like a competitive thing.","For a quick, healthy meal that's also fun for kids, I serve fish tacos: soft tortillas, lettuce, tomatoes, black beans and brown rice.","We always have dinner together as a family - even when our schedules are totally hectic. I inherited that from my mom, who would come home from her ad agency job to eat with us before going back to work.","Maybe because I didn't have a huge film career right off the bat, I've been able to create something different, which is so important to me. That's myself, my idea of who I am.","I had this roommate in college who would get up almost 2 hours before class to do hair and makeup. That's not for me.","When you live in America, it's kind of insular - the news coverage that you get - unless you're really smart about it and find more international news coverage. I've learned that from my husband. In the French culture, they talk politics.","When I started 'Third Watch,' I knew I was going to be with the firefighters and lifting, so I was doing yoga, running, and swimming - all at the same time. I didn't have a kid then. Now I don't have time for that. I want to spend time with my son and my husband, so it's mainly just yoga now.","You finish a job and it's very emotional because you're working crazy long hours, and your work family is like a real family.","For me, because I've been working out since I graduated college, I have to mix it up. But it's not just working out for health's sake; it's also a whole mindset for me. Yoga is really important for that.","I have a dog. He needs to be walked, and I love running, so I pull out my running shoes.","I've learned from my French husband and the way they eat, it's all about moderation. And that's really sustainable.","I love to roll out of bed and throw something on. I had this roommate in college who would get up almost 2 hours before class to do hair and makeup. That's not for me.","When you live in America, it's kind of insular - the news coverage that you get - unless you're really smart about it and find more international news coverage.","In the French culture, they talk politics. I didn't find it was part of our culture to have political arguments at the table. My husband's family will get into major politics, and it's not an aggressive thing. It's so interesting and you learn so much, whether it's Right or Left, and that to me has been really great.","I think it's necessary to let kids get bored once in a while - that's how they learn to be creative.","When I need a break from the boys, I go with my girlfriend to buy pretty little dresses for her daughter.","I think what's so interesting for me is the different roles that I play. I love doing the research, and I love - I feel fortunate in the sense that I get to explore many different worlds, of things that I may not really get to learn a lot about.","I just am a huge fan of PBS. They've taken great risks from great shows.","As women in general, I don't think we take the time to find ways to take care of ourselves.","My mom has always been a huge inspiration. She was a single mom raising two kids in New York. Now that is full-on all the time.","In my sports or workout life, I like to prove to myself I can do something, whether it's a half marathon or whatever it is. I like to take challenges that scare me because then once we've accomplished it, we feel stronger.","There seems to be a theme running through the women I play. They take their circumstances and try to make the best of them.","I have an incredible role model in my mom. She was a single mother raising two kids in New York.","For me, the amazing thing was entering into this amazing world of 'Sesame Street.' We'd be in the kids' room, and there was a door into the soundstage that said '1-2-3 Open Sesame.' I remember pushing that door open and going into this incredible magical world of make-believe. In one episode, I was playing football with Joe Namath."],"Kim Rhodes":["The best part about playing a mom is that people hug moms. I get hugs all the time. It really makes hard days a lot easier, and easy days are downright joyous.","I landed in Los Angeles where I've stayed, with one year-long exception when I returned to Ashland as an actor in the Oregon Shakespeare Festival.","It's pure vanity that keeps me eating healthy, but I adore fried food and sugar.","I have some very dear friends I stalk consistently when I come home.","It's an amazing blessing to go to work every day with people I genuinely love."],"Kim Richards":["You can take the girl out of Beverly Hills, but you can't take the Beverly Hills out of the girl.","My favorite movie out of the old movies was 'Escape to Witch Mountain.' We were working with horses and bears, and when you have a great friend like Ike and a great director... it was a great experience.","It's 2009, things change. I'm a creature of habit, so in the beginning I wanted it to be as much like the original as possible, but that's not reality. And reality is, this is a new generation, and people want to see 'Witch Mountain' again.","Growing up as a child actress, there was much I got to do and yet so much that I missed out on. Therefore, when I had kids, I made it a point to make sure that they could do anything and everything that they dreamed of. A great education was definitely right at top of my list!"],"Kim Shaw":["Everyone's been on a ramen noodle diet once or twice.","I like the intimacy of independent films and I like the idea that people aren't being paid necessarily as much money as some one on a studio film.","Everyone always asks me, 'Do you want to be famous... ' I never really thought about becoming famous. I just want to work, to be able to put out inspiring and good film and TV.","I love movies, I love television and I know that the kind of stuff I love to watch and that's what I want to do.","With any modern relationship between a man and a woman, everyone - including their own friends - assume that they're going to hook up.","I probably wore out my VHS copy of 'Office Space.'","I'm a huge fan of Asian cooking in general. I love shabu shabu, and I love hibachi. It's kind of like an experience as opposed to just having something in front of you and you eating it.","I'm really proud of this show I did called 'I Just Want My Pants Back.' I was very proud of my work on the show and such a huge fan of everybody involved."],"Kim Smith":["I love meeting new people; I think everyone has a story to tell. We should all listen sometimes.","My greatest achievement so far is that I've been able to continue with my normal life. I love what I do, but more so, I'm glad to have people who care about me close by.","I hope that in 5 years from now I'll be working and doing what makes me happy. Whatever that may be.","I was at this model search with a friend, supporting her, and next thing you know I ended up in it.","I love what I do, but more so, I'm glad to have people who care about me close by.","Models are what they are... people who model clothing, that's all.","Pickup lines are a major turn-off, they don't work on me and I tune them out. It's better to just be honest.","I'm still reading some scripts and I model as well, so I'm still doing that. But I don't want to do like just anything so we're being really selective about the stuff I'll do."],"Kim Stanley Robinson":["Science fiction rarely is about scientists doing real science, in its slowness, its vagueness, the sort of tedious quality of getting out there and digging amongst rocks and then trying to convince people that what you're seeing justifies the conclusions you're making.","You can't get any movement larger than five people without including at least one flippin idiot.","Life is insanely robust, though we can make species go extinct, and this is the bad thing. So I always make the point that you can't say, 'Is it too late?' That is the terrible question, because either answer promotes inaction. If it's too late, you don't need to act; if it's not too late, you don't need to act.","That's libertarians for you - anarchists who want police protection from their slaves.","Many of the technologies we've invented are necessary to keep 6.5 billion people alive. We can't go back from that, so we need to decarbonize really rapidly.","A lot of scientists act on their beliefs and so do things that look crazy to the rest of us.","That's one of the ironies of our time: Right when we're on the edge of serious improvements in health care, we're also cooking the planet.","We should conceive of ourselves not as rulers of Earth, but as highly powerful, conscious stewards: The Earth is given to us in trust, and we can screw it up or make it work well and sustainably.","You can never properly predict the future as it really turns out. So you are doing something a little different when you write science fiction. You are trying to take a different perspective on now.","Apocalyptic thinking happens on the left as well as on the right, and in environmentalism, that's a terrible approach to take. Because it isn't true.","If the amount of money going into the war economy were invested in landscape restoration, we would be in a far more positive position. It may get a little dire before we pull together, but I think when the prosperous nations, and in particular the U.S., realize they're wrecking their own kids' lives, there will be a mass change in value.","The only part of an argument that really matters is what we think of the people arguing."],"Kim Swift":["The drawings in 'Portal' were actually me scribbling that stuff... I had a funny moment when I realized that someone gotten 'The cake is a lie' tattooed on themselves. It was really interesting to see my handwriting tattooed on another human being. That... that's odd.","What's great about games in particular is that it's a socially acceptable way for adults to imagine.","I like that I make toys.","Being young is an advantage. You've grown up with games as the dominant entertainment. You have a lot of experience of video games. So what do you want to see that's not been done? Innovation is really low cost for you. You can afford to take risks and fail to execute new ideas.","Games can be art, and they can be significant and all the glorified things that we want them to be. But if you ask a kid if their toys are important, they'll say 'yes,' and 'Please don't take them away.'","Typically my ideas come to me in the most inane ways possible. I had the initial idea for 'Quantum Conundrum' while I was walking down the street to get breakfast. People are like, 'Whoa, what's your inspiration, is it something amazing?' No, I was just really hungry.","'Quantum Conundrum' is a direct reflection, not just of me, but of our entire team. It has a little bit of all of our personalities in it.","When I play games, I'll make up little stories for just anything. It's almost the game of making up background stories for people you see on the street. You know what I mean? I wasn't exactly the popular kid in school growing up, so I found myself really observing people, and watching how they interact, and how they react to things.","I was the lead designer on 'Portal,' and I really enjoyed making that type of game.","I think if a person plays 'Quantum Conundrum' and they walk away feeling really intelligent and skilled, that's what I want. That's my only goal.","I think different games have a different chemical release in your brain as far as reward goes. I like making puzzle games, just because I know I'm kinda good at it, and they really are superfun to work on.","I started working at Airtight Games after I shipped 'Left 4 Dead 2' back in 2009.","I love humorous games. I love to laugh, and I think it's a really great way to attract players.","I'd been at Valve since I got out of college. I felt like I kind of grew up there, and I wanted to see what else was out in the world. One of the owners of Airtight Games is a friend of mine, and he asked if I would run a team there. It just sounded like a great opportunity.","I think the downloadable scene in general is really, really interesting for developers because it's low-risk. It doesn't require as much money as a triple-A title. And it's a great proving ground for new IPs, new concepts, new ideas - things that I think I, as a developer, find really attractive.","I can't really change the games I like to make, and I can't change my own particular aesthetic.","'Quantum Conundrum' has a little bit of something for everybody - it's got something for kids and it's got enough of a challenge for a hardcore gamer.","One of the things I loved about working on 'Portal' was that we'd get emails from people saying, 'I love to play first-person shooters but my girlfriend won't play them with me. But I got her to play 'Portal' and she had a blast.'"],"Kim Weston":["The great thing about this thing we call art is that it has no rules.","The darkroom is just the means to an end.","A lot of my work comes from my life experiences.","The gallery is generating work for the masses.","I don't know, the older I get, the more complicated I think I get, which is a hindrance.","I tried painting for a short time and realized that I was not a child prodigy at painting.","In front of the camera I look and I see visually what I've created.","Any nude is a something you setup in front of the camera.","We all take from our artistic endeavors what we as individuals need, to make the process unique and fulfilling to ourselves.","No matter how fast I could do it with the digital camera I don't think I would get the same thing out of it. The passion I have for formulating an idea stands alone. It is the important essence of what I do.","To me, that is the essence of me as a photographer. It is those ideas, working with them, formulating them and eventually putting them down on paper, photographing them and then going on to the next step.","I think the digital camera would record that information too fast for me.","I think all photographers fit their vision to their personality.","I don't need the money I generate from photography to support myself.","If you're not going to tell something if you're not going to expose something it's real easy to go in and photograph from behind the camera and not expose any of your weaknesses.","I photographed rocks and trees and tide pools and nudes and all that stuff for years and years. Until 20 years ago when I found that I could do it in the studio and never have to travel.","My surprises come usually once I start rolling and photographing.","You work on an idea, your first interpretation is very raw and you work it and you work it and it gets polished and polished. It gets to a certain level and then it comes down off that peak.","Galleries, and they're all the same, and rightly so, they sell work.","If no one wants to jump into a Kim Weston and drive it down the street. That's fine with me I don't care. I know my work is good and I know it's serious work.","Well, now I'm an old photographer and I still don't sell.","I just love photographing. I don't do it for anyone else.","I felt no pressure that my grandfather was famous and my uncle was famous.","What I had to prove was that I had a dedication and a desire and a passion to do the work and everything else would fall in place because I have a vision that I want to portray and it did and I do it. I don't sell anything.","I don't think at that time I realized how important it was and how important it was for me to be here and carry on that legacy in our family of being a photographer.","My son does a little photography, but he's not involved the way I was.","Growing up, I didn't give my grandfather's photography a second thought. I wasn't involved in his work, except that I helped my dad print his negatives.","Uncle Brett had a definite vision that he was after, I don't think having a famous father affected him much.","As an artist you have to have a certain amount of arrogance.","I was always confident in my art and in myself as an artist.","Being a shy person, I always felt strange outside with my camera.","It doesn't matter what you do, as long as you're fulfilling that inner need, and for me the need is more the process than the finished product. My photographs are stories of the process.","I didn't want to travel. I didn't want to leave my family. I heard all these stories from Dad about not having Edward around when he was young, and I didn't want that to happen.","That's not to say that some day I won't go outside again, but I'm having a great time working on this process.","I'm not photographing the model in the classic sense; the model is playing a part in my photographs. It's more like theater. I always work with models I know, and I let them participate in deciding how to act their part."],"Kim Wilde":["People want performers, personality and drama, and you got that in the .","My life is so full of surprises, nothing surprises me any more.","My tears of love are a waste of time if I turn away.","You need a bit more to be a pop star than just a good voice.","Real talent will get through whatever the obstacles.","The record company really pissed me off when they told me to lose weight. I couldn't be bothered with looking a certain way. So I left the business. I don't regret it.","I signed up for the musical Tommy in the West End, where I met my husband.","Performing, I can take it or leave it. Horticulture is far more challenging. I'm absolutely fascinated by it.","I got to show off in front of my husband, who married me as I was stepping out of the business, so he had no idea that I could strut my stuff on the stage.","Careers don't seem to be built up in the same way as they were in the 80s.","I still tune in to the radio and listen to pop music and enjoy it as much as I ever have.","I was very, very fortunate. I knew that. I've always known that.","I didn't spend much time in America, which probably was a mistake. To someone else, having a number one in America would be enough to get them touring.","Dad is my best mate and I can tell Mum absolutely anything. I really appreciate Mum and Dad. Why are we so close? Young parents, I think. The rock business keeps their minds young.","Sex does not exist for me at all. I haven't had a boyfriend for a long time. There were only three or four in my life up until now anyway.","My parents have a wonderful marriage, for many years. But I can't commit myself for such a long time.","When you're together with someone for some time, you will automatically depend on them as if they were a crutch. And then it ends.","My father has taught me all the tricks of the boys at an early age, which has made me very careful.","When I was 15, I was naive, looked like a grey mouse and felt second choice.","I do know what my family has done for me, but they do need to give me some space to let me be myself. There would be some things I would handle differently.","I want to conquer the world and it seems like my own family is putting a stop to that.","I don't take myself seriously any more. Sometimes I just garden in my knickers and platform shoes."],"Kim Young-ha":["Don't be a fish; be a frog. Swim in the water and jump when you hit ground.","When the moon covers the sun, we have a solar eclipse. What do you call it when birds do that?","South Korea first allowed women into the military in 1950 during the Korean War. Back then, female soldiers mainly held administrative and support positions. Women began to take on combat roles in the 1990s when the three military academies, exclusive to men, began accepting women.","The moment kids start to lie is the moment storytelling begins. They are talking about things they didn't see. It's amazing. It's a wonderful moment. Parents should celebrate. 'Hurray! My boy finally started to lie!' All right! It calls for celebration.","We are all born artists. If you have kids, you know what I mean. Almost everything kids do is art. They draw with crayons on the wall.","Handwritten political posters - often composed in an artless and unadorned style, usually just words on plain white paper - were ubiquitous in South Korea in the 1970s and 1980s and were one of the few outlets available for expressing political views. Most posters were anonymous and put up under the cover of night.","We don't know why we should be artists, but we have many reasons why we can't be.","Where I teach students in drama school, there's a course called Dramatics. In this course, all students must put on a play. However, acting majors are not supposed to act. They can write the play, for example, and the writers may work on stage art. Likewise, stage art majors may become actors, and in this way you put on a show.","In 2013, Samsung accounted for about 20 percent of South Korea's total business profits. Samsung Electronics, just one of scores of subsidiaries, accounts for close to 15 percent of the total shares in the South Korean stock market. But you don't need to know these figures to get a feel for Samsung's hold on the country.","A military career offers the stability many South Korean women crave.","One must live the way one thinks or end up thinking the way one has lived.","From the early 1960s to the mid-1980s - the era of military dictatorship when South Korea was rebuilding itself from a postwar economic basket case to a humming, modern nation - military schools were the track of choice for ambitious young men.","Just like any other company, Samsung can fail, and if that happens, how will the South Korean economy overcome the shock? If we don't decrease our over-reliance on the chaebols and prepare to let smaller, dynamic start-ups fill the gaps in their place, it won't.","The constant movement of a military life can be tough on children. My father was an officer in the army, and I was forced to change elementary schools six times.","In the early 2000s, people expected that anonymity on the Internet would be positive for the development of democracy in South Korea. In a Confucian culture like South Korea's, hierarchy can block the free exchange of opinions in face-to-face situations. The web offered a way around that.","In my 20s, I became obsessed with the role-playing game 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms,' named after a classical Chinese novel, and later 'The Sims,' a life-simulation game, and 'StarCraft,' a science-fiction game.","It's an open secret: Even now, in the 21st century, Korean executives often consult spiritual advisers before making major business decisions - decisions that can affect their employees around the world.","For all the popularity of spiritual advisers in South Korea, it still shocks to see the leaders of huge public companies relying on fortune-tellers. A shaman may advise a struggling executive to move a building's front entrance, tapping the widespread pungsu belief that your luck depends on the direction of your house.","When the head of the Hyundai Motor Company, Chung Mong-koo, was fighting with his younger brother Chung Mong-hun over the company's management, he is said to have consulted a fortune-teller.","Of John Le Carre's books, I've only read 'The Spy Who Came In From The Cold,' and I haven't read anything by Graham Greene, but I've heard a great deal about how 'Your Republic Is Calling You' reminded English readers of those two writers. I don't really have any particular interest in Cold War spy novels.","When I wrote 'Your Republic Is Calling You,' it was Franz Kafka's writing that I had most in mind, and James Joyce's 'Ulysses.' Entirely out of the blue, Kafka's characters receive an order to go somewhere, and when they try to comply, they never quite manage it. Ki-yong in 'Your Republic Is Calling You' is precisely that sort of character.","I like to take certain aspects of genre fiction and modify them in my own way. 'Your Republic Is Calling You' follows the form of a spy novel, but it leads readers into a world of Kafkaesque irrationality.","The most difficult thing about living as a writer is precisely 'having to write.' Pretending to be a writer is easy. Living freely, reading many books, going on frequent trips, cultivating minor eccentricities... but genuinely being a writer is difficult, because you have to write something that will convince both yourself and readers.","Here's a question we all ask ourselves at least once when we're young: Where does that starlight come from? It's been there before I was born, and before my grandmother, and her grandmother were born. So just how far is that star from Earth?"],"Kim Young-sam":["The blood and sweat shed by United States and United Nations troops proved to be the prime mover behind the realisation of freedom throughout the post-war period.","It's very certain that North Korea is developing nuclear weapons for offensive purposes. They don't need nuclear weapons to defend their own country.","All of North Korea is a jail.","Once a major military confrontation occurs, North Korea will definitely be annihilated.","I don't think the current regime of South Korea will deal actively with the issue of North Korean defectors.","I feel very sorry for the one or two North Korean defectors who were caught by Chinese police while entering South Korean or foreign embassies in Beijing, but their arrest drew the whole attention of the world.","To Koreans on the other side, we care about your freedom.","In my day, the president ruled with authority before the law, but now all that is lost.","No doubt it was better to have become president than not.","The stark reality facing us today is that without the labour reforms, workers will get neither the income nor jobs in the face of cut-throat global economic competition."],"Kim Yuna":["What I miss the most is chatting with my friends and family and having a good laugh over a simple meal.","Building a better life for every child is a lot harder than becoming a world champion. Both goals take dedication and commitment.","Even in the hardest circumstances, dreams can give you the courage to live, and I hope I can share that message with children in need.","To many, peace is what enables development and is critical in providing opportunities to young people. To some - especially those from regions involved in conflict - peacekeeping and efforts to preserve peace are absolutely vital in bringing prosperity and hope for the future.","When I was young, many people didn't know what figure skating was. Some who knew of it thought of it as dancing on ice. But, as I entered international competitions and got good results, many people got to know more about it and came to cheer for me.","For a long time, just skating in the Olympics had been my goal because not many Koreans had done it.","I get tired too, just like everybody else. Sometimes I tell people that, but all I get is people saying that being vulnerable and weak is just not like me. I rarely get the response of emotional support I want. But sometimes I need it.","I am not trying my best because it is the Olympics. I try my best always.","What motivated me is skating is something I am best at and I love the most.","I love figure skating. It's what I'm good at.","I have been compared to Mao since we were both junior skaters. We've felt the rivalry since then, so we wanted to avoid each other. However, she has been my motivation.","Where there is peace, there is sports; where there is sports, there is peace. Peace is what allows us, especially young people, to dream, go after one's goals and prepare you for the next challenge in life.","The Olympics is the biggest competition for all athletes and an unforgettable event.","I've been dreaming of winning gold medal in the Olympics.","Korean audiences are amazing. The fans scream so loud, and that really surprises skaters when they first perform in my shows.","My coaches have told me my muscles and body structure are perfect for skating.","Watching previous figure skaters, I always wondered why they cried after their performance.","L.A. is a city that has given me great support for skating.","I always wanted to be Olympic champion and do clean programs.","I love weekends. Just like everyone else, I get to rest on weekends and go out with friends. I hate Mondays.","I like to be just an athlete, but if I go to competition and compete, I love to be a star, maybe.","The Vancouver Olympics was the first competition where I completed the short and free programs without any mistakes, and that in itself was a huge achievement.","After I won the Olympics, like any gold medalist, I did feel some emptiness in my heart. I did think about coming back to the ice for a long time. What motivated me is skating is something I am best at and I love the most. So I want to give it one more try.","People expect that I'll be just perfect on ice, and that's not the case. I make mistakes, too. When I review my performance, sometimes I feel I did awful. That's the whole part of the process of what people see when I'm performing.","When I came back on the rink in 2012, I set a goal of wrapping up my career well rather than just winning medals. I'm not preparing for any special skills for Sochi because I don't feel like they are necessary.","I'm not feeling much pressure for the Olympics because I think I already have done many things in my career. I will try to enjoy my second Olympics.","For an athlete myself, it is especially meaningful for our country to host an Olympics. Every athlete hopes to participate in an Olympics, so I still can't believe the games of dreams is going to take place in Korea.","I had trouble finding my next goal after winning a gold medal at the Vancouver Olympics, but the interest of the public and my fans in me got even bigger. I wanted to get away from the pressure, even for a single day.","If I give up my career as a skater simply because I fear I won't show my best performance, I would be really sorry later in life.","I always thought the Vancouver Olympics would be my last destination, but I'm extending it to Sochi... I want to start anew, not as an Olympic medalist but just as yet another figure skater.","The Sochi Games is not only my second Olympics, but the 'retirement stage' for me, so I want to have a greater experience than any other competition before. In the past, I had strong concepts for short programs and lyrical ones for the long. But this time, it's the other way around.","A coach told my mum I had talent and I would make a very good skater.","If I walk in the street in Korea, I am recognized.","In Toronto and Los Angeles, too, there are a lot of Koreans - Koreatown, Korean markets. I feel like I'm at home and very comfortable.","In competition, when I start performance I try not to think about all the pressure from the fans. But, I got a lot of energy from them always. They make me more perfect.","I decided to host my show 'Kiss and Cry' hoping that people actually want to participate and feel more familiar with figure skating. When I see these people enjoying themselves, it's a great joy to me. Although some of them get hurt once in a while, they enjoy it a lot, and I hope the show makes the viewers want to give it a try.","Peace is what enables development and is critical in providing opportunities to young people. Efforts to preserve peace are absolutely vital in bringing prosperity and hope for the future.","I have learned from the first Olympics, of course. When I went to my first Olympic Games, I experienced all of the pressure and was able to win the gold medal. I try not to feel the pressure, and I try not to be nervous when I am on the ice and when I compete.","When I was little, I had never really expected to win such a big competition. For a long time, just skating in the Olympics had been my goal because not many Koreans had done it.","I think I'm a born athlete. My coaches have told me my muscles and body structure are perfect for skating.","I trained for four years in Toronto, and even before that, I was back and forth between Canada and the States during summer for training. And, since there isn't much difference between Canada and the States, I haven't felt much difference in the environment.","Because winning a gold medal had been a dream of mine since a young age, I needed to empty my mind during the preparation for the Olympics by telling myself that it would be OK not to win a gold medal.","The thought of having the expectations of the whole country on my shoulders worried and unnerved me.","If, by any chance, I get to perform, then it would be a great honor for me. Especially because performing in the Olympics in your country doesn't happen to many skaters.","Many people talk about winning two straight gold medals, but I'm not focusing on defending the title.","For the off-ice training, I do basic strength training, and for the on-ice training, I practice jumps, spins, steps, and my new long program with my new coach Peter Oppegard.","During my early skating years, there were not many ice rinks in Korea, and even the few rinks that existed, most of them were public.","The popularity of figure skating has increased tremendously, and Koreans have a huge interest in figure skaters - not only me, other international skaters as well."],"Kimbal Musk":["Strong communities are built around local, real food. Food we trust to nourish our bodies, the farmer and planet.","The idea behind fast food is great - people want convenience.","We want kids in communities to know real food, and we want them to have a choice between real food and industrial food.","Tesla Motor's original business plan had a copy of a letter from Nikola Tesla from the late 19th century talking about the challenges inherent in gasoline engines and the promise of the electric engine.","When you have the demand, you can change the government policies that create McDonald's and junk food.","The hard part about following your purpose is the distraction everyone pulls you toward.","We want kids to value real food and understanding that it isn't just about feeding people but about nourishing the body, the community and the planet.","If you're a vegan fast food joint in L.A., you just don't speak the same language as the heartland.","The problem is that restaurants have assumed that kids don't want to eat anything other than chicken nuggets or fast-food burgers, but they do. They want to eat things that taste good.","Boulder was not the small town I had expected. It is a vivacious community of sophisticated people, who have the same aspirations and expectations you find in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco.","I was very afraid of failure because if you fail at something you love, then you ruin what you love.","People are overweight and starving at the same time. It's a tragedy for both the individual and society.","The industrial food system ships in high-calorie, low-nutrient, processed food from thousands of miles away. It leaves us disconnected from our food and the people who grow it.","As a kid, I'd never have avocado. You'd get some melon and the odd fresh peach. But avocados? Mangoes? I'd never had a mango in my life.","Twenty-first-century food is going to be real food. Real food is food that is truly nourishing for the consumer, the community, and the planet.","Newspapers have an extraordinary amount of local content, including real estate listings and restaurant reviews.","Food never ends. It's one of the greatest things about working on food - we're always going to need food.","My advice for any entrepreneur or innovator is to get into the food industry in some form so you have a front-row seat to what's going on.","The problem with industrial food is zero transparency. The system thrives on the fact that there is no transparency.","Microwave sales have plateaued as people realize that reheated TV dinners give us no joy.","We want to replace all the T.G.I. Friday's, Applebee's - at a price point that is arguably even lower than those guys.","It's pretty rough in South Africa. It's a rough culture. Imagine rough - well, it's rougher than that.","Back in 1995, I saw an incredible wave coming. The Internet. I knew I needed to be a part of it no matter what I did.","Food is the new Internet.","I went to New York to train as a chef, and I had the good or bad fortune, depending on how you describe it, of being right there during 9/11. It was one of the best and the worst experiences.","We have been growing more food than we need since the '60s... what we have is a terrible distribution problem.","The problem is not actual number of calories we are producing - we have food waste issues. The problem is industrial food.","The Kitchen's mission is to strengthen communities by bringing local, real food to everyone.","We want our communities to know what real food is.","If you've ever done something you love and go do something you like, it's like chewing on sawdust.","If you come to The Kitchen and get a pork chop with polenta, which is our kind of food - simple - there is only one way it should taste at The Kitchen.","Our family are all very hard working.","My goal is to go from the industrial food system toward a real food system where you understand what you are eating.","My family were all entrepreneurs, including my parents and grandparents.","My mother was a consulting dietician, and my father was a consulting engineer.","I did a business in a box called College Pro Painters. They taught you how to paint houses, how to hire and fire, how to sell, how to deal with customers. You got a one-year franchise. It was the hardest year of my life in terms of hard work. I won manager of the year. It was very successful.","Boulder should be next to the word 'community' in the dictionary.","The support we received at OneRiot from the beginning has been amazing. Everyone's door was open, and everyone was rooting for our success. In turn, our team at OneRiot has done everything we can to return the favor.","The Kitchen, which my wife and I opened with our friend and amazing chef Hugo Matheson, was quickly recognized as the pioneer in 'green' restaurants across the country.","Nikola Tesla, one of Colorado's famous residents, always believed that the gasoline engine made no sense.","But for a few twists of fate, the gasoline engine we know today might have just been a small footnote in history.","Nikola Tesla spent one of his most productive years in Colorado Springs.","I have always loved food, and for me, even if I was on a beach, I would be cooking food every day.","My brother is about energy. SpaceX is his passion, and I love being a part of that company. Energy is where he spends a lot of his time and thinking in terms of having an impact on the world.","For me, creating a supply chain of what we should be eating is incredibly complicated. It's complicated to figure out how to change the food system in America.","The one lesson I've learned from technology and food is the only time you know you're doing the wrong thing is when you're doing what everyone else is doing.","I was totally humbled by how hard it is to create a product every day that needs to be made from scratch.","I had this attitude, that Silicon Valley obnoxious attitude, that I know what I'm doing, and the rest was going to be pretty easy.","No one wins in the industrial food system.","Growing up, I cooked in the house, and when I cooked, everyone would sit down and eat, and it was just kind of the way I connected with my family.","I used to throw cooking parties in university. Everyone would come over - sometimes you'd just do a mac and cheese, but if you do that better than everyone else, you can get people to come to you.","When you think about basketball, and you watch someone like Michael Jordan play basketball - even if you're a baseball player, there's still a lot to learn from there.","I'm going to work on food culture and help food become fun and part of peoples' lives again. The traditional restaurant is more commercial-oriented. But I want community through food.","Kids gave Elon a very hard time, and it had a huge impact on his life.","The best training ground in the world is Silicon Valley and the tech space.","You bring people together with food. You connect them and tie the fabric of society together through food.","Anyone who thinks restaurants are hard should try working at a tech company.","At Tesla, we don't go into a community and think we're going to sell one or two cars.","We're social beings, and food is one of the things we can use three times a day to connect with family or with friends.","A lot of people think about food as fuel, where you need to get nutrients in your body.","I really believe that people don't have to eat healthy; they just have to know what they are eating, and then they'll eat better. That is really the movement we are behind.","People love to interact in real time, whether it is with each other or with content.","Users are open to ads as long as they're relevant to their realtime experience.","Advertisers really want to create ads that are relevant to the realtime experience.","Realtime ads are the perfect way for an advertiser to connect with users in a social environment.","The question is not 'Why advertise in realtime?' The question is, 'Who are the brands and businesses that are going to be built off the realtime web?'","Using realtime ads, even mortgage companies can create ads that matter to you right now.","Publishers can use realtime ad technology to build their brand on the realtime web. Realtime ad technology gets their hottest content in front of users seconds after it is published, ensuring that their content gets shared and becomes viral before their competitors.","Square Roots creates campuses of climate-controlled, indoor, hydroponic vertical farms, right in the hearts of our biggest cities.","I joined the board of Chipotle because no company has ever been able to scale fresh, properly sourced food in the history of America.","Community through food is my mission; it is what I do.","It is an interesting thing. Every time I try and stray from the path of food, I get whacked.","Young people, especially, are turning away from McDonald's towards healthy, locally-sourced options like Next Door and Sweetgreen.","We're moving to be more of a plant-based society.","People want real food. The demand for it is through the roof.","The reality is that we connect through food, and we have the opportunity to do it three times a day.","The Kitchen was a really great concept; it just wasn't at the price point that made it accessible to people. People could visit occasionally, and some people were coming regularly. It just wasn't a novel concept for every customer.","After I broke my neck, I began thinking more about The Kitchen: How can we come up with some way to make real food more affordable? Food that's locally-grown, if possible, fundamentally nourishing to the body, nourishing to the planet.","It's only a risk if you think there's a chance of failure.","As a South African, the idea of turkey was new to me. And confusing. It's about the least flavorful bird on the planet.","You should brine your turkey. Don't even think about not brining your turkey.

The short answer is, 'We're creating community through food.' That's the big idea we had, the product we're exporting. And it has paid off.","Building one garden in L.A. - it might be a nice gesture - but it won't make a difference. We have to start to change the culture of the community.","Memphis is a vibrant and diverse city that is on the verge of a Real Food renaissance. We are more than thrilled to be part of that movement by investing in the Crosstown and Shelby Farms Park developments.","Young people contact me all the time to articulate issues with the industrial food system, but they are frustrated by their perceived inability to do anything about it.","It's relatively easy to set up a tech company, join an accelerator, and progress down a pathway towards success. It's more complex to do that with food.","We get emails from parents asking us what kale is because their kids are asking for it. That kind of extraordinary presence in the community is critical to the future of real food.","We already solved the problem of feeding the world in the 1960s, when we started serving cheeseburgers.","Everyone has to eat, so the opportunities in the space are incredible."],"Kimberley Nixon":["By the time you're 18, 19, you know yourself, and you shouldn't go against your gut feeling, which is a temptation in the first year of university.","I absolutely love 'Four In A Bed.'

When I get home after being in Manchester or London for a bit, I forget how dark the sky is, and I won't have seen stars for ages.","I've got six brothers, so I grew up with all boys, then I moved in with three girls, and the differences were incredible. Living in a very feminine house threw me a bit. The bathroom was unbelievable; it was like a chemist's.","A lot of my background is in theatre, so when you're on location, and the wind is really blowing, it's raining, and you've got mud all over you, it really keeps you on your toes.","I went to the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama, which was great but very different from a typical university. They sat us down in the first week and said: if you want to party, you've come to the wrong place. There was no lie-ins or skipping lectures.","I'm very impatient, and if I get a new piece of technology, no matter what it is - I recently got the iPhone, which is very exciting - I can't be doing with reading manuals. I want it to work immediately and to do what I want it to do.","I think I'd like my own plane, stacked with all my favourite films.","I hadn't done comedy before 'Fresh Meat' - I hadn't really been seen that way, and then 'Fresh Meat' came out, and suddenly a lot more comedy scripts were coming my way, which was really great.","I had always sort of done dramatic things, and I love them; it's my background. But when I think about 'Fresh Meat,' I just think about the cast and the crew that we had... we just had a great time.","Sometimes when you film, you can be in a bit of a bubble, and then suddenly when you finish filming, it's taken out of your hands - it's not yours anymore, and we all love it so much that we feel quite protective of it.","I absolutely adore Agatha Christie; so much so that when I received a kitten for my Christmas present, I called her Agatha, and I already have a cat called Hercule!","When I first started out, I absolutely begged my agent to get me a Poirot audition, and my wish came true - I did a Poirot! I need to do a Marple to round it off.","I'd just got back from filming my role as Flo in 'Kidnap & Ransom' when I got the news that Channel 4 had re-commissioned 'Fresh Meat,' so I think it was the first Christmas I could actually relax knowing that I had three months' work sorted. As an actor, that's always a good feeling.","I love meeting up with friends and just doing 'normal' stuff like going to the cinema.","I'm the first actress in the family, but when I'm home, I'm just Kimberley.","I knew I wanted to be an actress, but I hadn't ever really told anyone. I'd always got quite good grades, so people assumed I would go and do a 'normal' job. My dad took me to my first audition for drama school and picked me up without anyone knowing, really.","My character in 'Fresh Meat' is quite prim and tidy, and then I basically had no make-up for the whole shoot of 'Kidnap and Ransom' - apart from a bit of Vaseline to make me look even sweatier!","In my last year of drama school, I was Abigail in 'The Crucible' and Nina in 'The Seagull,' and I did some Shakespeare with the RSC. That's what casting directors saw me in, and I got put up for a lot of period drama auditions. I always get told I suit the costumes. I don't think I have a very modern-looking face.","I get mistaken for Amanda Holden; I've had that since I was 12. I get Carey Mulligan, too. We look quite similar, and she does 'Bleak House' and I do 'Cranford,' so people mix us up. I'm sure we'll play sisters at some point.","I thought every other kid was like me. I'd watch films and act them out on my own and wish I could be one of the actresses. When I saw 'Pride And Prejudice,' the one with Colin Firth, I just absolutely knew that was what I wanted to do, and for 'Cranford' to be my first job was poetic, really.","Growing up, we used to watch a lot of 'Indiana Jones' and 'Star Wars' and wear hand-me-down jeans and jumpers. I wasn't really one for dresses.","I have six brothers, and in the past I've done quite a few girlie films, like 'Wild Child' and 'Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging' - so when they've been to those, they've been incredibly embarrassed. They won't be embarrassed going to see 'Black Death' - I reckon they're going to love it.","Even though we know the origin of diseases, panic sweeps. It's one thing that frightens us, because it's your health and your body - it's more like a tangible threat; it's not like a foreign enemy you can fight. That was really what was uppermost to many of us whilst making 'Black Death.'"],"Kimberly Bryant":["Few of my classmates looked like me. While we shared similar aspirations and many good times, there's much to be said for making any challenging journey with people of the same cultural background.","I loved school, was an exceptional student, and found a passion for math and science that led me to Vanderbilt University, where I discovered the world of electrical engineering. I did well in college, loved the work I was doing, and soon found myself climbing the corporate ladder after graduation. I was one of the lucky ones.","If I understood the great opportunities that are available to women and underrepresented minorities in the field of tech I would have made the transition from traditional engineering to the technology field much earlier in my career.","I'm horrendous at capturing a decent selfie.","While there should be collective efforts to increase tech inclusion overall, the industry must work to specifically attract and retain women of color.","I did not grow up around computers, so technology was not a tool used every day in my household. I was drawn to computer science due to the creative nature of programming and the technology focus.","We understand bringing girls into the tech space is about giving them skills to create social impact and change in their community.","I had been tracked from grades 1 through 12 in an accelerated program in the public school system in Memphis and had done well in math and science classes. When I was getting ready for college, my guidance counselors suggested I look into engineering.","As the coding movement continues to grow, the common narrative of the white male geek as the predominant influencer on geek culture will erode.","Technology is a ubiquitous part of our everyday lives, and the accompanying geeky lexicon has infiltrated every facet of our modern day society.","We like to say we hope to be like the Girl Scouts of technology, having many different chapters in many different states as well as many different countries.","Girls who participate in Black Girls Code think of themselves as leaders.","You cannot possibly be reaching the needs of your consumers when the makeup of your company is not reflective of the community you serve.","We're creating this new breed of techies who are going to be the ones starting the tech companies of the future.","There's not enough said about the beauty of being able to focus on what you do well.","If people are not tied to the work from a mission-driven focus, I don't think you're going to motivate them.","I think my biggest mistake was deciding not to go to law school directly after I graduated from college.","It's always been my dream to be an attorney, and I'm that weird breed of human being that loves being in a courtroom.","As a little girl growing up in the Deep South, my mother told me that my future lay in my education. And she was right.","I didn't want my daughter to feel culturally isolated in the pursuit of her studies as I had as a young girl. I didn't want her to give up on her passions just because she didn't see anyone else like her in the classroom.","Women and girls are naturally agents of change. If we teach one girl to code, she will go on to teach more - we've seen this in our own programs and workshops around the country.","I don't think that the trickle-down theory of diversity ever really works.","For me, if a company is really committed to diversity, that means everything. That means gender diversity, that means sexual orientation for me, that means race, ethnicity.","One of the biggest lessons that we hope to model for several folks, including some of the young women of color who come to me, is the value of understanding your worth, standing up, and demanding the best for yourself and not taking less.","For me, as a woman in one of the less diverse fields - electrical engineering, which is what I studied in college - it was hard to persist and really build a career. Some of the things I experienced were really scary, and they weren't experiences that I wanted for my daughter.","I was doing a lot of networking in the Valley, and I found that it was not a very diverse environment, and most of the conferences and meetup events I went to, there weren't many women or people of color in those rooms.","Some of the perceptions from my professors were that I was less than or that I wouldn't be able to compete or wouldn't be able to meet the same bar as my peers. I don't want that for my daughter or for any of the girls who come into our program.","We really pride ourselves on the notion that what makes our program special is that we really do our very best to make sure that everything we do is culturally responsive and relevant.","You can absolutely be what you can't see! That's what innovators and disruptors do.","Technology can be biased in how it's developed if coders aren't careful. There are apps that are clearly made by companies with no people of color on their team.","By reaching out to the community through workshops, hackathons, and after-school programs, Black Girls Code introduces computer programming and technology to girls from underrepresented communities.","Gender is not central to coding.","Girls are almost always socialized to be perfect: 'Smile, do well in school, don't take too many risks.'","We need to have women as role models, both inside and outside corporate America's leading tech companies, leading the path for other women.","We want to teach girls of color the skills they need and create a diversity of voices into the tech community.","When I started Black Girls Code in 2011, there weren't any programs that had a foundation in communities of color to teach our kids about technology.","If technology is designed mostly by white males, who make up roughly half our population, we're missing out on the innovation, solutions, and creativity that a broader pool of talent can bring to the table.","I do believe that most startups who develop applications and digital products design 'towards the middle.' By this, I mean they design their products to reach the broadest consumer base possible, which is a sound strategy in some respects.","We want to create a community of girls who will be empowered to become catalysts for transformation in their communities.","Our camps and workshops offer a space where girls of color can learn computer science and coding principles alongside their peers, with mentorship from female role models who have established themselves in tech fields where women, and minority women in particular, tend to be underrepresented.","While there is still certainly much more work that needs to be done, Lyft actually believes in increasing diversity and inclusion within their workforce, and also, they believe in being a strong supporter of that in the community.","We want to see companies making a good faith effort and putting some tangible initiatives behind their pledge for diversity.","My first introduction to computers and computer programming came during my freshman year of college. I majored in electrical engineering with a minor in computer science, so I learned during my required courses at Vanderbilt University.","Women are both talented and innovative thinkers and tend to use computer science as a tool to solve larger problems.","I hope to literally change the world with Black Girls Code by changing the paradigm which produces the current monolithic ecosystem in technology.","When you've already experienced great challenges in your career, it gives minor setbacks a different perspective.","It's critical for girls to see role models like myself that are in technical fields. Looking for ways to come in as speakers or do a career day, or just find a way to connect with students or invite students to their workplaces to shadow them for the day... is critically important.","The images you see in media are vital to impacting not just what the world sees in terms of who can be a computer scientist, who can be techie, who can be a geek or who can be a creator; it also impacts the girls and what they internalize.","I think that if companies build for diversity from the beginning from the ground up, that's definitely the ideal state for how to build diversity into your company.","I don't think quotas are necessarily an evil. I think when we look at industry in general back to the '60s and the '50s, the way more diverse people like my dad and mom's generation were able to break into industry was because of affirmation action, because of quotas.","Jobs in technology have the rapidest rate of growth. The need for computer science is so incredibly large, and it's important that girls of all colors have the opportunity to move into that field.","We need to really focus on getting this digital equity across the board in all of our public school systems, for both girls and boys.","We are not generally included in that narrative - people of color - definitely, women of color don't normally fit that narrative that has been built around the whole image and the whole story of the Silicon Valley.","Although we use a lot of technology and consume a lot of technology as people of color, we're usually not the ones at the tables doing the creating of it.","I believe it is incredibly important for women and people of color to become the builders and creators in technology. In order to do so, we need to know how to code or, at least, know the language of coding - what I like to call 'code speak.'","I definitely think there needs to be more of a focus and movement on getting coding taught in schools. There's really only so much after-school programs like Black Girls Code can do to really drive that change. And those classes shouldn't only take place in high school. We should make sure that we teach kids about coding at an early age.","I'm looking to see more women of color not only in companies in technology, but also creating companies.","Our goal is to really have young women of color embrace the tech marketplace and the tech innovation space as both leaders and creators.","I had originally wanted to be a lawyer. Even when I went to college and majored in engineering, I still thought I'd get a law degree. Then I started taking electrical engineering classes where I saw some of the innovation happening around computers and solid-state technology in the mid '80s.","I grew up in a close-knit community where I was expected to excel, and it was a different experience when I got to the university. There were very few students of color, and those numbers were extremely low in the school of engineering."],"Kimberly Caldwell":["I take all of my life lessons, which some people might call 'mistakes,' and apply them to my future so that I keep growing.","It's totally weird to see myself on a billboard!","Well, I love tattoos and have been drawing them on my binders in school since I was little.","Sometimes I'll flip through a magazine and do a double take when I see myself in it, it's just crazy!","I juggle a lot of different balls and sometimes I don't know how I manage to keep them all up in the air, but I do!","I wear a lot of black, but not in the goth way, I just really love black. I'll never be in pink or purples.","I'm a huge shoe person, and I have lots of shoes.","I don't do earrings.","I like things in my hair - big feather pieces.","I started singing at age five and haven't stopped since.","I love every kind of music.","The people that go on 'American Idol' do want some recognition and fame.","I never thought I would become a television host, but I never thought anybody would pay me to just talk."],"Kimberly Elise":["A solid sense of self will help a person to lead a full and happy life.","I live a very joyful life, with a lot of laughter and good times.","Whatever it is that I feel, I express it! I am free with my joy, my laughter, my pleasure, my pain, and I am blessed in that way as an actress that I can access those feelings within myself and not be ashamed to show whatever that is that's appropriate for the character.","I have the right to shine my light! That's what all women have. Once you own that, you can almost always shine your light.","I always look at things half full and definitely see a change in how things are going as far as black actresses and their opportunities.","It's what I tell my daughters: Know that your birthright is to shine your light, and don't let anybody deny you of that right. Take responsibility for your life.","Believe it or not, I loved my Jheri curl and thought it was beautiful on me. It actually made my hair grow like crazy. What they didn't tell you back then was that once you get the Jheri curl, there's no way of getting rid of it, so when I was over it, I ended up having to cut off all my hair and start all over again.","In my college days, I went wild with my hair. I dyed it every color in the book and, quite naturally, my hair would break off from all the damage. When our hair breaks off, of course, there's only one thing to do - braid it up. I wore braids for a while and would always feel like I just never knew what to do with my hair.","I decided to start embracing and wearing my natural hair, but there was only one problem; I didn't know what to do with it or how to style it. Growing up, all I knew was my relaxed, processed hair, so I had to go through this learning phase.","I love seeing my mom and my daughter embrace their natural hair. I'm glad I've embraced it, too.","Thankfully, I was given a strong base by my parents, an understanding of who I was and my strength.","Hollywood is so governed by the ego, and I never wanted to fall into that trap.","I grew up an athlete. Track and field and dance. In track, I actually went to the Junior Olympics. I've always been very athletic.","I'm definitely in a place where I'm looking for different than what I've done in the past, just so I can go to work and do something I haven't done before.","If Judd Apatow called me, I'd do it without thinking about it. I think he does really fun movies.","'Beloved.' That's an amazing film and I'm sorry more people didn't see it when it came out.","I don't have to be glamorous all the time.","I watched Westerns from the time I was a girl. My dad was a big Western fan. I always loved Clint Eastwood movies and 'Westworld', where the guy gets trapped in a western-themed amusement park. The western motif was fascinating to me.","Making 'Beloved' was an awesome experience.","I'm very free with all my emotions, whether it's happy, sad, mad, glad, whatever.","I have a lot of compassion for human beings in life experiences, so I allow myself to feel what these characters are feeling and don't have a problem accepting that.","I can be dramatic. I can be funny. I can be sexy. I can be sad. I can be glad.","We need happy, productive citizens on our planet for us to survive.","Self-esteem is such a challenging issue for young women.","I am actually very in touch with all of my emotions, from joy to pain, and I am free with them.","It's funny because I never studied, I never took a class. So everything I do is very innate and organic; I don't really have words for it. It is a communion with spirit. I don't get in my own way and allow the character to do what it's going to do.","I like movies that resonate, that give voice to the voiceless."],"Kimberly Guilfoyle":["Work hard. Through determination and self-focus and discipline, you can accomplish anything.","I come from a strong woman who believed - and my father believed - that anything a man could do, a woman could do better.","I believe in people. Human beings, deep down, are essentially good. Any jury can filter through whatever bull might be thrown their way and use common sense to get to the truth of a case. Juries make the right decisions, almost unfailingly, because people know right from wrong.","Advocating for yourself in the context of friendship starts with choosing the right people to be part of your inner circle.","I've been in a lot of tough businesses: First Lady of San Fransciso, working as model, actress, TV host. You better have thick skin, for sure, but you also need to laugh at yourself. I make fun of myself all the time.","I just feel so blessed to have had the time that I had with my mother. She made it so impactful in terms of how she raised me and my little brother, the values that she instilled in us, the way she inspired us, and how she lived her everyday life.","When my mom, Mercedes, and her younger sister, Juanita, first came from Puerto Rico, they were the youngest in the family. They had to jump into a new community and really learn English, assimilate, and adapt - and I saw that. I grew up in that community.","If you put your mind to it, anything is possible.","I hold a mini-New Year's Eve party each year with my son Ronan, and we make pigs in a blanket. They are delicious!","There's nothing like the feeling of being in Times Square for New Year's Eve. It's such a great rush. You feel like the whole world is there. People from all over the world coming to celebrate together.","Everyone loves to feast their eyes on Times Square on New Year's Eve.","We cannot turn away because a topic is unpleasant or vile. Why? Because one way to rid our society of evil is to confront it boldly.","I would come here, too. Who doesn't want a free ride? I want to ride in the carnival for free all day long and put my whole family on welfare.","Often when I'm trying to make tough decisions, I rely on the lessons my father taught me and ask myself, 'What Would Tony Say?'","My point is you've been given a powerful blessing in life in this country to be able to vote and to be able to sit on the jury, so come equipped.","I really feel that I've carried on my mother's legacy.","In that portion of time where my parents were together, I got to see great love, great loyalty, and teamwork.","During the 10 years I worked as a prosecutor, I always struggled with what to do with someone who was clearly mentally ill and committed a horrific crime.","I enjoyed giving back to the city I was born and raised in.","Bella is my little dog. She's an imperial Shih Tzu. She's a little cotton ball with flecks of gold. She's super, super cute, and she eats like she's a Rottweiler.","I am a strong woman. I come from a background as a prosecutor.","I am at the table. I am first generation. I am Irish-Puerto Rican. I am a single mom.","Sure, our legal system has its flaws, but it is the best legal system in the world.","If it's something that you are opposed to or you don't want your children or family to see, then do not watch it, and the market can send a message.","Roger Ailes, he's incredible. He's the one that created 'The Five' and came up with the idea for it.","When I left the San Francisco DA's office, I went down to the Los Angeles district attorney's office, and I was able to try a tremendous amount - very serious cases and working in gang neighborhoods, impoverished neighborhoods - really make a difference and be impactful in those communities.","Making smart decisions on who to vote for is difficult.","Come prepared because you don't want to dilute the votes out there because you are uninformed and you're spoon-fed something that's inaccurate, or you don't even bother to equip yourself with the facts - anybody out there, this goes for everyone.","Bob Beckel and Juan Williams are two people who I love personally. But what they say drives me absolutely nuts.","I've tried to live my life in a way that respects the beliefs of my mother and father. Everyone has blessings, gifts, passion, and drive.","The key lesson for me: Don't make this life about you. It's about other people.","A friend is someone who has your back. Those in the military refer to it as, 'I got your six.' My closest friend on 'The Five' is Dana Perino.","I'm a very fertile Puerto Rican.","My most defining moment was the death of my mother.","My mother taught me early on not to be afraid to put myself out there - especially as a woman.","I grew up in the Mission District in San Francisco, which was largely Hispanic at the time. I was raised in a household that was really welcoming to diversity and encouraging about different people's viewpoints and ideas and backgrounds.","You really have to prove yourself and prove your worth. I didn't come from family that had been here for generations and had all these connections.","The one message I always send to young people is, Don't be afraid to try different things to see what feels right and what's a good fit.","What I think you need to do is be aware and be your own best advocate. Get on the Internet, do your research, and find a group that you might be able to get involved with.","The important thing is, you must give back. As good as you've been given, you must do for others as well. Somebody helped you. Who can you help, too?","I really saw my mom advocate on my behalf and really say, 'Hey, you're good enough.' It was from her that I learned that just because something hasn't been done before, it doesn't mean it can't be done now. You have to speak up, and you've got to assert yourself because it takes somebody to be the first one to make it happen.","Nobody was like, 'Kimberly, we're going to let you anchor general news or host a show or do any of that.' I at first started out doing legal analysis, but I had to make the case to my bosses... give me a shot, give me a chance, and I was able to do that: say, 'Let me fill in. Let me show you my range. Nothing to lose here - it's the holidays.'","God helps those who help themselves. You have blessings. You have gifts. You have passion. You have drive. Get after it; go in there and do something. Try and make every day count.","Talking about the loss of my parents... that was really, really difficult to go through.","Defendants would groan whenever they saw me enter a courtroom because I had a reputation for coming armed with the facts and for winning cases.","I think it's very insulting to say, 'White people don't understand.' What are you talking about? You're part of the problem then if you're... speaking and labeling all white people, saying they don't understand the issue or saying they can't relate. That's really not giving people much credit, is it?","You've got to be inclusive.","Nobody is going to believe what you're saying if you don't believe it yourself.","People can smell a fake.","If I was applying for a legal position, I would highlight my experience working for the San Francisco-L.A. DA's office, and I would mention some of the high-profile cases I did, but if I was looking for another television job, I would gloss over that, and I'd mention the highlight reel of what I did in television.","The friends I have from childhood are definitely like family to me - extended sisters and brothers, aunts and uncles.","I wish that young people, most of all, would learn to cut ties with those who make them feel bad about themselves or about the other people they love and care for.","Continual, intentional, or snarky putdowns have no place in a healthy relationship.","It doesn't matter if you're a man or a woman - stay alert and focused on your surroundings. Travel with friends. Know where you are at all times, and never let your guard down.","Sadly, as a seasoned prosecutor, I know what dark acts people are capable of.","We can be judged in many ways.","I think we need to update the existing laws to create uniformity across the states so that all people with mental illness who find themselves in the criminal justice system for committing horrific crimes will be treated exactly the same.","It is particularly challenging for women who are trying to stay competitive in a real estate market where men really don't have the same degree of safety concerns.","In any situation, it is good to be aware of even your co-workers, and if you are uncomfortable or concerned about a colleague's behavior, report it to a supervisor.","Both sides should demand a speedy trial.","At a very young age, my beloved mother passed away from leukemia, forcing my father to become a single dad. Rather than coddle me, shelter me, or do things for me, he taught me to 'Make the Case' for everything in life - from my first job to a graduation trip I wanted.","Putting yourself in a position to observe and work with the pros, whether you are paid or not, is key to helping you make the kinds of strides that set you out in front of the pack.","I knew myself. I knew where I wanted to go in life. I wanted to be the very best I could be in whatever I pursued.","No matter what stage of life you are graduating from or entering, learning how to build and state your case is something every person in the world should know how to do.","I'm a patriot... Like my late father who came here and served his country as a member of the U.S. Army.","I would be flattered and honored to be considered for any position where I could serve my country.","I love working for Fox News, and I feel like I play for the Yankees every day. I'm with the best lineup in the business.","I know the Trump family personally, his kids and grandkids, and they're a fantastic family.","The NYPD, they're the finest in the world.","I think Alzheimer's is an important cause.","Nobody wants to take a hard look of the entitlement system to see what it is.","I greatly admire Justice Thomas. I think he is incredible, and he is very humble. He is rarely heard from. But his spoken word is powerful. He's an example of everything that is right about this country, just like with Ben Carson.","It's not just teachers, but coaches are helping to shape the young people of tomorrow.","I have never done anything in my life that my mother would not have approved of or been proud of.","I believe it is my job to do everything I can so that everyone in our society feels safe, feels that justice is not an abstract concept but a fact of life for all Americans.","I don't mind people writing about me. Personal attacks are different, but political arguments? I'm putting myself out there on a daily basis. I'm giving my opinion. So it only makes sense that others might differ and will criticize me.","My second husband, Eric Villency, is the father of my beautiful boy Ronan Anthony. Even though we're divorced, I'm still very close with his family.","Even when people don't stay married, they can still be a family together. That's been something that's been really good for developing me as a person. It's been a very positive learning experience."],"Kimberly Quinn":["In a funny way, when things went wrong in my life - and it is my fault that they went wrong, it is not anyone else's fault - and all the glittering outside things were taken away, I was left with the things of most value.","Whether they hail from different cultures, countries or faiths, children are children.","Parents matter, buildings count, curriculum choices, materials, resources - all these things are important in a top-class education. But, in the end, it comes down to the teachers.","I think what happens when there's a scandal in your life, the things you depended on are taken away from you, and so you value what you have. I had two very nice little boys, so sweet, and a very good husband.","I've come to realise that the best teachers never stop being teachers.","God has his plan, and I'm just going along with it.","My career's consisted of all of those things that you hope would one day lead to being a series regular, and then your dreams grow from there. My career has been very steady, and I've been blessed in that I've been given everything that I can handle, at the right time.","I have a 4-year-old and a 14-year-old, and think I missed a recital and a graduation, and they were like 'It's OK mommy, we'll take pictures.' It was my upset, though... they were just fine! I just give them a kiss and a hug and let them know that I love them every day.","I come from a highly moral family. I was very much taught what was right and wrong, and in my perception of things, I did something that was very wrong. To know that, and to then be so publicly exposed, was very hard.","I had a husband who stayed with me, and small children, and I had no choice but to pull myself together and rebuild a different kind of life. There was no other choice.","When there has been a problem in your marriage, you cannot forever go on thinking, 'I am the most terrible person in the world and he is the most wonderful person.' You cannot live in a marriage that is unequal, because after a while, you are just worn out.","My mother wanted a conservative, secure life, and she has been married to my father since she was 18... A lot of hard work went into that marriage and a lot of not getting what you want.","My children are the thing that make life work because, you know, I screwed up my life, and I know it was me, and it was really hard because it was so public, and that was very, very hard."],"Kimberly Schlapman":["My personal decorating style is cozy, romantic and a little rustic, with a sense of whimsy.","As weird as it may seem, I enjoy doing laundry and watering my plants, very normal things like that.","Southern food certainly carries a stereotype, but I feel like that's turning around a little. There are great Southern chefs who are finding ways to showcase our traditional recipes in deliciously healthy ways. For me, the key is to use fresh fruits and vegetables and cut some of the butter and fat without sacrificing the yumminess of the dish.","My hubby makes a mean salmon steak at the grill, but he leaves all the sides up to me. I love to grill and roast vegetables. I also experiment with baking instead of frying some things, like onion rings. I even make biscuits with coconut oil these days.","In the South, I think, food mirrors our lives. When I was growing up, no matter what you were grieving or celebrating, my mama would be at the door with a cake or a pie.","When I was a child, I pretended that I had my own cooking show. I would stand at the kitchen counter with an empty bowl and spoon and talk in a silly voice, explaining the concoction I was creating.","My family is my greatest priority, but I'm committed to Little Big Town, and I have to make that a priority also.","It's so important in marriage to let the little things go and let the pride go. Forgiveness is so important, and communication. Don't major on the minors.","On the road, almost every day I'll do 100 squats, or sometimes I might do 50 squats and a bunch of leg lifts. I'll split them up right before I get in the shower and before I go to bed, or sometimes I'll do all 100 at once. Whatever I do, I try to get those in.","I need to have small morsels of sweets. If I have a day with the fam with a big family dinner, then I'll indulge... but then the next day or two I'll really be strict. I learned that from Dolly Parton, by the way!","My daughter loves to cook. At first, I found myself making her be really neat and precise. Then I realized it's OK if things get all over the floor and counters and ceiling. We're making memories.","Whenever anyone asked me what I'd do if I wasn't a singer, I'd say, 'Oh, I'd have a cooking show.'","My favorite room in the house is my kitchen. It's definitely the heart and soul of our home. It's where we gather in the morning as a family to start the day, and it's where we wind down at night over supper.","Growing up, I remember I had several different 45 singles. But the first album I received was from a family friend: Emmylou Harris' 'Roses In The Snow.' It was so incredible. This record, to this day, is the favorite album of my life.","I'll tell you this: I will be committed wholeheartedly to Little Big Town as long as the Lord allows this ride to continue. And then I'll cook until way after people want to look at me.","Luckily, I have my husband, who is Mr. Organized. Because I don't have that part of Martha Stewart in my body.","When you sit down around the table, it's a great time to catch up and share and talk about the day, and I think that can keep families connected and together.","I like to take care of people, and I like to make sure that they're OK and happy.","I like to do special things for people. Any time someone has a birthday, I make them a really special cake that they all seem to love - it's a Coca-Cola cake.","I learned something through the experiences in my life, and that is that you never judge how someone may be reacting to a situation because you don't know what they may be going through. It's important that you treat people well, and I try to make people feel good about themselves always.","Sometimes it's hard to eat healthy on the road, especially on the days when we play fairs and festivals! There is lots of fried temptation there, and it's hard for this Southern girl to turn down some good fried food.","My girl crush is Dolly Parton. I've never met her, but I keep wanting to run into her in a grocery story or something!","Oh, gosh, first of all, Paula Deen is my idol. I adore that woman. I got to be on her show a few months ago, and I'm telling you that was at the top of my bucket list.","There is a tradition in Southern cooking of recipes handed down for generations. And when I make my grandmother's strawberry pie - she is gone on now - I feel her right with me."],"Kimberly Williams-Paisley":["Always enjoy the ride, because you don't know where it's going, but it's going to be all right.","I am obsessed with kale. I make kale salads and kale chips, and I think it's so yummy.","I need to go to my yoga class - I love hot yoga!","I don't do very well with extremes of any kind - extreme diets, extreme fitness - so moderation makes a lot of sense, and Hershey's has really great portion-friendly desserts to help people incorporate treats into their lifestyles so they don't feel like they're depriving themselves and are still living a balanced life.","The infant mortality rates are insanely high. The obesity epidemic is on the rise. It is all related.","I love to be able to do something positive with what celebrity I have. I like to be able to make it about something bigger than me; if I can help in some way, I'm happy to do that.","What I love is Mexican hot chocolate, like a spicy hot chocolate - adding cayenne pepper to the Hershey's cocoa and making a spicy-sweet treat."],"Kimberly Willis Holt":["Most of my story ideas come from my childhood. Sometimes they hatch from stories my parents told me, sometimes they come from experiences in my own life, and sometimes they are inspired by mere moments.","If you're having trouble finishing a book, it might be that you're trying to fix it as you go. Just finish the story, no matter how terrible you think that first draft is. Then let it cool off. In other words, don't look at it for a while. Then you can rewrite it.","Although I sometimes enjoy writing from an adult's perspective, I feel dedicated to the coming of age story - that part of a young person's life where he must make a decision that will change his life forever. I still remember what it's like to be twelve years old.","When I was a child, the thing I wanted more than anything was to grow up and live in one house. Since my dad was in the Navy, that wasn't possible. Instead, I lived in a different home every couple of years.","Although I always loved reading and putting words on paper, I never thought about becoming a writer until I was twelve.","My days are filled with writing, reading, and being a mom. Some days, I get to visit schools around the country and talk about what it's like to be a writer. I often feel like I'm pretending, because it's still hard for me to believe it when I see someone holding a book that I've written.","Even though writing articles relies completely on truth, you still must tell an interesting story. You can't worry about people knowing who you are and whether or not they want to read your stories.","My biggest disappointment is that once I'm finished working on the characters, I really do expect to see them in the flesh one day.","My favorite book is 'To Kill A Mockingbird' by Harper Lee. It is multi-layered, and I see something new in it every time I read it.","One of the reasons I write is to be in other people's skin.","Sometimes I'll get a premise, you know, for a book. In fact, I get those quite often. And I don't commit to it until I really know the voice of that character. It's almost as if the character is speaking to me.","I always tend to write about outsiders. And what's been fun for me is, as I travel around and visit schools, is that other kids that feel the same way relate to some of my characters, and so I hope in some way that's helping them when they want to read about somebody that they can relate to.","I wear my pajamas. That's the thing I love most about writing. I don't get changed until I actually have to go out of the house. I'll write and take a late lunch or go to a coffee shop when I get where I can't stand the four walls anymore.","I'm amazed how the tiniest moments grow into books.","When I begin to write a story, I usually know how things will end. It's the journey toward that point I must discover. The process is sometimes painful, but also exciting.","I hope the wonder of what happens to my characters never goes away. That yearning keeps me writing.","I have to re-write a lot. I couldn't tell you how many drafts I write, but I know I've done at least twenty rewrites on each book.","If you haven't taken a writing class, take a writing class. I took every class that was available in my area. I went to conferences inside and outside my area to network with people. That's how I got my agent. I found my agent through another agent who was at a conference.","Write every day. Make writing a part of your life, but also don't be afraid of learning from others because I think you can. I still try to think of myself as a beginner because that way I can keep on learning.","I was born in a hurricane in Pensacola, Florida... my dad was in the military, so we moved all over the place. But I consider myself a southerner from Louisiana. I've lived in Texas for most of my adult life.","When I was young, I was very shy and quiet, because we moved all the time. My dad was in the Navy, so we moved every two years.","I like the fact that I'm from the South and that I have this rich history behind me. I come from a family of storytellers. They can't just tell you how someone went to the store. They have to tell you who they saw, what they were wearing, what they said, what they had in their grocery cart.","Other writers definitely influence my writing. What encourages me and inspires me is when I read a good book. It makes me want to be a better writer."],"Kimbra":["I do like the idea of pulling in different producers to get new perspectives. That's what I did with Vows and I feel it just gives variety and makes for a more exciting journey for the listener.","My process is to be by myself when I record. It's quite an emotional performance to pull off when someone else is in the room. I prefer to go away and have my own time with it, bring it in later.","All my album artwork is body painting.","I'm not very funny!","I think 'SNL' is so well-known for its musical performances, as well, and people really breaking into America through a really great performance on there. So I think me and Gotye are both really excited to be amongst such company. You know, it's great.","I'm turning 22, so I want to start getting into work that reflects where I'm at in life now.","I started writing songs when I was 10. It was a natural way to express myself as a kid. It wasn't until I started listening to jazz, joined the choir and picked up a guitar that my little hobby became something far more serious.","I moved from New Zealand to Melbourne when I was 17. I'd planned to go to university to study French, but I was offered a contract to write and record an album that was too good to pass up. Looking back now I think that was pretty young but, at the time, I was ready to have an adventure.","I have times when I doubt what I'm doing. When those moments hit, I think about how grateful I am to be able to do what I do every day. It was harder when I started because I didn't see the response, but now I'm out there playing for people and seeing them happy, which makes it all worthwhile.","I guess there might come a point when I will want to live an anonymous life. I'm only at the start of my career, so I'm sure that moment will come, but I know how blessed I am to have this platform on which to speak and influence.","When you work on an album for three and a half years, you're kind of ready for it to get out there. To have your songs reach people.","It's a really cool time for artists who want to strive for a little more depth in what they want to say to come forward. We live in a very fast world right now. We've got all this media and music which is so accessible to us, it's here one minute gone the next.","People are consuming more than ever, but I think they want a bit of honesty and depth. Adele, Gotye, Janelle Monae - they're giving you a catchy song, but it's also a challenging song at the same time.","I want to be the kind of artist who keeps pushing on every album. I don't want to settle on a sound.","It feels like it's just starting in America and the UK. It's great to have a loyal fanbase in Australia and New Zealand. People in America say how polished our band are, but that didn't happen overnight; that came from doing all this touring back home.","I feel far more connected to the whole band if I can somehow physically respond... with my body.","Obviously I don't really go to church any more - no time.","I'm so fascinated by the human longing for meaning. The way we relate romantically to each other is so much to do with our longing for meaning as well.","There's a vulnerability in music but you've also got to protect your sacred place and have a place you can still retire to that no one else knows about. So that's a thing I just try to balance.","I haven't stopped writing which is good. I'm scared to stop completely otherwise it might lead to stagnancy.","I'm thinking about a few weeks in Montreal to work with a producer I met there.","People like Jeff Buckley, the Mars Volta and Bjork made me listen to music differently. You learn the voice is an instrument you can do crazy things with.","I like challenging people. I love pop music that can just throw you off.","The fun of being in the pop world is you can really play with people's perceptions of what the word pop means.","You can get really left of centre influences in mainstream pop. Michael Jackson and Prince are some of the most progressive artists ever if you actually dissect their songs there's some crazy stuff going on."],"Kimi Raikkonen":["My time in the World Rally Championship has been a useful stage in my career, but I can't deny the fact that my hunger for F1 has recently become overwhelming.","Since I started in motor racing I've worked with people from all over the world. We are all here to go racing and prejudice will never play any part in that.","I just love the American spirit of racing. It feels just great to get involved with that.","In rallying every curve, every hill may be different than you thought. That makes it interesting.","If I could throw my phone away, I would probably do it. It's always on silent, and I don't like when it rings and people are calling. We could live without those things in the past when we just had a phone on the street somewhere, on the corner or at the house. I have no interest in telling all the people what I do every day and where I am.","Do you have any ambitions outside racing? My main ambition at the moment, whether inside or outside racing, is to become Formula 1 World Champion.","When I was a kid, I would watch the grands prix. Everyone dreamt of becoming a race driver, while I only started thinking about it when I was 18 or 19. Only at that age did I seriously start thinking about this job. Before then, I would change ideas from one second to the next.","In F1 too many things overshadow the racing. There is too much politics.","There's always a lot of talk about motivation to race, but nobody really knows what I do or what I think apart from myself, so I don't really care what people think.","I'm delighted to be coming back to Formula 1 after a two-year break, and I'm grateful to Lotus Renault GP for offering me this opportunity.","It was an easy choice to return with Lotus Renault GP as I have been impressed by the scope of the team's ambition.","When I did some Nascar races this year I noticed that I was increasingly missing the racing side, to race against each other, because in rallying you really race against the clock.","You always want to have a winning car, but there is no guarantee that it will be."],"Kimiko Glenn":["I come from a theater background, so usually, at the start, you know what happens and where the character goes and everything. But with TV, it's really unpredictable.","Thinking back on it, I just really didn't have very many role models to look up to when it came to Asian actresses. And in that way, when I would see an Asian onscreen, it would be a secondary-type thing, and that's kind of how I ended up viewing myself in the world: as secondary.","I'm a carb-y person. I love pastries and whatnot.","When I think back on high school, I always tried to make silly videos with my friends.","I was kind of an obnoxious kid. I would imitate Celine Dion. I would jump around and belt to the rafters and do the accent and everything.","I really loved to sing all the time, and I was constantly entertaining. Finally, my dad saw an article in the local newspaper in Phoenix, and it was for a children's theater, an audition for 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.'","I'm actually more German than Scottish. I'm half-Japanese, 25 percent German, 12 percent Scottish, and 12 percent Irish.","There aren't as many roles, and I think there's a lack of openness in casting an Asian character in a leading role or unless they're a stereotype. It's been hard. I've been able to play some non-stereotypical roles, which is great, but I have a lot of Asian actor friends who are struggling.","I was born and grew up in Phoenix, and I left there when I was 17 to go to Interlochen Arts Academy - a boarding school in Michigan - for a year, and then I went to college for a year at The Boston Conservatory and landed the 'Spring Awakening' tour midway through my freshman year, which was pretty cool.","The theme song of 'Doug' was my ringtone once for literally a year."],"Kimora Lee Simmons":["Even if you can't afford to travel the world, you can take your children to the museum, zoo or local park. And don't be afraid to take them to grown-up spots. Eating out in a restaurant teaches children how to be quiet and polite and gives them the pleasure of knowing you trust them to behave.","Live honestly to a higher note. Life is too short. So, do the best you can and live your life to a higher note.","I think one great tip is that you should always love yourself. If you don't love yourself, take care of yourself, cater to yourself and that little inner voice, you will really not be very worthy of being with someone else, because you won't be the best version of you.","It's not about how skinny you are or how much money or how many diamonds you have - that's the fluff that people sometimes look at as being the main thing. It's about understanding that the things that make you fabulous are all inside of you.","I was bullied and picked on because I was so different to everyone else, and I definitely didn't believe or even know I was fabulous back then. But those hard times made me everything I am today. It's all water under the bridge now, but being bullied and going through adversity definitely made me stronger.","'Fabulosity' is to get up when you've been kicked down, and it's not to go after who kicked you down.","You don't have to dumb down - you just have to find a clever, good, secure man. I've found a couple - I've been lucky - but it's probably hard for everybody to find that true love of a good man.","Women call me all the time and tell me, 'You inspired me to get out of a bad situation,' or 'You inspired me to take the reigns for myself and go and do this.' I try to tell people to live their best life, and do what you know you need to do for yourself and your family. You need to be supported.","I'm a girl's girl. I'm a woman's woman. I'm a cool girl.","Being a working mom, you want to make a difference in our schools, which is making a difference in our children and ultimately it's making a difference in our community.","Like every mom, you try to juggle, but I also want people to know that you don't have to be a superhero. I'm not a superhero; I have a team of people who help me. I have a great family support system.","I can't stand when girls come to me and say they want to be a model, but they can't tell me who the top three photographers are in the world. They can't tell me who the top five biggest models are or name three cosmetics companies. They can't even name the top fashion magazines! You have to get it together and know your stuff.","I try not to be neurotic; I try to create and present healthy body image.","Relationships do change throughout the course of your life, and I always think in terms of relationships changing and evolving rather than starting and stopping.","We've all heard these statistics that teachers at times go into their pockets in the tune of several hundred dollars a year to pay for school supplies and materials. It's not normal.","I look forward to spring cleaning and putting things in their place. It's therapeutic for me.","I don't eat too much. I don't have a lot of time, but I can get in a little treadmill. I eat healthily just because it's good for me, and running after my three kids takes a lot of energy.","I feel like I'm a good motivator; I'm very determined.","I have a really big mouth, I have a lot of opinions and I will be heard.","I'm very determined, honest, open and definitely very energetic. I expect a lot as a boss and I'm very demanding, but I ask that of myself too.","I represent luxury, and that's what I love.","Fabulosity. It's a state of being.","I am not the kind of girl that gets in trouble.","I'm not one of those Hollywood moms where my kid is three weeks old and I'm a size zero. I'm a real woman and I'm a working woman and a working mom.","I have a lot of hang-ups in life with men. I'm not very trusting.","I'm much more into old-world, intimate conversations on the phone. I like to write letters.","I'm fiercely protective of my children even though we are on TV.","I don't apologize for my diamonds, Rolls-Royce, Range Rover, or anything. Look, Queen Elizabeth has more diamonds than me. Why don't people attack her for it?","My family is the most important thing to me.","You can never control other people. You can only control yourself. I have definitely learned that.","Yes, I'm quirky, loud and crazy.","I try to do everything from the viewpoint of what's best for my kids. I have three kids and two great dads and it's not always easy, but you have to try to be a little selfless and we manage just fine.","My girls and I regularly go through their rooms to find clothes and toys to donate to charities. I firmly believe that children who have been given so much need to experience the joy that comes from giving.","All children can do things to help, whether how big or small - by donating toys or lending a hand in the community.","I think my customers, my fans are really like my family now - it's like a movement of fabulosity.","I have help, but I'm very hands-on in everything I do. I do normal stuff, I'm a normal mother and I'm a very hardworking woman and I have hundreds of products and many businesses that I do.","For me it's always God, family, and then my work.","You never want to do anything that you don't want your mother to see, because it will haunt you and eventually come back to bite you!","Study the field that you want to get into and know everything about it.","I wanted my closet to look like a boutique.","I'm very neurotic is what my closet says about me. It's always in great order.","It was tough for me at school... trying to blend in and get along with other kids. I was an oddity and kids are scared of things they don't understand.","I worked with the best - Givenchy, Dior, Yves Saint Laurent - and it gave me an ability to be confident. It turned me into a CEO and a creative director and a brand.","I don't believe that fashion should exclude people - I have always been about making it accessible to everyone.","I'm lucky, always hopeful... I love my life.","Yes, I live a crazy, exciting, whatever life, but I do think it's quite relatable because it has to be - I'm just a girl from St Louis, Missouri that has lived life like anyone else. There are things that are crazy and over the top, but the basic thread is my family, my career, trying to live and pursuing my dreams.","I put my family first, and that's why for a long time, you didn't see me dating or hear about me dating or hear about me out. I had other focuses in my life, and that would be my family and my work.","You don't see me in the clubs unless I'm throwing a party for Fashion Week.","It's not always about the money and the fame, and a lot of people think that it is sometimes.","Very few people know this, but I love organizational products and tools. One of my favorite places to shop are container stores where you can get bins, boxes and crates to organize your life.","A lot of the things I hold onto have memories attached to them. Bags, shoes and jewelry that were given to me from photo shoots and fashion shows throughout my career."],"Kin Hubbard":["We would all like to vote for the best man but he is never a candidate.","A bee is never as busy as it seems; it's just that it can't buzz any slower.","Of all the home remedies, a good wife is best.","Fun is like life insurance; the older you get, the more it costs.","If capital and labor ever do get together it's good night for the rest of us.","There is no failure except in no longer trying. There is no defeat except from within, no really insurmountable barrier save our own inherent weakness of purpose.","Peace has its victories no less than war, but it doesn't have as many monuments to unveil.","Don't knock the weather; nine-tenths of the people couldn't start a conversation if it didn't change once in a while.","Nobody can be as agreeable as an uninvited guest.","The world gets better every day - then worse again in the evening.","Classical music is the kind we keep thinking will turn into a tune.","Where ignorance is bliss it's foolish to borrow your neighbor's newspaper.","There's no secret about success. Did you ever know a successful man who didn't tell you about it?","Boys will be boys, and so will a lot of middle-aged men.","A good listener is usually thinking about something else.","If you haven't seen your wife smile at a traffic cop, you haven't seen her smile her prettiest.","It used to be that a fellow went on the police force when everything else failed, but today he goes in the advertising game.","Next to a circus there ain't nothing that packs up and tears out faster than the Christmas spirit.","Getting talked about is one of the penalties for being pretty, while being above suspicion is about the only compensation for being homely.","When a fellow says, 'It ain't the money but the principle of the thing,' it's the money.","An optimist is a fellow who believes what's going to be will be postponed.","Nobody ever forgets where he buried the hatchet.","Some folks can look so busy doing nothing that they seem indispensable.","All the world loves a good loser.","It's the good loser who finally loses out.","The safe way to double your money is to fold it over once and put it in your pocket.","Being an optimist after you've got everything you want doesn't count.","No one can feel as helpless as the owner of a sick goldfish.","It is pretty hard to tell what does bring happiness; poverty and wealth have both failed.","It's what a fellow thinks he knows that hurts him.","The fellow that agrees with everything you say is either a fool or he is getting ready to skin you.","Honesty pays, but it doesn't seem to pay enough to suit some people.","The hardest thing is to take less when you can get more.","It's pretty hard to tell what does bring happiness; poverty and wealth have both failed.","It isn't enough for you to love money - it's also necessary that money should love you.","If there's anything a public servant hates to do it's something for the public.","Live so that you can at least get the benefit of the doubt.","Now and then an innocent man is sent to the legislature.","Lack of pep is often mistaken for patience.","Nothing is as irritating as the fellow who chats pleasantly while he's overcharging you.","The only way to entertain some folks is to listen to them.","Some fellows get credit for being conservative when they are only stupid.","Bargain... anything a customer thinks a store is losing money on.","The fellow that owns his own home is always just coming out of a hardware store.","It's going to be fun to watch and see how long the meek can keep the earth once they inherit it.","Kindness goes a long ways lots of times when it ought to stay at home.","A loafer always has the correct time.","It ain't a bad plan to keep still occasionally even when you know what you're talking about.","Men are not punished for their sins, but by them.","If some people didn't tell you, you'd never know they'd been away on a vacation.","As to those who hoard gold and silver and spend it not in God's path, give them, then, the tidings of a painful agony: on a day when these things shall be heated in hell-fire, and their foreheads, and their sides, and their backs shall be branded therewith.","No woman can be handsome by the force of features alone, any more that she can be witty by only the help of speech.","Nobody kicks on being interrupted if it's by applause.","Every once in a while someone without a single bad habit gets caught.","Nobody ever grew despondent looking for trouble.","Lots of folks confuse bad management with destiny.","The worst feature of a new baby is its mother's singing.","Nobody works as hard for his money as the man who marries it.","Universal peace sounds ridiculous to the head of an average family.","There are two ways to handle a woman, and nobody knows either of them.","A grouch escapes so many little annoyances that it almost pays to be one.","A lot of Thanksgiving days have been ruined by not carving the turkey in the kitchen.","There is nothing so aggravating as a fresh boy who is too old to ignore and too young to kick.","I don't look for much to come out of government ownership as long as we have Democrats and Republicans.","After a fellow gets famous it doesn't take long for someone to bob up that used to sit by him in school.","I'll say this for adversity: people seem to be able to stand it, and that's more than I can say for prosperity."],"Kina Grannis":["In finding love, I think it's important to be patient. In being in a relationship, I think it's important to be honest, to communicate, to respect and trust, and to strive to give more than you take.","I get to travel around the world and meet all of these amazing people, and they're singing my songs! And to me, that's crazy.","I started teaching myself guitar because I loved singing so much. Then one day kind of out of the blue I found I was writing a song. It just happened organically.","I'm really into good nutrition and keeping healthy! That said, I'm also addicted to candy - It's my biggest weakness.","The potential success that could come with signing with a major label didn't quite outweigh how important it was for me to make my music the way I knew it needed to be made.","My two sisters and I sang all the time. Whenever we cleaned the kitchen, we sang in three-part harmony.","Not only am I putting music out there, I'm giving part of myself away.","I want to encourage people to make healthy life choices, whether it's training for a half-marathon, or eating more vegetables.","I've loved singing since forever. Whether it was with my sisters while cleaning the kitchen, putting shows on for my stuffed animals, writing songs about my stuffed animals, starting an a capella group with my cousins while on vacation, or awkwardly singing along to karaoke tracks alone in my bedroom - singing always found a way into my life.","In college, I faced an interesting problem. I wanted to play music all the time and yet I wasn't ready for anyone to hear it. To remedy this, I took to retreating to stairwells as a safe place to sing and write music. It was there that I wrote most of my songs in college and really grew into an artist.","If you're looking to make a basic living selling and playing your music, the Internet is all you really need.","Making a video is one of the most exciting things for artists and fans. It's like a payoff.","If I try to write a song, I will completely fail to write a song. But if I'm just holding my guitar and I just start humming, then I'll have a song in an hour.","The first video I ever made, announcing 'Crash the Super Bowl,' I did about fifty takes and I wanted to die. It was awful.","I think a lot of singer-songwriters get compared to each other, but I'd like to think that what I'm doing is special and specific to me.","My dream artists to collaborate with are probably Cee Lo Green and Imogen Heap. They're completely out of my genre but they're both musical geniuses.","I don't have any rock star demeanor to me. I just can't pull that off.","Ever since I was really really little, I was just singing all the time. Like one of my favorite games when I was little would be to just have one of my sisters pick a title, and I would impromptu create that song.","My first performance was in AP Calculus when they forced me up into the front of the classroom and made me sing a song, which was really scary, but it was fun.","I went into college undeclared. I had no idea what I wanted to do, but I knew that music was obviously this central big important thing in my life that I was gonna keep doing.","I'm kind of feeling like I don't mind being open with the random details of my life, like I'm at a coffee shop or my toe hurts or something, but obviously other more personal areas of life where I will just never really go there."],"King Bach":["I knew since third grade I wanted to be Jim Carrey. His freedom, his goofiness, his crazy, loud, sudden energy. I told my family I was going to be a pediatrician, but in the back of my mind, I was like, 'Nope, I'm going to be the biggest movie star ever.'","I'm theatrically trained. Before Vine, before any of the social media, I was an actor. I was going to auditions; I was taking the classes.","When I start doing movies, that'll be the time to pack Vine in. Quit when you're on top. Be the king.","I just use all the skills that I learned in film school, and I just incorporate them into my sketches. People don't realize that, with a story, there has to be a beginning, middle and end. There has to be a problem and a resolution. Just because it's six seconds doesn't mean it's not a story.","A lot of Viners do more relatable stuff, but I try to stay away from that. I try to maybe take a relatable situation and Bach it up."],"King George II":["Mad, is he? Then I hope he will bite some of my other generals.","We are come for your good, for all your goods."],"King George VI":["The highest of distinctions is service to others."],"King George V":["Always go to the bathroom when you have a chance.","I have many times asked myself whether there can be more potent advocates of peace upon earth through the years to come than this massed multitude of silent witnesses to the desolation of war.","My father was frightened of his mother; I was frightened of my father, and I am damned well going to see to it that my children are frightened of me.","Today 23 years ago dear Grandmama died. I wonder what she would have thought of a Labour Government.","Is it possible that my people live in such awful conditions? I tell you, Mr Wheatley, that if I had to live in conditions like that I would be a revolutionary myself.","I venture to allude to the impression which seemed generally to prevail among their brethren across the seas, that the Old Country must wake up if she intends to maintain her old position of pre-eminence in her colonial trade against foreign competitors.","After I am dead, the boy will ruin himself in twelve months.","How is the Empire?"],"King Hu":["I don't like James Bond. They made him a super hero, but he is just an agent, a human being. In my movies, secret agents are more realistic, I didn't want to portray them in the most glowing colours.","The audience is the camera.

I've grown up with a lot of open eyes around me that's influenced my eyes to open.","All of my stuff is raw, it's emotive, it's real.","When I realized I could write lyrics and let someone that I knew listen to them, but not know that the song was about them - say it was a girl. I could write this song about how I feel about this girl, I could play it to them. I just loved it, because all of the words would speak to them. I could see them slowly falling in love with me.","I want to get more and more sophisticated. I'm ready to go from being a kid to being a king.","I've got rid of a lot of cynicism and anger. I feel positive about my development, and I just want to carry on making music and building myself as a person.","I'm trying to create a collection of stories - the 'U.F.O.W.A.V.E.' songs are all stories. I haven't really taken direct lyrical influence from other songwriters, but my dad bought me a book of W.H. Auden's poems when I was younger, and the imagery really interested me.","A lot of the time, I was unhappy as a kid, so I spent it, I guess, in a gray place.","I do love the music aspect of the Internet. The Internet made me.","I actually find a lot of pleasure in writing lyrics.","My dad is an art director for BBC TV shows, and my mum does screen printing workshops. Both of my parents played instruments, too, and my mum used to have crazy house parties when me and my brother were young - dub and garage would be banging through my house.","My mum used to work in New York in Spike Lee's shop; she did the outfits for the video for P.M. Dawn's 'Set Adrift on Memory Bliss.'","I never got lessons. I took influence from Chet Baker, Ian Dury, and Joe Strummer. I don't hear my voice and think, 'Yeah, that's a banging voice!' It's more about putting the right emotions into the right words and the lyrics than anything else to me.","When I make music, it's a very visual thing. Conjures up a lot of images.","A lot of people who have been perceiving my music have been trying to formulate a genre for it, and I think it's just a natural thing; it doesn't need to be categorized. It doesn't need to be sectioned, if you will.","I've mainly been sampling jazz because the tone of the chords are expressive in itself, so it's quite nice to write over. It's got interpretations of a lot of different genres, too, a lot of dubby-ness and experimental stuff.","When I was younger, I used to do that a lot: I would hear a part of a song that would really relax me and then put it on repeat. That would send me to sleep. It was quite obvious classical music, people like Penguin Cafe Orchestra, Erik Satie, Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel.","I was always wrapped around music being a tradition, a skill.","My uncle was in a ska band called the Top Cats; that was my first proper influence, as I was taken to see them every week. It sort of built up, the want to replicate it creatively.","I got a lot from my uncle who is a really good ska guitarist. Very ragged makeshift rhythms and intricate lines.","There's a lot of tension in London, but then you realize it's always been there, in its history, and that the best thing about London, that there's always been this tension.","Stuff like Buena Vista Social Club and Fela Kuti were quite a main thing to my childhood. As soon as I reached an age where I realized that Fela was singing in English, when I got past his accent, I loved the rawness of it, and the funk and the rhythm and the melody.","Especially with the live, just the way I curve words, it's about expression. It's so emotive, to be able to release these words into a mike. It really emphasizes this insane tingle down my spine whenever I play.","I changed from 'Zoo Kid' to 'King Krule' mainly because I didn't want to be called a 'Kid' when I was 20, so I just thought I'd get rid of that alias and change it now while I'm younger. I wanted to change it quick. and 'King Krule' was the first thing that came into my head.","Because the Internet's there, I have access to a lot of the legends, like Fela Kuti. I used to watch a lot of Fela Kuti videos, just to see how he performed. He inspired me a lot, actually, because he was a man of many words, many good words.","I guess from 12 onwards I was always into my music.","I went through quite a few establishments that maybe weren't great for myself - security units, youth-offender places. I guess that was going to the lions' den. Social services said, 'You've got to go to some sort of school.'","I got alright GCSEs, but I was lost. I didn't know what to do, whether to continue with education, go to uni, go to art school - then again, I was like, 'Maybe I should just go and get a job, start early and make money.'","Jazz is more raw than punk in a lot of ways. It's so expressive. A lot of people say to me, especially older people, 'It took me ages to get into jazz.'","It's strange. No one ever really talked to me about my voice. People started writing about it, and I was like, 'What?' I'm really about my lyrics, but more people were talking about my voice. It's cool, but at first I got upset because I wanted people to focus on the content."],"King Solomon":["A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.","As iron sharpens iron, so a friend sharpens a friend.","All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full.","Kindness and faithfulness keep a king safe, through kindness his throne is made secure.","Your own soul is nourished when you are kind; it is destroyed when you are cruel.","A fool is wise in his eyes.","A good name is rather to be chosen than riches.","Do not rebuke mockers, or they will hate you; rebuke the wise, and they will love you.","Train up a child in the way that he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.","Who is the wise man?

Show the extremes of your personality and embrace the imperfections. Embrace the things about yourself that you might not like.","I think the first person who kind of broke my mind was probably Jimi Hendrix. Listening to him opened my mind up to where you can take music and how far you can take rock n' roll.","You've gotta dive into the abyss if you wanna get anything good. Every record, you've gotta go down in the abyss and hope that you come out of it alive.","I love dogs. I think dogs are way smarter. Maybe I can be the dog spokesman for the rock world. There are a lot of cat people making rock music.","My dad took me and my brother to see Corrosion of Conformity. All I remember was that there was a dude swinging a chain in the mosh pit, and the bouncers were dragging him out.","I used to play video games all the time, but now I don't because I don't have an attention span.","I love Hanukkah because it's so weird. You just sit there and light candles and say spells.","Bob Saget is the bear from the Golden Crisp box.","That's always my downfall on tour: the food. I just want to eat everything.","I'm in East L.A., like Mount Washington, Highland Park. There's a little strip that they're gentrifying, trying to make a hip spot, but you go there, and it's just kind of barren. Nobody hangs out anywhere in L.A. There's no loitering in L.A., so I don't know what to do with myself.","I have a 15-passenger van, which is not fun to drive in L.A. ever.","I'm not a huge practicer, which is probably not a good thing because my band definitely needs to practice.","Every record has been very different, so I can't really compare them. The first record was good. I originally recorded about half the songs on that one in 2003 or something, and then I went back a few years later and re-recorded them and added some other songs.","I find it harder to write the lyrics afterwards because then you're just trying to fit them into something that's already there.","You do anything long enough, and somebody will end up paying attention to it.","I had just made this album called 'Mind Blow,' a CD-R release on Spirit of Orr. This was in 2003. Quite a few of the songs from 'Was Dead' were actually on that.","I knew there was something about 'Sun Medallion,' in particular, because I just had to record it the second I wrote it.","I loved living with my parents - that's probably why I did it for so long. But it was almost too easy to live there. I had to force myself to get out, had to challenge myself. I had to start a new chapter.","I like recording by myself wherever I can, just because then I feel like I have ultimate freedom, and I can just control whatever I want to put down. There's something about going into your own little world.","Over time, certain people don't want to go on tour, and that can easily break up a band.","I love collaborating with people, but I also really love working by myself.","Vermont will always be my home in my heart, but I really love L.A.","Both labels are super awesome, with super awesome people who want to get stuff done. The biggest difference is that Sub Pop is already established, but working with Burger seems like we're part of something. They're growing, and I'm growing with them. They're my friends, and we're doing it together.","I don't like science because I don't think it makes sense to put a definition on everything. It's a lot more exciting to think of things as mysterious.","My best moments are when I write songs out of nowhere.","I never took any guitar lessons or anything; I never really learned to play covers. I'm actually happy that I never took lessons as a kid. Now, I'd like to take lessons to kind of go deeper. But I think sometimes lessons can steal a person's personality away, because they're trying to do things so technically.","I love the sound of '70s glam records. I love that snare sound. The recordings I like, it's all based on if the snare sounds good. The drums have to sound great.","I've got the best parents you could ever ask for. My parents are from New Jersey, and they met in Vermont in college. My Dad grew up listening to heavy, psychedelic music. He's my biggest fan.","I played with the Lust-Cats once in Denver. I've seen Happy Jawbone a bunch of times, but I can't remember if I played those shows or not.","Brattleboro is a very small town, but it's pretty liberal.","My friends always had bands, and we would play together.","It's hard to talk about it without sounding like a hippie. But trees are really inspiring to me. They're like the masters of the earth.","Rock and roll music - people want records. For me, it's the whole thing - the package. I don't get satisfaction from buying an MP3.","I listen to top 40, old country, blues... I'm really into Roger Miller.","I saw Frances Bean at a Blink 182 show. And she was with a guy who looked just like Kurt Cobain.","I always tell people there's some kind of wall that you have to break through to see the beauty of L.A. The first few times I came here, I was like, 'I don't know about this place.' Then one day, it just totally flipped for me. It was crazy.","It involved a lot of trust, but I love Bobby Harlow, and I loved the albums that he made.","The very first music I recorded by myself, when I was 17, I said it was by King Tuff.","I ended up doing these other diverse things, but King Tuff is the thing I always wanted to come back to - just good, straightforward rock n' roll. That music is the most me, you know?","My friends ask me what it's like moving from Vermont to L.A., but no matter where I am, I pretty much just end up sitting in coffee shops, thinking about songs."],"King Vidor":["In my opinion, the motion picture is the greatest medium of expression ever invented. It embraces all the other arts. The films that have the greatest unity, the greatest overall strength, and give the most satisfaction to the viewer, have been those in which a guiding hand was imposed in every section of the film's many divisions.","There is the story in every man's heart of human progress. I believe every one of us knows that his major job on Earth is to make some contributions, no matter how small, to this inexorable movement of human progress.","In Hollywood, the cameraman lights the star.

We are not anti-anything: The Guild being formed for the purpose of assisting and improving the director's work in the form of a collective body, rather than as an individual, as was necessary in the past.","The director is the channel through which a motion picture reaches the screen.","A simple story filmed with limited sets can often be more effective than a costly extravaganza. provided it had depth and allows the audience to identify with the character."],"Kingman Brewster, Jr.":["There is no greater challenge than to have someone relying upon you; no greater satisfaction than to vindicate his expectation.","Universities should be safe havens where ruthless examination of realities will not be distorted by the aim to please or inhibited by the risk of displeasure.","If I take refuge in ambiguity, I assure you that it's quite conscious.","We all live in a televised goldfish bowl.","Incomprehensible jargon is the hallmark of a profession.","The function of a briefing paper is to prevent the ambassador from saying something dreadfully indiscreet.

What I mean by hard is that... I've been kind of reckless with things. I'm a passionate person. I'm a super passionate person. I think there's definitely been sorrow in my life, good and bad. I think it comes through. I hope it comes through in my writing because to me that's what artistry is.","To hear people saying, 'The music you are doing has really touched my life and it's moved me in a lot of ways. It's helped me get through some tough times.' That's the best compliment that you could get.","I started playing guitar, like, when I was 17 or so, but where I'm from, you just don't hear about people moving to Nashville and making it.

Its warped space whirls around the central singularity like air in a tornado.","If you have somebody who's brilliant and highly creative with a different point of view than you have, and a very different intellectual background, great things can happen.","When you fall into a black hole, everything that falls in after you over millions of years, as seen by you inside the black hole, comes pounding down on you in a fraction of a second, because of the enormous differences of time flow.","I can't imagine not being in a phase where I'm trying to understand something or create something.

When you grow up in the Rocky Mountains, like I did, you see the snow drifts piled up six feet high, and you're two feet, so it's impressive.","Gravitational waves will bring us exquisitely accurate maps of black holes - maps of their space-time. Those maps will make it crystal clear whether or not what we're dealing with are black holes as described by general relativity.","As a true scientist, I have been proved wrong so many times that I'm very humble.","When I ask myself what are the great things we got from the Renaissance, it's the great art, the great music, the science insights of Leonardo da Vinci. Two hundred years from now, when you ask what are the great things that came from this era, I think it's going to be an understanding of the universe around us.","If you have a wormhole, then you can turn them into time machines for going backward in time.","I do hope that 'Interstellar' and this kind of science in film will catch the public fancy and help to reignite an interest in science - and a respect for the power of science in dealing with the problems that society has to deal with.","I wanted to be a snowplow driver when I was a kid. Growing up in the Rocky Mountains, that's the most glorious job you can imagine. But then my mother took me to a lecture about the solar system when I was 8, and I got hooked.","Each black hole spins on its axis like the Earth spins. That spin creates two vortexes of twisting space, somewhat like vortexes in a bathtub or a whirlpool.","We're going to need a definitive quantum theory of gravity, which is part of a grand unified theory - it's the main missing piece.","We have to have a combination of general relativity that describes the warping of space and time, and quantum physics, which describes the uncertainties in that warping and how they change.","Whether you can go back in time is held in the grip of the law of quantum gravity.","Sending people into space is very important culturally. That's really the justification. You cannot rationally justify it on the basis of the science and technology we get out of it.","A big misconception is that a black hole is made of matter that has just been compacted to a very small size. That's not true. A black hole is made from warped space and time.","When gravitational waves reach the earth, the waves stretch and squeeze space. This is a tiny stretch and squeeze. Far too small to detect with ordinary human senses.","I became interested in this question of whether you can build wormholes for interstellar travel. I realized that if you had a wormhole, the theory of general relativity by itself would permit you to go backward in time.","We see no objects in our universe that could become wormholes as they age.","Our universe - it's three-dimensional, but we can pretend it's two-dimensional so it's like this sheet of paper - and we live in Pasadena over here and London is over there, and it's thousands of miles from Pasadena to London.","It was quite a surprise when I realized that with a single wormhole you could have time hook up towards the future or towards the past and that you can actually manipulate the wormhole and change how time hooked up.","I have used movies to go to sleep at night. You flip from channel to channel to channel and see just enough to make your brain mushy and go to sleep.","I can enjoy 'Harry Potter' and 'Star Trek,' but I really appreciate hard science fiction.","I got a lot of notoriety early on. Much of my career I was just trying to prove I was as good as the world thought I was.","I think that the future of the human race is to spread through the universe, and now is the time that we should be laying the foundations for that.","The essential point is that, although coordinates are a powerful, and sometimes essential, tool in many calculations, the fundamental laws of physics can be expressed without the aid of coordinates; and, indeed, their coordinate-free expressions are generally elegant and exceedingly powerful.","In subjects that physicists think of as purely quantum, classical ideas and classical computational techniques can often be powerful.","If you think that the distance from the Earth to the nearest planet where we could live comfortably... is being, like, from New York to Australia... what we've achieved so far, in going to the moon, that's about two-and-a-half inches. So that's the challenge.","We're born with a curiosity about the universe. Those people who don't have a curiosity don't have it because it's gotten beaten out of them in some way.","We'll have four different gravitational wave windows open within the next 20 years, and each of them will see something different. We'll be probing the birth of the universe with this. The so-called 'inflationary era' of the universe. We'll be probing the birth of the fundamental forces and how they came into being.","I'm a real klutz computationally, so Mathematica is just ideal for me.","Black holes do not emit light, so you visualize them through gravitational lensing - how they bend light from other objects.","My passion is to understand the non-linear dynamics of warped space-time, and the ideal venue for this is black-hole collisions.","The jury is not in, so we just don't know. But there are very strong indications that wormholes that a human could travel through are forbidden by the laws of physics. That's sad, that's unfortunate, but that's the direction in which things are pointing.","Wormholes - if you don't have something threading through them to hold them open, the walls will basically collapse so fast that nothing can go through them."],"Kip Winger":["A producer should only be there to enable an artist to be himself.","The songs were really complicated. I used to meet people in bar bands who were trying to play our songs and they were really struggling with it. Technically it was really difficult stuff.","As a musician, basically the masses never thought I was a musician.","We were lumped into the Lite Metal radio bands.","Good records - from my point of view, where I grew up which was Led Zeppelin and Jethro Tull... bands that were pushing the envelope a little - musically and in production.","It's like, on my solo stuff, every single person who buys the record, gets it. On the other stuff, the masses... when you have a hit on the radio, not everyone's going to get it. They are going to buy it for the hit.","I play piano and guitar. Acoustic guitar. I tried studying classical guitar when I was 16 but it got really hard. I could never play a lead to save my life.","I could play everything but could never take a lead. My brain just doesn't work like that.","I think it's important to know your limitations too.","I've studied voice from a few different people for years.","We tune down a full step when we play but I never miss a note. I've learned how to keep my voice.","The main thing is that I've been studying composition for the last four years. I'd say it's the life experience combined with the lessons that enabled me to go much further.","I'm a child of the 70's; influenced mostly by albums that had a wide variety of style.","Throughout the years I have tried to hone my skills to gain mastery over the music in my head.","In general, I don't feel artists should need producers.","Rock stardom and all that stuff like that was never like my main M.O., my main M.O. is musical growth, and if I become a rock star in the process, great!","I'm not financially insecure anymore either so I don't have to sit there and get on the latest Poison tour just to make money, which is what a lot of them are doing.","I wouldn't do just a tour, it would have to be an album, and the album would have to beat Pull.","To actually put the time and energy into an album that would be better than Pull would be a hell of a lot of work, because I took that band really seriously, way more seriously than people took us. If you go back and listen to the records, you can hear it.","God would have to beam into me what I was doing and what the album actually sounded like because usually when I start a project like that, I already know what the album sounds like before I start it.","I was just going more for what I've always been influenced by, European music.","I was really into Black Sabbath, but heavy guitars can really be very limiting, it's a great frequency and it's great fun to listen to but on the other hand, musically you can do a lot more without it.","It's a little bit more like I want to give this to the people that are really into it first - I don't have a lot of desire to be like Bon Jovi or something like that, I really want to concentrate on the music.","I'd like to tour, but again, to tour my music now would take a bigger band."],"Kiran Ahluwalia":["I want a car that will last 10 years or longer because I totally hate the process of researching, shopping for a new car, and then haggling for the price. I wish I could just snap my fingers and my car is there.","Sometimes I envy people who can be only half crazy, with one foot in the passion and one foot in the real world. But that's not me. I dive into the total crazy experience. That's the only way to travel.","I think all groups who don't fit in clearly with Western music have to think, 'How can I expand my market? Where else can I perform?'","My CD collection has a lot of world music - lots of Indian, African, Portuguese, Greek, Italian music. Because of my husband, a lot of jazz, too.","The arts are a major life nourishment.","When a song came on the radio that I wanted to learn, my mother would quickly write down the lyrics for me. Soon after, I would be singing it."],"Kiran Bedi":["The focus is what is right before you - to give it your best. It sows the seeds of tomorrow.","I believe in prayer. I believe in gratitude and serving people.","My policing was nothing but activism - it had to be.","I had a clear vision: if I take up an assignment, I'll do full justice to it; otherwise I'll walk away."],"Kiran Desai":["The Indian diaspora is a wonderful place to write from, and I am lucky to be part of it.","I do think that the modern India does belong to writers who are living in India.","I love Truman Capote, Tennessee Williams, Flannery O'Connor. I read a lot of American writers.","I'm always in the kitchen, cooking and experimenting - I love it. And every now and then I think, 'I should write a cookbook' or, 'I should write for food magazines.' And then I get drawn back to writing fiction again.","I don't think you can write according to a set of rules and laws; every writer is so different.","I feel as comfortable anywhere as I feel uncomfortable anywhere.","When you write on your own, you can write the extremes. No one else is watching and you can really go as far as you need to.","The publishing world is very timid. Readers are much braver.","When I was growing up the publishing world seemed so far away. When my mother wrote a book, she would look up the address of publishers on the backs of the books she owned and send off her manuscript.","In India, if you are from the elite, dogs are extremely important. The breed of the dog indicates your wealth, that you are westernized. The cook, another human being, is on a much lower level than your dog. You see this all the time.","If you write a lovely story about India, you're criticized for selling an exotic version of India. And if you write critically about India, you're seen as portraying it in a negative light - it also seems to be a popular way to present India, sort of mangoes and beggars.","We think of immigration as a Western issue but, of course, it isn't.","New York is a lovely city. It is an easy city to go back to and an easy city to leave. Every time I go there I immediately make travel plans."],"Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw":["I do serve on various boards and I'm very honest and frank, obviously. I am a very forthright person and I do, sort of, share my candid views on anything.","As you become more successful, the gender barrier disappears. The credibility challenges you have during your growing up years starts disappearing when you start demonstrating success.","I want to be remembered as someone who put India on the scientific map of the world in terms of large innovation. I want to be remembered for making a difference to global healthcare. And I want to be remembered as someone who did make a difference to social economic development in India.","When I started Biocon in 1978, the obstacles I needed to navigate were manifold - ranging from infrastructural hurdles to issues related to my credibility as a business woman. With no access to venture capital, money was scarce and high-cost, debt-based capital was all I had.","My passion for innovation and my interest in the 'business of science' has seen Biocon commercialize many innovative platforms and products.","If you think about brewing, it is biotechnology. And I would say that I was a technologist at heart. So whether I... fermented beer or whether I fermented enzymes, the base technology was the same.","I've had many failures in terms of technological... business... and even research failures. I really believe that entrepreneurship is about being able to face failure, manage failure and succeed after failing.","As a traditionally risk-averse nation, India has rarely been at the forefront of innovation. Indian companies have mostly imitated others and became very good at it.","You have to build a culture of philanthropy. In a country like India, we need to be sensitive and caring about the poorer, more disadvantaged section of our country.","My legacy is going to be in affordable health care. I am willing to invest in developing that model and the policies around it.","My father was a brew master. He was the one who I was very close to, he influenced me in many many ways including my pursuing a career as a brew master.","I guess I was very fortunate; I had a very very, lets put it this way, I had very wonderful upbringing and a childhood where my parents, of course, exposed us to many cultural aspects, not only of India but other parts of the world.","I have a great team who has helped me build Biocon, I was very fortunate to be able to share my vision with a group of people who really were as excited about challenges as I was.","I think, in terms of corporate philosophy, I've always believed that you've got to treat people in a very very egalitarian manner in the sense I like to treat people on a one-to-one basis. And I like people to take on a lot of responsibilities because I think with a sense of responsibility also comes a sense of purpose.","The brewing industry is a very, very male dominated industry. It's a male bastion.","I am very concerned about the fact that India as a country does not have a national health system, and I am determined to try and influence the government to really build a national health system for the country.","Indian business women like Indra Nooyi, Chanda Kochhar, Naina Lal Kidwai, Shikha Sharma, Swati Piramal, Anu Agha, Swati Piramal, Sulajja Firodia Motwani and Zia Mody have put India on the global firmament.","What really got me focused on cancer was when my best friend was diagnosed with breast cancer, and even though she was a well-to-do person, I found that her treatment costs were crippling.","I faced a number of challenges whilst I built Biocon. Initially, I had credibility challenges where I couldn't get banks to fund me; I couldn't recruit people to work for a woman boss. Even in the businesses where I had to procure raw materials, they didn't want to deal with women.","Unfortunately, our stock is somehow not well understood by the markets. The market compares us with generic companies. We need to look at Biocon as a bellwether stock. A stock that is differentiated, a stock that is focused on R&D, and a very, very strong balance sheet with huge value drivers at the end of it.","It was a chance encounter with a biotech entrepreneur from Ireland that got me started as an entrepreneur in India, because I partnered this Irish company in setting up India's first biotech company.","One of my objectives when I started Biocon was to make sure that I create a company for women scientists to pursue a vocation.","I hate the title of being called 'the richest woman in India,' but it's the recognition that this was the value that I had created as a woman entrepreneur, and that makes me very, very proud."],"Kirby Bliss Blanton":["I just wanna be a DJ!","I have friends, I'm from Texas originally, and they follow me and they keep up with what I'm doing.","I just feel so fortunate, A, that I'm able to talk to people and B, keep in contact with my real friends.","I like comedy a lot. I love comedy. It's so much fun, but it's hard, too.","I hear that I'm funny, and I think I'm funny, but I go in all the time for multicam, and they say that I'm not big enough, or I'm too big. I'm so confused. Okay, well, I'm funny in real life.","I like 'The Big Lebowski'. The Dude is my man. My brother and I can quote that.","I don't read much fiction because I already read a lot of scripts, so I want to learn about the world."],"Kirby Larson":["When someone is working hard on something, that always connects with people, no matter what the differences in generations are.","In a novel, you have space to develop a character or a scene. You don't have that luxury in a 700-800-word picture book.","I was overwhelmed by how military families felt supported and honored by 'Nubs.'","I wanted to use my writing skills to bring attention to the overwhelming needs of the Gulf coast region.","It's so much fun trying to channel my inner four-year-old.","I absolutely love writing and sharing my enthusiasm with students, and because of 'Hattie Big Sky,' Montana holds a special place in my heart.","After writing two books featuring amazing dogs, I decided to be owned by one.","I sold 'Hattie Big Sky' without an agent but quickly realized a writing career required an agent.","After writing several chapter books, I found my true passion: historical fiction."],"Kirby Puckett":["I was told I would never make it because I'm too short. Well, I'm still too short. It doesn't matter what your height is, it's what's in your heart.","Everything has been written. Everybody knows everything about me. There are no secrets. Except the skeletons in my closet.","Tomorrow is not promised to any of us."],"Kirby Smart":["I've seen Coach Saban over the years have to make a lot of tough decisions, and there's not one decision he doesn't make that he doesn't bounce ideas off the staff. To me, that's invaluable.","It never stops. It's 365 recruiting. That cell phone you've got, these smartphones are the death of college coaching.","It's very important that we don't make the same mistakes twice. That's a big part of improvement.","You've got to be diversified enough. That's the truth in the SEC and in college football.","My goal is to outwork everybody in recruiting, sign the best players in the state, and turn these guys into the best team we can.","Welcome to the world we live in as coaches. You've got to figure out what you can do best and better to get these kids a chance to be successful. I think that comes through a lot of things - confidence, improvement, recruiting.","I don't think I've worked a day in my life.","I've got recruits that will text and call and do everything in the middle of the night. And I'm thinking, 'I'm with my family.' But you've got to dedicate time to that, or you can't do it.","When your mom and dad read the paper, they like to know their sons are on the roster.","A team is a group of young men playing together. The program is the entirety of that.","Change is uncomfortable.","Every young man that we want to bring here to the University of Georgia, we want them to graduate from this place.","At the end of the day, you have to go out on the grass and perform.","Every day I pull into that parking spot that says 'Head Football Coach,' I get out of my car and pinch myself sometimes, just to make sure it's real, sort of like, 'Is this really happening?'","How do you play well? You practice well. You prepare well.","I think, as a coach, you have to be willing to do what's best for the player. And you say what's best for the player: is it better to give him a game suspension, three-game suspension, no suspension. I think each case may be different in that.","I think it's what's best for that kid. Are you going to teach that kid a lesson for 10 years down the road by suspending him a game?","I don't recruit against Nick Saban. I recruit for the University of Georgia.","A lot of people think our standard is to be first in the SEC, be first in the country, first in our red zone, and run defense. We really don't go by that motto. We go by, 'Be the best Alabama defense there's been.'","My family's so happy in Tuscaloosa. My wife loves it.","I moved seven times the first seven years I coached.","I could finish my career being a defensive coordinator and say, 'Hey, he's Mickey Andrews.'","When you step out there on the field as a corner in our system, you have to be ready to play because humility is one week away.","Every college coach I talk to won't say it on record, but everyone's thinking, 'Should I go to the league?' Because you don't have the same requirements. It's different. The hours are different.","At the end of the day, if you're not beating the teams on the road recruiting that you have to beat on the field, then you're probably not going to win many championships.","We've got to recruit at the same level of the people who are winning titles and playing for titles, and to do that, we've got to have great facilities.","Let's be honest. Georgia, if you get the best players in this state, you should be winning championships.","It's always a danger when you've got a great quarterback that throws the ball well, that scrambles well. You may push him into his asset. You may force him to do what he does best. So you've got to be able to throw curveballs and stop the pass as much as stop the run.","There's a lot of people who think in order to be a good head coach, you've got to be a head coach at a smaller school.","The amount of pressure that I've put on myself as a defensive coordinator for the last 10, 11 years, I really believe there's a lot more decisions that go into that position than the head coach.","It's very rare that Georgia and Alabama are the only two teams recruiting a kid.","It's never me against Saban, and I have too much respect for him to say that anyway. I never felt that way.","I felt like I was selling a product of the University of Georgia that's really special and really special to me as far as the education you can get, the development you can get, and the league we play in. That's what I've sold.","Coach Richt is a good friend of mine. I respect Coach Richt and worked for him for a year and respect the man he is and respect what he stands for.","Every kid I've been around as a football player, they want their coaches to make them better as men and as players.","What I'm worried about is our team and our players developing and getting better. That's the most important thing.","When you talk about the SEC, you never get a chance to rest.","What you have success with, you feel comfortable with, you always rely on that a little bit.","It's a lot more important to get quality young men and good student-athletes that can be successful at the University of Georgia. That's my No. 1 goal.","I'm a big believer in your offensive limitations come from your quarterback.","It's hard to say that it gets any better to be at your alma mater and run a major college football program.","I always felt like, one of the niches is if you can recruit the SEC, you can be a head coach in the SEC.","I might not have a conference championship or a national championship as a head coach, but I had the recruiting factor.","I think in order to push kids and coach kids the way we want to coach them, we've got to have their trust.","If you chart SEC champions over a 20-year period, the one consistent thing to me is you're not going to win if you don't have a quarterback. It's too critical of a position. He decides something every play.","The ultimate deal is: Are you winning and are you successful? The guys who've done that have had opportunities.","The only thing that matters with my kids are them graduating and playing well, and I try to do my dangedest to get them to play well.","I don't believe in the coach-in-waiting thing. I don't think that works.","I've been very fortunate to be with Coach Saban this long, learned a lot of football from him. It's been kind of the key to my personal success out of the places that I've coached.","To me, personally, my development to become a head coach will be much better working for Coach Saban than necessarily going somewhere else because you learn every day that you're in there.","There's nothing worse than recruiting a player and then leaving the player.","To be honest, it makes you a lot better coach when your boss is in the meeting room. You're a lot more driven every day.","Coach Saban's a great coach; he does it his way, and I have to do it my way. I have to cut my own cloth.","I think the growth you get from working at a place like Alabama and with a program under Nick Saban, it helps me immensely.","A lot of people have said, 'Why not take a smaller school head job?' I honestly feel my growth was better being in a large program, being around Coach Saban, and learning how to manage a lot of the tough situations you deal with in the media.","I think you never leave what you learn.","Our personalities are the not the same, Coach Saban and I. And I have the utmost respect for what he's done and what he's done for me and my family."],"Kiri Te Kanawa":["I really believe I've been a good person. Not perfect - forget about perfect - but just learning by what I was taught and living by my own values. I might have stepped on a few ants - and a few other things as well - but I've never hurt anybody.","Opera is for a lifetime, not just a minute.","I'm completely in charge of my own life now. Sometimes there's no one there to slap me on the hand and say: 'Stop being so bullish and bossy,' and things like that.","I used to suffer from a lot of regret while touring. Regret at having to leave certain places, people and situations, or just a beautiful day.","I knew that I could be more creative onstage, to state my own case and deliver my own interpretation of the role much more aggressively than in the recording studio.","I only have so much energy, so something had to go. This is why, at the end of the day, I've preserved my sanity for the children and also manage to do my best at work.","I'm more confident now than I've ever been. As you get older, you have to be.","We sing these songs for the everyday occasions of life, and they are very close to the hearts of our people.","I felt that the studio recording process makes you stand still too long.","When I perform Strauss, it is as if the music fits me like a glove. My voice seems to lie in a happy area in this music, which is lyrical and passionate at the same time.","When I'm alone at home, I really prefer to listen to Wagner's orchestral music rather than any vocal music. I find it illuminating not to have to pay attention to voices in the recordings.","My children are my children. There's no doubt about that at all. They're very strong towards me, very protective, and I towards them. It works both ways.","The word 'no' is a very good word in a singer's repertoire.","I grew up in the New Zealand countryside. We didn't have television until I was 14, so sing-alongs were our only entertainment.","I never had the influence of any other singer in my music, so I sounded like myself all the time.","My energy is undiminished. Someone said to me the other day, 'Are you retired?' and I said, 'Well, I'm just trying to prove that I'm not.' There's so many things to do.","I tell students, 'If you are learning from YouTube I almost don't want to teach you because what you learn from YouTube it takes 10 times as long to unlearn.' They do an approximation of the centre of the note, an approximation of the interpretation, a cloned version."],"Kirk Acevedo":["Because I'm seen on 'Oz', a lot of the urban cats in the city are like, 'Yo, I thought you'd be rolling in a Mercedes?' And I'm just like, 'Not at all!' This is cable money. There is a big difference between that and a network. But still I can't complain. It's better than doing a 9 to 5 any day.","I tell people all of the time that they would make any show in this business - whether it's black, white, Hispanic, Jewish, Colombian, Dominican - whatever. They'll make it if it sells. It's a business. It's not personal.","I like a woman who has a vocabulary larger than 'shoes' and 'handbags.' But a nice pair of legs to go in the shoes is always good, too.","I am much more wired to be an athlete than anything else. I understand the 'hard work = payoff' equation in sports. I run marathons and I box. And that's my Puerto Rican flag hanging in Freddie Roach's Wild Card Boxing gym. I gave it to him. My last N.Y.C. marathon time I ran in three hours flat."],"Kirk Cameron":["It is my goal to love everyone. I hate no one. Regardless of their race, religion, their proclivities, the desire of their heart and how they want to live their life and the decisions that they make. I can even respect people's decisions and lifestyle choices just as I hope they have the courtesy to respect my decisions and my choices.","I'm not perfect in my walk but I want to do the right thing.","Every candle that gets lit in the dark room must feel a little rejection from the darkness around it, but the last thing I want from those who hold a different world view to me is to accept me.","What I would say is Jesus came to save lost sinners like you and me, and if Jesus Christ has a burning desire to seek and save the lost, then you should, too, if Christ is living within you. If you don't have a concern for the lost, then I am concerned about your salvation because the Holy Spirit wants the lost to come to Christ.","To me, God comes first, my family come second. If I fail at those two, I'm just playing games.","God steps into the suffering with us, and He takes it on himself, and He walks through it with us, and He uses it to create something in you that is unstoppable.","I came all this way for a reason. Today is the day of salvation. Trust Jesus to save you. Then be sincere as God knows a pretender.","Jesus did not get stuck in intellectual arguments with people. He did not go for the intellect; He went for the conscience. He spoke to that part of the person that knows the difference between right and wrong instinctively.","I'm sure I've lost a few jobs because I'm a Christian. That's irrelevant. I can honestly say that of everything I have, of everything I've experienced, nothing compares to the joy of knowing Christ. Because I've been given a glimpse of Heaven and it outshines all of the rest.","I learned that the problems that we have are not solved by blaming somebody else, and that our hope is not in who governs us as a nation. It's not in Mitt Romney or Barack Obama or Ron Paul. Our hope is in the power of God and his gospel working in the hearts of people.","Marriage is almost as old as dirt, and it was defined in the garden between Adam and Eve. One man, one woman for life till death do you part. So I would never attempt to try to redefine marriage. And I don't think anyone else should either. So do I support the idea of gay marriage? No, I don't.","In any society that is governed by the rule of law, some form of morality is always imposed. It's inescapable.","It does grieve me to think there are people misunderstanding my heart on an issue.","Nobody should mistreat anybody. Homosexuals should not be mistreated. Heterosexuals should not be mistreated. Bisexuals should not be mistreated.","Do I support the idea of gay marriage? No, I don't.","I think God is perfect, all-powerful and has an unstoppable plan for everyone, including those who love him and those who don't.","I believe that freedom of speech and freedom of religion go hand-in-hand in America.","Faith in God... produces character; character will produce courage, courage to face the challenges of the day.","Ten out of ten people die. You start thinking about that and it really makes you start to ask the big questions: Where did I come from? Where am I going when I die? What happens when we step out of here? What's out there?","That's what a family is: a whole bunch of people coming together.","What can separate us from the love of God? Not life, not death, nothing in the present, nothing in the future. Not angels, not demons nothing is able to stand between us and his loving plans because you can't stop them.","We all have our convictions formed by different things, and mine are informed by my faith, they're informed by the Word of God, and I found that to be an anchor for me, a compass and a guide for me. When people start bullying one another and calling each other names for those different convictions, then I think you get into problems.","For me, my family and my faith have been what's really been my anchor, and grounding me, and helping me navigate through a lot of the things that really destroy marriages in Hollywood, and in your own personal integrity.","I think controversy is not always a bad thing. Jesus was controversial. It's through controversy that people often wake up and smell the coffee and say, 'What's going on here? Do we need to rethink something here?'","God is a God who has not given up on His people. If He wanted to give up, He would have given up back in the Garden of Eden.","If my kid came to me and said 'I'm gay,' I'd say, 'Son, I love you.'","I think my biggest problem was, as a celebrity on a TV show, you get an inflated ego and you think you're the center of the universe.","I believe the Scriptures teach that there's a literal heaven and a literal hell, just like Jesus said. And without forgiveness of sins that, yeah, the place of punishment is called hell.","I was experiencing all the success the entertainment industry has to offer, but I knew there had to be something more. It was sort of through that God prepared me to hear about His great plan.","Our first priority is our kids.","I could have anything I wanted and if I didn't have it, it was because I didn't want it.","I was being foolish. An atheist can't stand behind their assertion that God doesn't exist. The stupidest thing I ever could have done was to reject His Truth.","Think of someone you know who's not saved but you may be afraid to share the Gospel with that person. I've found a way that's radically effective in training people to share the Gospel.","Put your nose into the Bible everyday. It is your spiritual food. And then share it. Make a vow not to be a lukewarm Christian.","I sometimes found myself more comfortable around my TV family than I did with my own parents and sister.","The Hollywood lifestyle was just overwhelming. A party here, an interview there, magazine and modeling shoots daily, your face everywhere and girls throwing themselves at you. As great as it felt at the time, I still felt something missing, and that I needed to change.","If we want a great future in this world, we have to take God at his word, and God makes it really clear that society and civilization is held together by the glue of families... This is where the next generation of human beings are incubated and nurtured and matured - in homes. In families.","God's advice trumps Oprah's every time.","Marriage was defined by God a long time ago. Marriage is almost as old as dirt, and it was defined in the garden between Adam and Eve - one man, one woman for life till death do you part. So I would never attempt to try to redefine marriage. And I don't think anyone else should either.","If the anti-Christian agenda will say, 'Here's your identity, you're an evolved amoeba who ought to just go do whatever you want and don't let anybody tell you different,' then they can get you to throw your faith, your character, your courage, and your liberty right out the window.","If you take Darwin's theory and extend it to its logical end, it can be used to justify a number of very horrendous things.","I can assuredly say that it's my life's mission to love all people.","Atheism has been on the rise for years now, and the Bible of the atheists is 'The Origin of Species.'","People want to be liked by other people, so they adopt other people's standards, but for me, my standard had always been true.","I could see that it was God's forgiveness and His mercy that I needed, and that was provided through Christ on the Cross for those who will receive Him as Lord and Savior. That is how I came to Christ.","Everywhere I go, everyone I talk with, everyone I think about - their salvation is what is on my mind. I love fellowship with Christians, but I can't become preoccupied with the pleasure of fellowship when I know that sinners are sinking into hell.","As a father of six kids and as a man who's been transformed by the power of the gospel, I would never just let my kids flounder and just sort of try to figure out their own way through life when I know that I've got the best guide on the planet - God and His word.","You really need to decide, if you're an actor in Hollywood, whether you want to be faithful to the Lord or you want to be popular, because chances are you're not going to be both.","Culture changes because of musicians and actors and actresses. There's a responsibility there. You may ignore the responsibility. You may choose to be a bad role model. But, you are a role model nonetheless.","Once I realized the emptiness of life apart from knowing God, when I embraced God and the truth of the gospel and the truth of the Bible, it was a no-brainer decision to see that that was a treasure that was infinitely more valuable than some sort of an atheistic Hollywood party life.","I'm the kind of person that believes that I would like to be evaluated by my entire career and my entire life, not two words that I would misspeak and then later apologize for.","I love to be creative and to put flesh onto the ideas that are inside of me. And there are not that many great programs that are coming out through Hollywood, and I'm tired of waiting around for someone to hand me a good script, so I'm going to go and produce something.","My default position is not to be an actor. My default position is to be a follower of Jesus Christ. If that means I continue in acting, great! I'd love that. But if it means I need to change professions someday because I can't provide for my family, well, that's what I need to do.","Why do people hate God?... One, they hate the moral standard. Two, they hate the way he's transforming the world even in the midst of suffering and tragedy.","The history of the world is the story of people getting off track.","Professor Hawking is heralded as 'the genius of Britain,' yet he believes in the scientific impossibility that nothing created everything and that life sprang from non-life. Why should anyone believe Mr. Hawking's writings if he cannot provide evidence for his unscientific belief that out of nothing, everything came?","I'm not homophobic.","That pains me in my heart to think that someone who is gay would think that I don't love them and care about them.","I'm a man of convictions. If you press me about how I feel about an issue, you're going to see my convictions.","If my kids came to me and said, 'I'm gay,' I'd say, 'Son, I love you.' That's never at stake. Never, never, never at stake.","I don't think that growing up in the entertainment industry is the healthiest place for kids. The track record kind of shows that.","You either believe marriage and human sexuality are sacred, or you do not.","As I look around, I get this sinking feeling that we're off track, that there's something sick in the soul of our country. I examine the fruit that's hanging on the tree of America, and I can see that it's rotting. And that concerns me deeply.","I'm not the religious-conspiracy-theorist go-to guy, particularly. But I think it's really kind of silly to try to equate birds falling out of the sky with some kind of an end-times theory.","To really understand what love is, you've kinda got to dig down deeper than just how you feel at the moment.","I love the ideas of looking back to historical heroes to give us inspiration on how we can be today's heroes to move forward in the future. So guys like... William Bradford and William Wallace, the Bravehearts, the Patriots, the Pilgrims. There are so many of those people throughout history... whose stories have just never been told.","I have faith in God and not that we have evolved from a rock, not from worshiping the environment or endangered bugs.","The biblical method of change begins in the heart of man with the Gospel. It transforms the mind of man and gradually works its way out. And it builds a nation from the bottom up.","If you press me about how I feel about an issue, you're going to see my convictions.","I love all people. I hate no one. And, you know, when you take a subject and you reduce it to something like a four-second sound bite, and a check mark on a ballot, I think that that's inappropriate and insensitive.","America is a beacon of hope for the world. And yet we are in so much trouble.","My kids haven't watched one episode of 'Growing Pains'. I'll tell you why. When our kids were little, we never wanted Mommy or Daddy to be the celebrity mom or dad to our kids.","Getting into Heaven is not something you can earn or deserve. God makes that really clear in the scriptures.","Some of our kids are adopted and some kids are natural-born - I forget which ones are which. Family's just amazing. We think that of everything that we could do in the world... if you don't take care of your family and raise your kids, you lose.","For so many years, I've been an actor acting in other people's movies, and in 'Unstoppable,' I'm producing it, and I have an opportunity to create some of that excitement with style and form and different color templates and things like that. So, as an artist, it's really exciting.","I've been fortunate that I can be selective enough to do acting when it's really furthering what I want to do with my life.","My wife - I married my onscreen girlfriend from 'Growing Pains', Mike Seaver's girlfriend, and we've been married for 17 years - so marriage is very important to us.","God makes it really clear that society and civilization is really held together by the glue of families... When a man and a woman come together and say 'I do,' they are committing for a lifetime to love each other and to model what love is and what forgiveness is and what joy is to their kids.","The church as a whole has strayed quite far from biblical evangelism; that is, sharing the Gospel in the way that Jesus did, the way the Apostle Paul did, and the rest of the disciples and prophets in Scripture.","When you take a subject and reduce it to something like a four-second sound bite and a check mark on a ballot, I think that that's inappropriate and insensitive.","I love all people; I hate no one.","If America is a ship, it looks a lot like it's sinking - financially, morally, spiritually. It's frightening."],"Kirk Douglas":["In order to achieve anything you must be brave enough to fail.","I guess I was a bad boy... Yes, yes, I've had lots of women in my life.","The learning process continues until the day you die.","Virtue is not photogenic. What is it to be a nice guy? To be nothing, that's what. A big fat zero with a smile for everybody.","No matter how bad things are, they can always be worse. So what if my stroke left me with a speech impediment? Moses had one, and he did all right.","I didn't think I was so tough until I did 'Champion'; then I was a tough guy.","God bless Dad, he came to every one of my shows. I was bad, and I had horrible stage fright. My dad was so relieved - he'd say, 'You were terrible; this kid is not going to be an actor.' Finally, I did a play and he said, 'Son - you were really good.'","I don't need a critic to tell me I'm an actor. I make my own way. Nobody's my boss. Nobody's ever been my boss.","My four sons all knew I was a Jew, but they were allowed to be whatever they wanted to be. The only thing important to me was that they be good people who help other people, because all religion should try to make you a better person and a more caring person. Whenever religion does that for you, it's a good religion.","When you have a stroke, you must talk slowly to be understood, and I've discovered that when I talk slowly, people listen. They think I'm going to say something important!","Acting is make-believe. I never believe I'm the character; I want you to believe.","Why can't a woman be more like a dog, huh? So sweet, loving, attentive.","Sometimes, the thing that ties you down sets you free.","Fifteen years ago, I suffered a stroke, which caused me to lose my speech. Now, what does an actor who can't talk do? Wait for silent pictures to come back? I work with a speech therapist twice a week.","I studied Judaism a lot. I studied religion in general, and I have never imposed my Judaism on my kids. They are what they want to be. I think... you must care for others. That's the correct religion, I think.","Cancer does give you a new rejuvenation. I know what it's like to be down. I lost a couple of good friends - Larry Hagman and Nick Ashford - who had the same type of cancer that I did, and that makes you think.","My first job was on Broadway. Then I went into the Navy. When I came out of the Navy, I went back to Broadway and a friend of mine, Lauren Bacall, was in Hollywood filming with Humphrey Bogart. She told one of her producers I was great in my play, and he saw it and cast me in 'The Strange Love of Martha Ivers'.","If you want to know about a man you can find out an awful lot by looking at who he married.","When you become a star, you don't change - everyone else does.","Love has more depth as you get older.","I came from abject poverty. There was nowhere to go but up.","People are always talking about the old days. They say that the old movies were better, that the old actors were so great. But I don't think so. All I can say about the old days is that they have passed.","People are composed of many things, and in my work, what influences me is the complexity of people - the chiaroscuro of dark and light. When I play a strong guy, I try to find, where is he weak? And, conversely, when I play a weak guy, where is he strong?","Now, what does an actor who can't talk do? Wait for silent pictures to come back?","If I have to speak in public, I am terrified.","Acting is a youthful profession.","I never had any desire to be a film actor. I never thought I was the good-looking movie type, which I assumed they wanted.","All children are natural actors, and I'm still a kid. If you grow up completely, you can never be an actor.","When you reach 95, after you get over your surprise, you start looking back.","What would my parents think about America if they arrived here today? Would they even want to come? I wonder.","I have been an actor for most of my life. When I started out, I didn't think about anything except what was good for me. Like many movie stars, I became all wrapped up in myself.","Fame is as much about luck as it is about talent, perhaps more.","Fear is a terrible thing. It makes you do awful things.","I have one computer that my wife gave me. All I know how to do, and I do it every day, is play Spider Solitaire. And I don't have a cell phone.","You know, you have to have some inner philosophy to deal with adversity.","Listen - pacemaker, crash, stroke. What does it mean? God doesn't want me now. That's all.","I know Italians and I like them. A lot of my father's best friends were Italians.","Too often, I have not been what I wanted to be; I've succumbed to pressures. Yes, I have. The things I've done that I liked, I've always done against advice.","You know, sometimes an interviewer will look at me and say - you're bright! They're actually surprised I might be bright.","If I thought a man had never committed a sin in his life, I don't think I'd want to talk with him. A man with flaws is more interesting.","Sometimes an interviewer will look at me and say, 'You're bright!' They're actually surprised I might be bright.","I love talking to interesting people - people like O.J. Simpson, Andretti... I love champions. A champion has something special about him.","I didn't start out to be a movie star. I started out to be an actor.","My mother, we were a very poor family. When I was a kid, we would be in our little room, and there would be a knock on the door almost every night with a hobo begging for food. Even though we didn't even have enough to eat, my mother always found something to give them.","When I first came to Hollywood, the blacklist was just starting, and they were having hearings in Washington. What most people don't know is the judge of these hearings himself was later convicted of misappropriation. 'Spartacus' helped break the blacklist, because Spartacus was a real character.","I think religion has caused so much catastrophe in the world.","I was living in a terrible time when people were being accused of being communists, and they attacked the movie industry, especially the writers. People couldn't work if they were on the blacklist. The studios banned them. It was the most onerous period in movie history. I don't think we have ever had a period so dark as that.","I was not a very good Jew. I never practised what Judaism tells you to do, to teach your kids all about Judaism.","All my life, I have taken inventory at intervals. For example, when I became a movie actor and suddenly I had to deal with fame, money and playing so many roles, I lost myself. I said, 'Who am I?' And I wrote my first book to deal with that, 'The Ragman's Son.'","I'm an actor; I have made my living by acting, and I almost think I owe it to the public to express my feelings and not as a character on a screen but as myself.","I have studied religion, and I have concluded that there is some power. We don't understand it.","Virtue is not photogenic, so I liked playing bad guys. But, whenever I played a bad guy, I tried to find something good in him, and that kept my contact with the audience.","It's tough to make a movie about movies... We're all too close to it. But 'The Bad and the Beautiful' was very good.","I was conscious of my father's fame from the time I was 6.","Being second generation in Hollywood is complicated: Success is expected, and yet the track record of the second generation is not great. Only a small group of us, like Jane Fonda, have succeeded."],"Kirk Gibson":["Schools used to fund-raise for luxuries, like a trip to the water slides. Now, we fund-raise for things we have to have.","If you're a manager you can't get frustrated and be emotional. You have to continue to steer the ship, you can't let go of the wheel because who knows where it will go then.","I got to experience a world championship with some great teammates.","I'm not out here to win a beauty contest.","I was kind of a volatile personality, very intense. Because of that, I drew some criticism and people would say things about me, and my parents had tried to defend me. I would just tell them don't worry about it. Our day will come.","There was a perception of me, and I earned it because I was really intense, really gruff. I treated certain people poorly at times. It was because of who I was. It was almost my strength. I came in all business. I tried to find ways to fit in with that demeanor, but it's not easy.","Now here I am almost 52 years old, it's really easy. I'm way more at peace. But when you're a competitor, and you're as intent on becoming the best in the world as I was, it comes with consequences."],"Kirk Hammett":["Everyone has a side to them that's kind of unexplained and feels misunderstood.","If a guitar is too easy for me to play, it makes me too laid back. I like to battle with my guitar.","A life lived unexplored is a life not worth living.","After months of playing air guitar to 'Free Bird', what really got me into guitar was watching a documentary about Jimi Hendrix and picking up the Woodstock soundtrack. Listening to his version of 'Star Spangled Banner' and 'Purple Haze.' My brother played acoustic guitar and, idolising him, I thought, 'I'm going to get a guitar.'","I'm death obsessed. You know, I have death all over my house. I have a stuffed two headed sheep!","When people are confronted with something they've never seen before, they really don't know how to react.","Musically, there's a movement called the flatted fifth that's really evil-sounding. It was outlawed by the Catholic Church during the Middle Ages. That movement is what gives you a real evil sound that conjures up dark, fantastic images. It's like an audio horror movie. It personifies what a horror movie is about.","Just because you know umpteen billion scales, it doesn't mean you have to use them all in a solo.","Although I'm a lead guitarist, I'd say that a good 95 percent of my time onstage is spent playing rhythm.","The same sensations that you get in heavy metal are in horror movies. Heavy metal sounds evil and horror movies are evil, ha ha!","Because of things like iTunes and streaming and social networking, it's destroyed music. It's destroyed the motivation to go out there and really make the best record possible. It's a shame.","Deep Purple definitely belongs in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. 'Cause they had great songs, great musicianship, they had an impact, and they're a huge influence on the heavy metal community as a whole.","My guitars are my umbilical cord. They're directly wired into my head.","For me, one of the most perfect times to watch a horror movie is when it's cold and raining outside and there's pretty much no outdoor activity to be done. It kind of sets the mood.","I feel really fortunate that, in playing guitar and surfing, I've found two things that mean so much to me, and which really complement each other. There's definitely a spiritual thing to both of them; they totally connect you to a higher realm.","A lot of the main characters in horror movies are outsiders as well, so that outsider syndrome reverberates within horror fans and geeky collectors. It's kind of a rallying call that brings fans and collectors together who are a little socially retarded, maybe.","We wanted to offer something new to our audience. I hate it when bands stop taking chances.","I would have to say I'm bored with the standard rock, guitar solos, but I've done it for five albums now, and this time I wanted to go in a completely different direction. I wasn't interested in showing off any more.","The concept of clearing one's mind before performing a task so that it is consumed by nothing but that task, yet is open at the same time to anything that might happen - that concept can be applied to playing guitar, and it's enormously helpful for improvising.","I was really, really wild in my early twenties and a bit self-destructive.","I've learned that there's a signature Metallica sound, and if we stray too far from that, our fans get impatient, or they just don't understand, or they miss the point. And I'm not saying that's a good thing or a bad thing; it's just something we have to contend with.","One thing I've noticed over the years is that young players - I mean 10- and 12-year-olds - really like my guitar style. There's something in my guitar style that they totally can latch onto and learn quickly, and then go from there to your Yngwie Malmsteens or your Steve Vais or whatever.","A good horror movie should have peaks and valleys, a good horror movie should move you emotionally; a good horror movie should be exciting to watch and energizing in a weird kind of way.","I fix things all the time. Every time I do a solo, I re-check it and correct things that don't hit the mark.","Metallica is like the phoenix rising from the ashes. We set everything on fire, and this is what has risen from it - 'St. Anger' being the fire and 'Death Magnetic' being the phoenix.","Metallica is a very complicated, fragile thing. On the outside, it's all metal, but on the inside it's very delicate.","Guitar players in the nineties seem to be reacting against the technique oriented eighties.","I love this pedal to death. The only way you could keep me from playing one is by chopping off my legs!","I didn't want to fall into the trap of competing with all these other great guitar players. I just want to sidestep the whole thing and get out of the race.","I don't think success has changed us as people at all. We are the same lunatics that we were when this band first got going. We never see ourselves as being on a higher level than our fans.","I think it's morally wrong to keep someone away from what keeps him happy.","I think it goes without saying that a lot of big horror fans are just nerds and geeks.","Horror movies started to wane around the onset of World War II, and after World War II, when all the troops came home, people weren't really interested in seeing horror movies, because they had the real horror right on their front doorsteps.","I've been into horror movies ever since I was five years old.","I feel like I've matured more musically than I have personally. But I totally embrace what becoming older has to offer. I find the wisdom that comes with each passing year is a trip.","My musical tastes change every week.","Jeff Beck is one of my heroes and has been since I first picked up a guitar.","It really shocked me just to hear of the fans' response to 'St. Anger' not having guitar solos.","When I see my kids totally into their Legos, it brings me back to the days I was hanging out and playing with my monster models. It brings me there in a second.","Guitar playing is both extremely easy for me and extremely difficult for me at the same time.","There's something about a wah pedal that really gets my gut going! People will probably say, 'He's just hiding behind the wah.' But that isn't the case. It's just that those frequencies really bring out a lot of aggression in my approach.","Getting sequestered and not really knowing what to do with your time and then discovering, 'Oh, I can watch a bunch of horror movies' has probably played out in a lot of people's discovery of horror.","I love 'True Blood.' I love 'The Walking Dead.' Those are fantastic series.","One of my favorite horror films of the Nineties was 'Event Horizon.'","I love horror movies in space. I love it when the genre switches over and what was sci-fi becomes horror.","If I had unlimited funds, wall space and storage, I would collect a lot more things, like 'Planet of the Apes,' 'Star Wars,' science fiction stuff, autographs, and prop guns and weapons. I have to draw the line somewhere.","When you're first starting out, there's always the temptation to hide behind distortion because it lets you get away with murder. But, when it comes to rhythm work, you've gotta back off that gain control a bit, especially if you're playing with another guitarist.","I've always been attracted to the darker things in life. I was never one to go for light, airy stuff, even as a child. My whole aesthetic has always been one of the darker side. That rings true also in my tastes in music. It's just always something I've gravitated to naturally.","The word 'retirement' doesn't really sit well with me. There comes a time when you reach a position in society or culture where people will not let you retire. You can say, 'Alright, I'm going to hang up my guitar,' but people will still not let you retire.","For a while I was collecting Satan and devil stuff - you know, anything that had to do with old Beelzebub or Lucifer. But I had to put the brakes on it, because there's a lot of stuff out there, and the collection was just growing too quickly.","It's definitely true that Stevie Ray Vaughan is one of my all-time favorite guitarists.","The movie 'Black Cat,' from 1934, is one of my favorite movies.","When I got my first Marshall amp, it was so empowering. No one ever forgets their first Marshall amp if you're a guitar player pursuing a big powerful sound. I mean, no one ever forgets their first Marshall amp.","Technology has given us convenience, but at the same time it's making musicians work harder in that if you really want to make money making music and selling albums, you have to go out there and perform. And hope you sell stuff like merch, and get on YouTube, and all the other ancillary sort of things that go along with that.","I've always loved horror, I've always loved collecting, I've always loved weird and macabre things, and I've always loved conventions. So what could be better than having your own Fear FestEviL where all those great and crazy things can be enjoyed by like-minded people under one pretty cool roof? Nothing!","For the 'Load' album, I was experimenting so much with tone that I had to keep journals on what equipment I was using. For 'Hero of the Day,' I know I used a 1958 Les Paul Standard with a Matchless Chieftain, some Boogie amps and a Vox amp - again, they're all blended.","Much of my playing is rhythmic and choppy; I use a lot of double stops. The wah just accents all those stops and chops and brings out the rhythmic aspect that much more.","The only problem I've had with my Vox wah is its tendency to move around on the floor. So now it sits on a rubber mat that says in big letters, 'Kirk's Wah-Wah Rug.'","On 'Metallica,' I recorded six or seven different guitar solos for almost every song, took the best aspects of each solo, mapped out a master solo and made a composite. Then I learned how to play the composite solo, tightened it up and replayed it for the final version.","I went through a whole blues period in the Nineties, and that had some influence on 'Load' and 'ReLoad.'","For 'Death Magnetic,' I used what I always use, which is my standard touring rack, which is filled with some Boogie stuff and a Marshall that I've had forever.","Ampeg made incredible guitar heads in the early Nineties and then stopped. And I don't know why. The one we used had a nice clean, warm sound, and it blended well with the other amps that were in the studio."],"Kirk Kerkorian":["When you're a self-made man, you start very early in life. In my case it was at 9 years old when I started bringing income into the family. You get a drive that's a little different, maybe a little stronger, than somebody who inherited.","I'm far from being reclusive. I have 30- or 40-year friendships that I prefer to meeting new people. I go to an occasional party, but just because I don't go to a lot of events, and I'm not out in public all the time doesn't mean I'm anti-social or a recluse.","I do stay busy. I like new challenges.","You have to ask a lot of questions and listen to people, but eventually, you have to go by your own instincts.","I used to think that if I made $50,000 I'd be the happiest guy in the world.","I don't try to get all the meat off the bone. When I get a good figure, I just move something. Too many people try to hit the peak price, and they hold on until it is too late.","I've always been a quiet guy.","Life is a big craps game. I've got to tell you, it's all been fun.","I have some eye problems from when I was a pilot.","I exercise a lot. I try to stay healthy.","I'm a very passive investor.","I wish I could talk like Donald Trump or Steve Wynn. Hell, I'd love it.","I'm a gambler at heart. That's my life."],"Kirsten Dunst":["You can never control who you fall in love with, even when you're in the most sad, confused time of your life. You don't fall in love with people because they're fun. It just happens.","I'm very mature for my age, but I'm also innocent in a lot of ways.","Confidence is very sexy. You could be not cute at all and have such confidence.","I'm happiest when I'm just hanging out with my friends... it really doesn't matter what we do.","You don't really know who you're going to fall in love with at what time in their life. They can be the worst off they've ever been in their life, but you can't help who you fall in love with. That's part of the excitement of life - new people, new experiences.","You know that feeling when you wake up in the morning and you're excited for the day? That's one of my main goals in life.","I just don't want to be the damsel in distress. I'll scream on the balcony, but you've got to let me do a little action here.","But the real secret to total gorgeousness is to believe in yourself, have self confindence, and try to be secure in your decisions and thoughts.","I don't find I'm manic at all. I'm very chill.","I don't really relate to myself as The Girl in the Magazine. Which is dangerous for me, too, sometimes, because I don't think all the time, 'Well, look to see if people are following me home.' Sometimes I'm a little bit more free than maybe I should be.","Why would I cry over a boy? I would never waste my tears on a boy. Why waste your tears on someone who makes you cry?","I have gotten so many tickets. I hope I don't get my license revoked.","I feel very lucky that I don't have to rely on a man to give me financial security. That's a big deal.","Everyone goes through a hard time in their life.","What are you going to do if it's the end of the world? You better go out having fun instead of stressing about it.","When I was little, I put on plays for my family at Sunday dinner, and I would direct them and have all my cousins, my brother, and my best friends in it. I was a very imaginative and theatrical child and wasn't afraid of being in front of a camera. It was like make-believe to me.","If I saw 'Virgin Suicides' or 'Eternal Sunshine,' I'm so proud to be in those movies. They are such great movies. I felt so free on those sets.","I liked the girly cartoons. I was very much a girly-girl.","Doing 'All Good Things' really felt like I was acting for myself rather than anyone else. It gave me a freedom I'd never had before, or knew I had, to do whatever I want to, and to argue my opinions and not just feel like the cute girl on set or the girl in a boy's club. I figured out how I could be both. And it's been different ever since.","The more I see and know about life, the more ideas I have and the more I want to make art.","I want to play an action hero. I'm ready for roles that totally aren't me.","I really wanted the MTV Award the most, It was a golden popcorn container and it looks really neat.","I'm never going to say anything about who I'm dating unless I'm married or engaged.","I wanted to get an angel wings tatooed on my back, as a guardian thing.","I was a very extrovert kid. It felt normal to me to act. I always went to regular schools. I've never been catty or a prima donna, so I never had problems. I always had my seat at the cafeteria when I came back from acting.","I've always been someone who is pretty hard on herself. But I've lightened up a lot.","I just want to be a good friend to people, that's all.","When you have a beanpole body, everything looks cute. Like Alexa Chung. I like her style, but she's really tall and skinny, so everything looks good on her.","I was a big Guns N' Roses fan when I was seven. My friend who lived across the street had long dark curly hair and I had long blonde hair, so I'd dress up as Axl and she'd be Slash, and we'd rock out in front of the mirror singing 'Patience.'","Everybody has a mean streak in them, don't they?","I think the best thing about my job is that I have my life documented, which not many people get to have. They have a photo here and there and maybe some video footage from a birthday. My kids will be able to see me growing up.","I love to produce, and I've directed two short films.","I would love to work with Quentin Tarantino - he's my number one. My ultimate. I would love to work with Paul Thomas Anderson, Alexander Payne - Pedro Almodovar wouldn't be too shabby. There are so many good directors, but those are some of my favorites.","Boys frustrate me. I hate all their indirect messages, I hate game playing. Do you like me or don't you? Just tell me so I can get over you.","Everybody smokes! Models, actresses, everyone! Don't they realize that it's gross? I understand it's an addiction, but it still pains me to see my friends do it.","I try not to do scenes a certain way, because then I become conscious of it, and it dosen't come off as realistic. I try to make it so that I'm not really aware of what I'm doing.","I'd like to grow up and be beautiful. I know it doesn't matter, but it doesn't hurt.","I'd like to be taller. I'd like my baby fat to leave.","People always tell me, 'Don't work so much', but I can't help it. I feel like all the things I've done are important to get to this adult stage and now I'm getting all these adult offers, so it's working.","The hardest job an actor can do is all this pretend, all this screaming and being scared for your life.","My mother told me that when I was born a wave of feeling came over her. She just knew that I was destined to be an actress.","When you spend your entire life as a child actress, being told where to go and where to stand, you're performing constantly for people. It definitely breeds the kind of person who's dependent on other people's approval.","I can't wait to have kids one day. I want to have kids and a farm with lots of animals on a lake.","I feel like I could never walk around a film half-naked. I definitely wouldn't want to see that.","I'm not someone who feels the pressure of someone else's expectations. That's a very young way to feel.","A lot of people my age, they grew up with me onscreen. I think that's helped keep a certain amount of longevity. When you grow up with a person, you feel like you know them.","It's weird doing red carpets; it's uncomfortable. But you can have a sense of humor about it.","When I was younger, I always did movies that teenagers would watch, not adults. I did 'Crazy/Beautiful' or comedies like 'Bring It On.'","I think every woman goes through a relationship where she is with a guy that is really not right for her. You get lost in it.","You can never get enough of 'Jeopardy.'","I really think the key to a film is the chemistry of people.","I would always rather do a mediocre script with a great filmmaker than a great script with a mediocre filmmaker.","I'm not a very 'this is planned out' person when I get to set. 'This is how I'm going to do it' - I'm never like that.","Most people ask me questions based on a previous interview. That's not an interview. It's like they're just saying my quotes back to me.","I'm the kind of person who buys a new thing, wears it so much and then is totally sick of it.","I attract a different kind of boy when my hair's red. I get more quality men - like a more thoughtful, nerdy dude.","I really want to do a film in another language. My dad's from Germany, so it'd be really cool to do a film in German. I'm not quite fluent, but I can get there. And my accent's pretty good. I wouldn't feel too out of my element.","Pristine vulnerability is just so boring to me. The performances that I love are ones like Gena Rowland's in 'A Woman Under the Influence,' where women are allowed to be messy and imperfect. It's that kind of woman that has always inspired me to seek roles that are a little out of the box. I just haven't always had the opportunity to do them.","I feel like everyone directs their own career according to their taste, what they migrate to emotionally and what kind of artists they want to work with. And I'm lucky enough to be in a position where I can wait six months for a project that really interests me.","The filmmaker is really important to me: it could be their first film; it's not just about their reputation, but I have to really believe in them.","I don't want to be 'box-office girl,' but I don't want to be 'that indie girl' either.","When I'm an old lady, I'm going to have my pick of the young men. They'll be like, 'She's Miss Mary Jane!' The young boys will think I'm a hot old lady.","I'm a person who likes to hang out. I would never go on a blind date. That sounds like the most uncomfortable thing on the planet earth. It's like, 'Hi. Nice to meet you. So, what kind of music do you like?' Date ended.","I don't think roles help you resolve your issues. I just think they're good markers.","I used to feel like I had to be the best at what I did, but I realized I don't have to be the best. It's so freeing. I've never been this happy.","Being an actress doesn't make you popular in school.","It's important to me that I don't get trapped in the whole teen scene, because I feel that you can get lost in those kind of movies, and they aren't really about the actors; they're about the selling of the concept, and how much money it makes.","You really can't explain how you do the things you do. I can't, anyway. I love certain actors, but sometimes they say the stupidest things about technique. I don't want to say something stupid.","It's hard to get lost in a scene, to get into a character when everyone's standing around you on the set.","A lot of people my age who are working right now have never acted; they get a show and suddenly they're making millions. It's always those people who get it fast who have the most trouble staying grounded and being themselves.","I think most human beings go through some sort of depression in their life. And if they don't, I think that's weird.","I don't live in the spotlight, and I don't live my life in front of the paparazzi. I live very comfortably and quietly as possible.","When I go away to do a movie, I bring the blanket I've had since I was a little girl. It helps me sleep. I also always bring my laptop so I can E-mail friends. And I bring my dog, Beauty, wherever I can.","When I have time off, my friends and I will go to Universal Studios, the movies, out to eat, and shopping. I'm happiest when I'm just hanging out with my friends... it really doesn't matter what we do.","I never read comics as a kid. I guess I was lazy and watched cartoons instead.","When you get older, you feel better about yourself. You're not worried what other people think about you, in general. You just get more comfortable in your skin.","I've been an REM fan since I was a little girl. I would jump around to 'Stand' in the mirror.","Every movie I do, I always use things that have happened in my life. Funny moments, anything. If it just sticks out I'll write it down and use that, too, because it has to come out of you. But no one can work when they're depressed. I don't think I'd physically be able to do it if I were depressed.","When I'm working, I always listen to music to zone everyone else out.","In high school I had a boyfriend who was super into rap, so I was into Too $hort and Wu-Tang for a little while. And my best friend's older brother would sometimes drive us home in this pimped-out truck, and he'd play all his dirty rap music. We thought we were really cool.","I can't imagine having a real personal thing, like divorce and marriage, all those things, being in the public eye. I try to not talk about anything personal, and then nobody has the fire to throw back at you, like 'You said this back then!'","I'm a good assistant. That's why I don't have an assistant, because I'm so on it that no one can be as on it as me. I know that.","I've always used my own personal emotions and things that I've gone through in my life to build a character. The work that I do before a film feels almost like therapy, between me and whoever I'm playing.","I don't try to be sexy, but if you are sexy it comes out. If you're not, you're not.","I like people more undone than made up. Patricia Arquette is the ultimate. She's not anorexic or perfectly tan, she's not trying to be anything but what she is, and that's the most sexy thing.","What actor do you really take seriously who becomes a singer? It's kind of ridiculous. I can't think of anybody.","After 'Melancholia' and 'On the Road,' I wanted to do a comedy. And I did so many comedies when I was younger, but if you're not consistently in those movies, people don't always think of you for them.","I'm always looking for that movie that feels like it's hitting me where I need it.","If you're successful at a young age, no matter the profession, there has to come a time when you reevaluate everything, what it means to you. 'Is this what I want to do for the rest of my life?'","When you're little, you're open to things. It's not like you get into this rehearsed zone when you're a child. At first you play different sides of yourself. And I think it will be really exciting one day to have a character to go into that's not anything like me whatsoever.","When you feel good is when you're not afraid to feel the worst.","I think you see in people's eyes what they've been through. Anything in their lives shows up in their eyes.","You know how people say awards don't mean anything? Hello! I think the energy around them makes everyone cuckoo.","I would have loved to have been in a Hitchcock movie.","New York vintage is too expensive!","It's such a private thing - 'my process' - I can just say that the work that I do is like therapy between me and the character.","My grandmother lives with my mother in a gorgeous house in the San Fernando Valley. I am afforded these luxuries, and I'm very young.","I think it's best to date someone who doesn't do what you do.","If I'd trusted myself and listened to myself all the times that I ignored myself, I would have been fine. But everyone has to learn their lesson, and now I've got it.","It's always nice when people appreciate your work because it means you've affected them, which is great. And so that feels good.","I was a very imaginative and theatrical child and wasn't afraid of being in front of a camera.","A lot of moms give their kids line reads. My mom wasn't put in that position because I always had an acting teacher helping with the feelings rather than how to say something.","I think for everyone it's good to have your own personal work on a character and a film before you even start rehearsing, to have an inner life.","The performances that I love are ones like Gena Rowlands in 'A Woman Under the Influence,' where women are allowed to be messy and imperfect. It's that kind of woman that has always inspired me to seek roles that are a little out of the box. I just haven't always had the opportunity to do them.","I feel like everyone directs their own career according to their taste, what they migrate to emotionally and what kind of artists they want to work with.","I've been lucky to find people who want to work with me, whom I respect and like, but the truth is there aren't that many good projects out there. And we make way, way too many movies. So it's not always going to happen with every project. But I try and wait it out.","I know kids are supposed to go through these awkward stages, but I just never even thought about that. I was too busy worrying about getting my education while I was working.","I hate red-carpet photographs!","I don't gossip about myself.","I've never had a teenage rebellion; I'm not that type of person. I always work out my problems in a conscientious way.","I've always had a process that I do before I even get to set or go to the location. I work privately, and it almost feels like therapy between me and who I'm playing. So I have this inner life that's there and it gives me a confidence, too, that when I'm playing the role I know every question.","I built my entire career off of teen comedies. I was in 'Bring It On'."],"Kirsten Gillibrand":["A strong mentor can help a young woman find and advance in the career of her dreams that otherwise may have seemed impossible.","The horrific damage of 9/11 did not end when those buildings came down.","If we expect our children to thrive at our colleges and universities, and succeed in our economy once they graduate - first we must make quality, affordable early childhood education accessible to all.","While we can never truly repay the debt we owe our heroes, the least we should do for our brave veterans is to ensure that the government takes a proactive approach to delivering the services and benefits they have earned, so they can access the care they need and so richly deserve.","Use your voice on the local level where it has the potential to be more widely heard.","By running, you're making that commitment that says, 'I'm dedicating myself to public service.' Win or lose, you're making that statement, and you actually are taking a step in that direction.","A strong and dedicated mentor can help a young woman get her foot in the door, get a promotion and get a raise.","I find that when you open the door toward openness and transparency, a lot of people will follow you through.","Obesity puts our children at risk of developing serious diseases - such as Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and depression. It keeps our children from performing their best at school.","Sexism is alive and well in politics, as it is in all industries.","When we create hope and opportunity in the lives of others, we allow love, decency and promise to triumph over cowardice and hate.","Health care should be a right; it should never be a privilege. We should have Medicare for all in this country.","I love celebrating Mother's Day. Since I was a kid, it was a special day to tell my mother and grandmother how much I love them. Now that I'm a mom, it is a special day to spend with my children.","The brave men and women who have served - and those who continue to serve - our armed forces have selflessly sacrificed for our nation, and we owe it to them to provide the best services and protections available when they're overseas and after they return home.","While we can't begin to repay the debt we owe our veterans for their brave service, we can certainly take steps to ease the physical, psychological and financial hardships they may be experiencing.","If everyone in America can easily see who and what their lawmakers are requesting taxpayer money for, we can keep elected officials honest, end the days of political, special interest favors, and reduce wasteful spending.","Put a lawn sign on your lawn; go door to door for your candidate. Register people to vote. There's so much we can do through our voices and time. That's what flips elections.","My hope is that in the future, women stop referring to themselves as 'the only woman' in their physics lab or 'only one of two' in their computer science jobs.","Hardworking men and women deserve not only job security, but also a paycheck when they need to take time off to care for a loved one.","As we all know, there is no harder or more rewarding job than being a mom.","We must do everything we can to help our service members and veterans transition into civilian life once they return home, and that means preparing them for the tough job market.","Nurses are on the front lines of our care. And they need to be at the foundation of health care reform. Let's get health care done - and done right - by ensuring the amount of nurses we need to provide quality care for all.","I've never lived through a moment in history where people are using their voices and becoming strong advocates for what they believe in.","The silver lining of the Trump presidency is it is an era of activism, and one where women really want to be heard.","I really love my job, and I feel like I can make a huge difference for New Yorkers, fighting for them.","I was new at my job, and I needed to address my inexperience and weaknesses head-on.","Along with a livable wage, many parents are desperate for quality affordable child care.","Communities in every corner of America struggle to fill nursing vacancies to provide care for everyone who needs it.","For American families, Universal pre-K is an essential piece of the puzzle that not only allows their kids to get a good start, but it also allows mothers to remain on the job earning a paycheck and helping our economy grow.","It's time to focus on real solutions that will create jobs and build our economy for real strength and stability - not just for the fortunate few, but for every American.","Empowering women in the workforce is a key to growing the economy and having a thriving middle class.","Just telling women: If you don't speak up, things aren't gonna change. If you don't become an advocate, it's not gonna change. If you don't vote, it's not gonna change. If you don't run, it's not gonna change.","I think the wall is stupid; it's a waste of the taxpayer's money. We need the money for job growth, infrastructure, 100 other things... it sends a bad message.","America is the only high income nation without a paid family leave program. This means that if you or a family member gets sick, there is no guarantee that you can take the time you need to take care of yourself or your loved one, leaving already vulnerable families in the position of making hard decisions in cases of illness.","If one of my colleagues wants to block a bill, they should stand up in front of the American people and explain why.","I believe transparency in government is key to restoring our nation's faith in its elected leaders.","In addition to being an economic security issue, the failure to pay women a salary that's equal to men for equal work is also a women's health issue. The fact is that the salary women are paid directly impacts the type of health care services they are able to access for both themselves and their families.","The American people deserve to know that their elected leaders play by the exact same rules that they play by and that their lawmakers' only interest is what's best for the country, not their own financial gain.","When they return home from serving our country, our National Guard and Reserve members shouldn't have to be confronted with red tape in order to access the benefits they've earned fighting for our country.","Like all Americans, I will never forget where I was the morning of the 9/11 attacks.","For me, getting off the sidelines means women making a difference by letting their voices be heard on the issues they care about.","I have not been in Washington very long, but I've been there long enough to be shocked by how antiquated some of our laws have become.","When women earn more, families are stronger, and children have better access to quality health care and education.","For many of the brave men and women who have fought on the front lines, returning home means trying to navigate a complicated and bureaucratic Veterans Administration benefits system.","One of the primary reasons I first ran for Congress was to be a voice for our troops, veterans and military families.","Discriminatory wage practices undermine women's ability to provide for their families and survive on a decent retirement income.","I'm fighting to make childcare more affordable for working parents so they can continue working and advancing their careers, closing wage gaps that for too long have held women back from the fair economic opportunities they need.","Instead of marginalizing women, Congress must get to work on policies that can foster job creation and fuel economic growth.","The men and women who lived through and came to our rescue on 9/11 were not Democrats or Republicans or Independents. They were Americans first and foremost, and so were the people they saved.","There is no greater call to service than that of our brave men and women who serve our country in combat across the globe.","When I was first elected to the House in 2006, it was important to me to send a clear message to the people of NY-20: I wanted to be a representative for the people and shed some light on their government, so I became the first member of Congress to post my schedule, my financial disclosures and my earmark requests all online.","As Congress focuses on comprehensive health care reform, one thing needs to be clear: We cannot fix health care if we do not address America's nursing shortage.","If we're going to be able to provide access to quality, affordable health care to every American - we need to have the trained health care professionals inside hospitals to provide that care.","The government can take smart steps to give all kids the healthy start they need to reach their full potential.","When mothers earn their fair share, young children have greater access to quality health care, educational opportunities, and safe communities. By ending the wage gap, we will help ensure that every child can achieve his or her God-given potential.","I look at each nominee. If they suck, I vote against them. If they're worthy, I vote for them.","We can work with anybody. I mean, we passed the 9/11 health bill with Tom Cotton. Most people would assume I wouldn't be able to work with Tom Cotton and Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.","The press pool was taking bets on how many months I would last. There was nobody in the state who thought I had any shot at being a good senator.","I was a tennis player in high school and college.","I went to the Women's Campaign School at Yale; I went to Eleanor Roosevelt Legacy Training, women's campaign fund training. I got to know the district really well by talking to the county chair, getting to know politics, working on some local races.","Sometimes you're going to run because you want to elevate an issue. Sometimes you're going to run because you want to do public service, and it's a way to not only tell the community what you care about what you want to achieve, but you're making a commitment.","To change Washington, you need to change the women's player list.","I can't tell you how many 30-year-old dudes believe they should be senator or president. Women, we're like, 'Well, maybe after ten years of working...' No. Just run for the office you want to run for and run on the issue you want to fix.","When we do our legislation, we're not trying to figure out, 'How can I use this to run against you?' We say, 'How can we pass this bill to help both of our constituents?'","I'm grateful that President Trump is willing to talk about paid leave, but his policy, unfortunately, is woefully inadequate.","We'd certainly have paid leave already by now, we'd have equal pay, we'd have a living minimum wage - a lot of things would change having that diversity of opinion in Washington. We certainly wouldn't be debating whether women should have access to birth control.","It's a heavy feeling being in Washington. There are so many important issues at risk. You're in a fighting stance every day.","The attack on the transgender troops - disgusting, disgraceful, outrageous. It's just endless. And then you try to do your day job of finding good bipartisan work across the aisle... You're doing both all the time. I guess I would describe it as intense. Everything is very intense.","A lot of members of Congress are isolated. They tend to be affluent. They tend to have a lot of people doing things for them. So sometimes they don't understand what their constituents are feeling.","I didn't know how to pass a major piece of legislation; I didn't know how to get colleagues to support my views. It took a lot of asking for advice and learning. One of the lessons is that you have to be able to tell people why you care, and you're only going to be able to do that if you talk to someone whom an issue is affecting."],"Kirsten Green":["Retail is undergoing a massive change, and there is a chance for new leaders to emerge and older brands to reinvent themselves.","The customer wants what the customer wants - when they want it, where they want it, and how they want it. And if you want to build a big business, and you want to be meaningful to a big, broad group of customers, you need to think about how you're going to meet them in the various places where they might expect to see you.","One thing that is unique to Stadium Goods is that they have a consolidated view of everything that is going on in the footwear ecosystem because they are connecting with customers, both buyers and sellers of sneakers, in so many different places.","I optimize for brands and people I enjoy spending time with - we've invested in Warby Parker, Glossier, Outdoor Voices, Bonobos - because if you're having a good time, you're inherently going to be better at what you're doing. Even the bad times are tolerable when you're working alongside people you respect and like.","People need role models, and they need to feel that there's this opportunity to learn. They need to have people that will stick up for them. I want to be a part of that.","Last-mile efficiencies is a big trend. It's something that consumers have demonstrated that they want and existing businesses are trying to figure out and new businesses are rising up to.","We need to have more women founders stepping up to kind of own their own story and ask for what they want and tell success stories and start really building confidence that these stories are out there.","We never invest in a male; we never invest in a female. We just invest in the right entrepreneur.","I was a woman and younger. I started spending a lot of time in the mall doing a lot of qualitative research and really watching what consumers were doing. Were they gravitating towards the sales racks, or were they looking at the new fashions? Were they there to shop, or were they there to socialize?","Most things that people want already exist, and with Amazon or eBay, there is always someone who is willing to undercut your price.","I am giddy with enthusiasm when my companies are doing well. And my heart hurts when they're not. Maybe that sounds very cheesy, but that's the reality of my life right now.","I don't have a gender thesis. I am truly optimizing for the right person for the task, whether that means running a company or working on my team.","With the way Amazon and eBay had become big companies and with the way people were embracing technology, I was like, it is so obvious that this is going to be a huge game changer in this space. The combination of these things is going to change what it means to retail, what it means to launch brands, what it means to connect with your consumer.","The way I shop and the way I engage with my wardrobe, those experiences don't come to life on Amazon's platform.","So many entrepreneurs view their companies as their babies. They micromanage, and they stall.","I'd like to think my strengths are in connecting with people and the relationship aspect of this business.","Wouldn't it be so cool if we could use the Internet to build a better beauty brand?","Retail is now totally propelled by consumers and their needs. People can buy what they want in any way that they want it. That trend started a long time ago, and it has really changed everything.","My face wash is the thing I care about the most. I don't think I've ever gone to bed without washing my face. I switch it up. I use Obagi Nu-Derm Gentle Cleanser or Lait U Biologique Recherche in the morning or at night.","As I get older, I feel like I look better with less makeup. More makeup just creases more and looks like you tried too hard to cover up a bunch of stuff, versus 'OK, I've got decent skin, and that's what I'm going with.'","Mascara is the only makeup I actually care about - I've tried them all. I use Diorshow when I'm trying to be fancy, but for every day, I use Blinc.","To be a good investor, you have to think differently from others.","I don't love it when people come in and say, 'We need a woman on our board,' or 'Can you invest in this new shopping app because you like to shop?' But whatever gets me in the deal.","In 1990, if I wanted a pair of Calvin Klein jeans I had seen in a magazine, I'd head to the mall, sift through piles of inventory to find my size, try them on, ask the opinion of the often inexperienced sales associate, wait in line to check out, pay, and head home. The process was linear and ripe for improvement.","In 2010 - after raising capital to launch Forerunner Ventures - we aimed to invest in companies targeting digitally savvy customers looking to be delighted by experiences and founded by visionary leaders committed to leveraging data and quantifying the results."],"Kirsten Nelson":["I wanted to be a concert pianist at Carnegie Hall; that is what I wanted to do from really early on. I actually was the accompanist for a couple of the musicals I was in growing up.","I knew Kathy Joosten; we worked together on a very short-lived series called 'Thanks' for CBS.","I wanted to be a concert pianist at Carnegie Hall; that is what I wanted to do from really early on.","I actually was the accompanist for a couple of the musicals I was in growing up.","I am capable of directing, and I am good at that. In order to have longevity as actors, you have to keep changing it up a bit; you have to bring other talents to the table. I want this to be another feather in my cap instead of replacing what I already have."],"Kirsten Prout":["There's nothing better than sinking into my feather pillows after a hard day's work.","I always find the worst lies are told in relationships - I learned to never lie about your happiness in order to save someone's feelings from being hurt.","I like sundresses with cowboy boots, little shorts with big wedge heels and a big piece of turquoise. I also love classic, Old Hollywood romantic styles. I'm 'country girl meets city girl' circa 1930.","I dated a guy for over a year who lied about his age the entire time. I found out after the fact and couldn't believe it! I even threw him a birthday party for the wrong age... I couldn't get over how hard he had tried to keep it a secret!","Being a part of the 'Twilight' phenomenon was life-changing; there is a whole other world of 'Twilight' fandom!","I have my sweetheart Yorkshire terrier, Tabasco, along with two cats, Romeo and Jasmine. Yes, I am both a Shakespeare and Disney addict.","One of my favorites to order in fancy restaurants is escargot.","Performances are always more interesting to me when something is at stake.","As for dream roles, they usually just speak to you. I just crave complex characters.","I have always loved story - I escaped within it as a child, I read every day, I love figuring out the complex layers of an author's work.","I really love Natalie Portman; she's the real deal."],"Kirsten Storms":["I don't want to be perceived as someone who has it all figured out. I certainly don't feel entitled or like I'm a superstar. I'm still growing, learning, and figuring things out.","In the grand scheme of things, a lot more women go through this than I think people realize or talk about, so that wasn't a problem for me as far as saying that I have endometriosis."],"Kirsten Sweetland":["Natural ability is important, but you can go far without it if you have the focus, drive, desire and positive attitude.","I'm appreciative of things going wrong. At first it sounds crazy, but how boring would life be if you just coasted along without any challenges? Without learning about who you really are through the process of going through the darker times? Without feeling the sense of elation when you reach even a small stepping stone?","I've always found when I'm healthy and happy I perform the best, not necessarily when I've done the most training.","Never in my heart did I want to quit, but I did, at the end of 2012, start to wonder when I was getting fractures from running hardly at all; I started thinking, 'Am I asking too much of my body? Is it not going to do this for me anymore?'","I'm a coffee addict. I think I buy, like, four a day. I'm not even jittery from it any more.","I would like to be the best in the world, but that's not the be-all and end-all. I want to have fun in my sport, and I want to take it as far as I can. Obviously, I do have big goals like that. But they don't take over who I am as a person and my family and everything else that's important in my life.","That's something I never want to do: I never want to think I know it all, because I don't. There's always more people with more advice, and I just want to soak all that up and make my sporting toolbox as full as I can get it."],"Kirsten Vangsness":["I am a big believer in letting your own personal freak flag fly.","'Fiancee' is a very fun word to say, because I never thought I would have a fiancee or be a fiancee. Sometimes when I would introduce myself and say, 'This is my girlfriend Melanie,' it wasn't always clear what I meant. Now I get to say, 'This is my fiancee Melanie.'","I dress like a 7-year-old space pilot. I have clothes that I still wear regularly from high school.","I am always sort of delightedly surprised when someone recognizes me because as far as I'm concerned, I'm just going to work and getting paid to act, and that alone is fantastic; I forget people watch it, too.","I started writing because it was hard to find acting jobs. I didn't like any monologues in auditions, so I started to write my own things. Since then, I have written a couple of shows. I was nominated for playwright of the year for a play I wrote called 'Potential Space.'","I like writing about what to me are like questions that I have about myself and the human condition. I find quantum physics fascinating, so I like to write about that, and I like things that make me laugh.","On television, you have an intimate moment with the camera. In theater, you are making something live with people there. My brain doesn't understand that you don't get another take ever. I'm finally learning on TV that you can do something over if you make a mistake.","I'm on the advisory board of Alex's Lemonade Stand, which is a children's cancer charity. I'm so proud to be on that and help them.","I'm really proud of being part of that whole geek/chic, girl nerds, glasses are sexy and all of that because I think it's true. In America, I don't know about in other places, but there is this mythology about the way a woman is supposed to be and look and act and that's what makes them sexy. And I love being the alternative to that.","I dress a little strange. I dress a little theatrically.","I am a theater girl, and a lot of theater girls dress however pleases them. I wear whatever looks good on me. I wear what I wear because I have been shopping at thrift stores since I was five.","I like dressing how I like to dress, and I look like a little art statement.","From the time I was about 7 until I was about 13 or 14, I looked like I was Pat from 'Saturday Night Live.' I'm not exaggerating, remotely.","I didn't want that 15 minutes of fame moment like, 'Oh, she said she was gay.'","You would never argue about a straight girl playing a lesbian. Everybody still watched 'The L Word.' I feel like we have such great role models, like Jane Lynch and Jodie Foster and all these people that you don't even think about."],"Kirstie Alley":["You'll never be disappointed if you always keep an eye on uncharted territory, where you'll be challenged and growing and having fun.","I'm happy when I'm juggling, but I feel like I've gone from, like, 3 balls to 10 bowling balls. But, that's a good problem. I don't really have a complaint about that.","When I was straight, I had the courage and energy to become an actress. I owe my career to my will to stop using.","There's a lot more to life than how fat or thin you are.","I binge when I'm happy. When everything is going really well, every day is like I'm at a birthday party.","It was the greatest thing in the world getting fat. Every meal out was an event. Or we'd go to Italy and we'd have pasta, truffles, and dessert and then plan the next incredible meal. It was a happy-go-lucky time. I never had so much fun.","I've been irresponsible many, many, many times and that has resulted in my being fat.","You're not going to live your life unscathed.","When you're the spokeswoman for a weight-loss program, everything is witnessed. I weigh in once a week with a witness. I have to sign an affidavit saying I cannot have any surgeries.","When push comes to shove, it ain't the science that's going to lift you up - it's the belief, the spiritual side of life, that's going to lift you up, no matter what religion you are.","When I see someone who is starved, they don't look alert. They don't have boundless energy. If you're too skinny, it looks like you're near death.","When I play ball, I play hardball.","Usually, about 85 percent of what the tabloids report is a lie. Over the last year, I can truly say it has been 99 percent.","Until I separated from Parker, I had never been without them-and it's the hardest thing to share them. But we're trying to give the children the semblance of having whole lives.","Through history, people look for something spiritual. The greatest scientists in the world were men of religion and faith, too.","There's always somebody older, richer, more desperate than you.","The reason I went for Jenny Craig is I thought, Maybe I'm not the only one who has stupid reasons for getting fat.","No matter what parents do, kids retain their uniqueness.","Look for someone who has a complete life without you in it. If you have a person you don't need for anything, that's ideal. You're just together because you really want to be.","It's amazing how coke encompasses everything in your life. Addicts cannot confront life because they only think of their next hit. I ruined life for my parents, my sister and all my friends.","Indians have a big problem with alcohol and drugs. I grew up with an admiration for their culture and was sensitive to their problems.","I was so naive I didn't even know about agents. I telephoned the William Morris agency and asked to speak to Mr. Morris. I expected Bill Morris to be waiting for my call.","I sort of feel sorry for the next man who gets me. I may just kill him with passion. He'd better be strong and have a good heart!","I probably spend more time with my kids than the average stay-at-home mother.","I never did go back to acting class. I was too busy working.","I love marriage. I failed at marriage, but I'd rather go into anything with gusto and fail than go into it half-assed.","I have photographs taken of me at the time I was addicted, and thought I looked good. I see them today and realize my eyes were dead.","I have a hotline to the tabloids. When I get up in the morning, I call the Star, and the last thing at night, I call them. I want them to have the inside track.","I don't think children are any more resilent than anyone else. They're just people with little bodies.","I don't smoke pot. I never liked it.","I don't like psychiatry. I don't believe it works. I believe psychiatrists are neurotic or psychotic, for the most part.","I don't believe you have to have eating disorders and mental illness to screw up.","I developed a nutty attitude where I'd think, If some guy really loves me he doesn't care if I'm fat. I'd come up with all these stupid reasons why it would be OK to be fat.","I couldn't care less about sex unless I meet someone who I think is wonderful.","I believe that behind both the person who weighs 400 pounds and the one who weighs 85 there is a lot of baggage, and it has nothing to do with their bodies.","I am the one who got myself fat, who did all the eating. So I had to take full responsibility for it.","I always had really long swimmer's arms. The last to totally go is always my thighs and butt, but my old body is there somewhere.","I always feel like there is some dude out there with money that I could fall back on if I needed to.","God gave us intestines for a reason. I'm not keen on surgery. It's too extreme. All it took was one of those plastic surgery shows to see how violent it is.","For some reason I am one of those people who act like they were born and raised during the Depression.","I was really tired of words like 'plus size,' 'round' and 'large.' I thought, 'Come on, we're fat.'","When I'm at my best, I'm wearing a 6. When you see yourself pick out the 6... you want to wear the tags on the outside of your clothes.","Scientology helps you lose your insanities. One of the keys is, they say, 'You're in charge of your life, buster. You're responsible for any condition you're in.' If I look at it that way, it helps.","The thing about me is, I don't care what religion you are. If someone is attacking your religion, I will have your back, and I will defend you. I think that is the most repulsive thing a person can do, attack another person's faith.","When you are generalizing, and when your goal is to malign and to say things about an entire group - there are tens of millions of Scientologists in the world - when you decide to blanket statement that 'Scientology is evil,' you are my enemy.","I think that probably all religions sound bizarre to the people who are not the practitioners of them.","My food demons are Chinese food, sugar, butter.","I'm fat! There's nothing else to call it.","If you stop exercising - which I did - and if you stop watching your caloric intake - which I did - you're gonna get fat.","I have to be below 140 to really look good. I have to work my legs like crazy. Actually, do you want my real goal? My real goal's always too low. I love the way I look at, like, 128.","I was born to do sitcoms, where you get an immediate response from the audience.","I want to be a billionaire, and then I want to change something in the world for real."],"Kirsty Coventry":["In athletics, older runners tend to go for longer races, but it's the opposite in swimming because your body can't handle the endurance.","I take any opportunity I can to raise our country's flag really high and get some shining positive light on things over there.","Everyone there including President Mugabe knows something needs to change because so many people are hurting.","People have to remain positive and believe in those dreams. It's really important.","Everyone at home is so supportive. People recognise me, say how proud they are of me. It's awesome to hear, it's amazing to know I can touch so many people in a positive way.","It is much harder to retain your position at the top than to get to the top.","There are younger, stronger swimmers coming up and they are hungry. I can't influence what they do, I only know what I can do and I know how greedy I am to defend my title.","I have always stayed out of politics, I don't believe it would be appropriate to talk about it."],"Kirsty Gallacher":["My idea of a good night has always been having a lovely meal and a proper conversation.","I love spring flowers: daffodils and hyacinths are the ultimate flower for me. They are the essence of spring.","As a working mum, it's really hard to find time in the day to just relax and take a break. I am constantly on the go.","It is still my dream to own a little flower shop.","Being busy with work, and as a mum, I'm a big fan of online shopping.","The idea that so many kids eat rubbish and sit on computers all day long appals me and getting them into sport is a major way of getting them off computers and leading healthier lives.","I am the girliest girl.","I'm a bit of a Luddite and I hate the internet.","Sailing is a completely new sport for me and I wasn't sure what to expect but I've definitely got the bug.","I was quite creative at school, and was also interested in fashion, but I was shy - I'm still not the loudest of people, believe it or not.","I don't find offensive that I'm being labelled a babe by blokes. I'm absolutely flattered.","I grew up Windlesham in Surrey, which is a beautiful and quaint village.","I don't waste money on smart, expensive clothes.","I've got a really sweet tooth and sometimes I just have to have some chocolate.","I love animals and feel very strongly that people should not be allowed to buy a pet if they are not able to look after it.","I have always enjoyed drawing and painting but I don't always find the time to do much these days.","I am not a fan of Facebook or Twitter. They both allow too much information to be available and they make privacy a thing of the past.","I was very sporty at school, and sport was probably the thing I was best at, but my real passion was for fashion.","I also try to eat as much raw food and clean food as possible.","Being a mother is quite tiring. There's not much time to do anything. You just rush around and it's hard work.","I think I think I am Superwoman sometimes but I am not.","I wanted to be a fashion journalist and went to the London College of Fashion to do a journalism and promotion course.","I'm a very private person.","Elizabeth I was my favourite monarch though, what an inspiration, she did great things for women.","I'm not a feminist at all.","I hate alarms. If they go off I get really tetchy. I hate them. They just get me going, I'm hyper at the best of times, but they drive me mad.","Sports broadcasting is very open now. In the beginning you did encounter more traditional attitudes and get comments. But I'm talking about 12 years ago.","I come from a sports family and my husband is a rugby player."],"Kishore Chandra Deo":["Fighting Maoism isn't like fighting an enemy across the border. They are civilians. The military and paramilitary have been trained to fight the enemy, but these are tribals dwelling in forests. They are also our citizens, whom we have ill-treated.","The least we can do is to respect the Constitution because that's the foundation on which our republic is built. If you give the Constitution the go-by, your republic will be under stress.","Air power and military are meant to fight the enemy and not your own citizens... How do you differentiate a Maoist?... It will create a civil war-like situation.","There are several issues why we are opposed to bauxite mining in Visakhapatnam agency region, like environmental pollution, threat to rivers, and tourism."],"Kit Bond":["Similarly, today, we do not know what will happen as we wage the War on Terror. We do know that we can count on the strong support from our closest ally and friend in the world in winning this war to secure our freedoms and the freedoms for all peoples throughout the world.","Our ports are owned by local governments who are responsible for the ports. It is the Coast Guard and Customs that provide security. The federal government will never outsource our security.","Our National Guard, as I think everybody knows, has provided about 40 percent of the boots on the ground in Iraq and in the conflict against Islamofascism. They went into that battle, being called up for their national security service, short of equipment.","We need to end permanently the tax that punishes American values of savings and investment and of building small businesses and family farms and ranches.","Workers come to America to fill jobs unwanted by Americans, but they are staying and they are not going home.","While I support immigration regulated through a legal framework, I do not support rewarding those who broke the law to get here.","Washington should revive international efforts begun during the Clinton administration to pressure countries with dangerously loose banking regulations to adopt and enforce stricter rules.","The U.S. is looking to India as more then just a marketplace for our defense products, but as a technology, aerospace and strategic partner for our future endeavors.","Remember, we know the end of the story of World War II and the Cold War. But day by day, living in fear of the Nazis and then in fear of the Soviets, the outcome was by no means certain.","Reducing the budget for Amtrak makes no sense unless the Administration is prepared to implement a reform strategy which can be supported by the budget request.","One of the most widespread myths about the deal is that the Administration is outsourcing the security of our ports to a company from the United Arab Emirates.","No one who knows my personal situation would think I am not sympathetic to the needs of the active forces.","My son is not wild about going back to Iraq, but he'd sure rather do that than sacrifice all that he and his fellow soldiers have accomplished by leaving too early and inviting chaos.","It is U.S. workers who lose out when employers cannot get the high-tech graduates they need to compete with foreign companies in the 21st century economy.","If we don't act now, the death tax will come back in just a few years. Under current law the death tax is phased out in 2010 but comes back in full force in 2011. That is a ridiculous and untenable policy.","The death tax should be completely and permanently repealed now in order to make the Tax Code fairer and simpler and to eliminate the harmful drag this tax has on the economy.","The death tax punishes the American dream - making it virtually impossible for the average American family to build wealth across generations.","The death tax is one of the leading causes of the dissolution of small businesses.","I pointed out on the floor last year, after Hurricane Katrina, we were very proud that one of our National Guard engineering battalions was called to Louisiana. And they did a magnificent job.","I don't think anyone who has followed the progress of the Islamofascist terrorists who have threatened us believe we are going to be safe if we try a fortress mentality, to step back and say no one is going to hit us, they don't care about the United States. They do.","For this reason, it is essential that our Nation's rural transportation professionals be provided with the necessary tools and support to promote and showcase the value, benefits, and accomplishments of rural transportation planning and development.","For the vast majority of places in America, there is no way you can build a security system such as we have here because of the high priority this rates in terms of terrorist interests.","At a time when the insurgents are saying that time is working against them, my Democratic colleagues are introducing a measure to set a timetable for withdrawal in Iraq that will undercut the momentum that the insurgents themselves say we have built in Iraq.","As we have heard, the end of al-Zarqawi is a significant blow to al-Qaida operations in Iraq. It is another clear indication of the progress we are making.","As the Senator from Vermont was kind enough to note, I did have the experience of being commander in chief of our National Guard in Missouri for 8 years.","America's workers face a battle for their jobs. They are the finest workers in the world. American workers grow, harvest, and mine some of the world's highest quality and most plentiful raw materials.","America demands invention and innovation to succeed.","According to the Small Business Administration, more than 70 percent of all family businesses do not survive through the second generation, and 8 percent do not make it to a third.","A number of the major terrorist captures we have made, the terrorist operations designed for the United States that we have interrupted, were enabled by the terrorist tracking program."],"Kit Carson":["Each of us, having received several hundred dollars, we passed the time gloriously, spending our money freely - never thinking that our lives were risked gaining it.","In camp was found a book, the first of the kind I had ever seen, in which I was made a great hero, slaying Indians by the hundreds."],"Kit Harington":["I'm very lucky, I've got two very loving parents, still very much together, and always been very supportive.","There's an unhealthy obsession in America with royalty and the class system.","My parents didn't have a lot of money when I was growing up. We were comfortable, but I didn't go to Oxbridge, and yet every American interviewer I get says to me, 'You're related to Charles II! Your grandfather was a baronet!' And it's infuriating, because that is a part of my history, but you're trying to turn me into a posh boy, and I'm not.","I have a wild streak, but I like to keep that very much for my friends.","Jeff Bridges is one of those icons that I put on a very high pedestal, so just to get to chill with him off-camera on cold, rainy days was surreal.","I love going out. I love partying.","The best people to have power are the ones who don't want it.","I do want to have children, but my parents had me when they were in their forties. I'd like to copy that.","I actually don't do much to my hair. It gets fussed over a lot on projects because there's a lot of it, and it's boy's hair, but as far as me, I tend to let it do what it wants.","I just don't know anything about fashion.","I try not to read the social networks too much. I find that way madness lies.","I was called Kit from day one; really, I only found out my name was Christopher when I was 11.","My parents brought us up in a very clever way, which was that they saw what we were interested in naturally, and then they encouraged whatever that may be. When I started sharing a keen interest in drama and the theater, instead of steering me away from it, they encouraged me to see plays and think about drama school.","I love New York; I love the city. It's impossible. It's a theme park of a city, isn't it.","I wear quite fitted clothing. I don't like wearing baggy stuff.","There are lots of actors out there who are hugely, hugely talented and haven't got the breaks I've had.","You find with the really great actors, the ones you really admire and look up to, very often they're very giving, generous, warm people.","Politics is a game and a profession. It doesn't really serve the people the politicians are supposed to serve.","There's a huge difference between stage fighting and real sword fighting.","Working with animals is always going to be tough because the animal doesn't know it's an actor.","I trained in theater. And I started in theater with my first two jobs doing stage plays.","When I'm applying for a new passport or something, someone will call me Christopher. Other than that, no one ever calls me Christopher.","I don't go to work thinking, 'Right, I'm going to be more heart-throbby today.'","On a serious level, I wouldn't tell the press if I was in a relationship or not. I wouldn't ever reveal that, because it takes you down a certain road... I have no desire to be courting the press with my love life.","I've always hated my voice. You sound different in your head when you hear it out loud.","I don't do Twitter because I don't want to talk about myself more than I already have to.","I find you can lose yourself in an acting sense in a fight far more easily than you can in a dialogue scene, and I love that about it. We try as actors all the time: we strive just to completely sort of lose ourselves in the moment, and we never quite get there, but in a fight, you can do it in seconds; that is what I love about it.","We are fascinated with our own history, and we are fascinated with the Romans because they were millennia ago, and yet they still capture our imagination because they were actually so similar to us. They were very civilized. They had a very similar political system.","I don't want people thinking they know me instead of the character. Steve McQueen has loads of stories about him - who knows what's true? But it's great for people to fictionalize rather than know the truth.","Any kind of horror video game where I'm the first-person player and I'm... I suddenly stop caring about the video game dude, and I'm like, I really don't want him to die,' and then the minute he dies, it upsets me. I can't play those games.","I love action. I love doing fight scenes; I always have. I love it.","I didn't get into this for fame, I genuinely didn't. I love acting, and I know that's a cliche, but I didn't, really, I was very naive when it came to the whole being recognized thing.","I'm kind of a horse whisperer; I don't know what it is. I'm not great on a horse. I'm getting better, but I'm not brilliant. So yeah, I've spent a lot of time with horses. They're great creatures; I love them. I do love riding them when I get the chance to.","I've always been a bit of a self-doubter. I think a lot of actors are.","As an actor, you don't have much choice about your appearance. It's a good excuse for looking ridiculous.","When I was 14, I saw 'Waiting for Godot.' It's one of those plays that if it's done badly is absolutely dire and can put you off acting for life. But I was laughing all the way through it.","'How to Train Your Dragon,' the first one, was a film I'd seen prior to being approached for the sequel. I don't often watch family animated movies, but it's one that I loved and thought was really well done: beautifully crafted storytelling.","The more you fly, the more unsettling it is, because you realize how much more likely it will be for you to crash. I am getting better at it, though.","I'm a terrible packer. I don't pack lots and lots because I think I'll wear everything, I pack a lot because I never know what I'm going to need. I always go over the weight limit.","I studied history when I was at school, at A-level, actually. I wouldn't profess to being very knowledgeable though, no.","With 'Downton Abbey,' you're always stuck in one stately home.","Wearing baggy clothes makes me look shorter. I just don't know anything about fashion. I know what I like wearing. I'm always accused that I wear too much black. I love wearing black.","I like a girl who does not take me seriously, you know? It's important to be able to laugh at each other.","I remember I had to play a blind person once, and I did this stupid thing with my eyes, and I knew the minute I started it I'd made a mistake."],"Kit Reed":["I should probably confess that I get bored easily, which explains my reluctance to work with formula, tropes, whatever.","I have to believe everything I write is brand new and I'm writing in this way about these people in a completely new situation for the very first time.","I dream in color; it's always a movie and sometimes I'm in it, as myself.","I've lived on a military base and in a convent boarding school with dobermans at the bottom of front stairs to keep us in and intruders out, and in college I spent some time at the Naval Academy, where everything was run by the numbers.","I realized that both the military and religious orders depend on discipline to shape people - which routine does, in a lot of ways."],"Kit Williams":["The dog and the rabbit are telling us not to chase unattainable material goals.","Once upon a perfect night, unclouded and still, there came the face of a pale and beautiful lady. The tresses of her hair reached out to make the constellations, and the dewy vapours of her gown fell soft upon the land.","The hoop is there to remind us not to jump through it, not to submit to someone else's control.","Having designed and built several clocks during my career it suddenly occurred to me that when you look at the face of a clock both hands have the same center.","The chariot was purchased by a private collector who took it home to New York. I take pleasure in knowing that it was built to last for at least a thousand years.","She's not happy about the life she is living but to jump through the hoop would mean to succumb to death.","Newton, of course, was the inventor of differential calculus so his place in the tale is quite special.","He was so tenacious he defied the distraction of women by refusing to have them in his presence, just as later in life he denied his blindness by calling for more and more candles.","The rabbit is significant in that the handle on the original South Pointing Chariot was carved in the form of a rabbit. Because the handle extended out front it meant that wherever the rabbit went the chariot had to follow.","If we listen human instinct actually tells us what we need, but advertising makes us want things we don't need and things we can't have.","The engine of ancient society was religion but the engine of contemporary society, as I see it, is advertising.","If you look closely you can see that they are all interconnected, symbolic of a never-ending circle in which it is simply impossible for the dog to catch the rabbit.","The dog, the rabbit and the hoop all feature in the painting, and take the place of the orrery.","Today she is the lady of death, which I believe is the best muse to have.","In the fairy tale the painting represents the here and now. The book is actually divided into five sections, through which the key character, the muse, leads us.","As I was working I noticed that the way I designed the differential gearing actually created a spare drive that sat directly below the emperor's feet, or where they would be if he were to sit in the chariot.","You see, my ambition was not to confound the engineering world but simply to create a beautiful piece of art.","I took lots of photographs and had planned to write a treatise on how it worked, but I quickly got bored with that idea and wrote a scientific fairy tale instead.","I think most artists find it difficult to part with their work but it's the parting that keeps us alive and keeps us working. In the case of the chariot, although it's been sold I actually still have it, just in another form.","I made every single piece myself, each individual component, so it was quite time consuming.","I started by looking at what others had done before me. You see, over the years there have been attempts by many different people to reconstruct the chariot.","In practical terms the South Pointing Chariot was a simple direction finder. It could have been made to point in any direction - north, south, east or west.","The original item looked like a little hand cart with the figure of a man mounted on a platform between the wheels. The man's outstretched arm always pointed south."],"Kitty Carlisle":["I was born in New Orleans, and I wasn't allowed to go to the movies.","It was considered oh, not proper for children to go to the movies.","I was taken to concerts when I was six, seven years old, and sat in a box throughout the whole evening.","I was near sighted. I was born myopic, and I got glasses, right after that.","The next thing that happened to me was that I, we, were living in Paris where I then grew up.","So in those days, they were scooping up any young person who could sing and look decent, ah, at the same time.","So I got caught up in the same wave as everybody else and went right out to Hollywood, to make movies.","And I wasn't crazy about Hollywood in those days.","My mother thought Hollywood was a den of iniquity, and people came to terrible bad ends there.","It never occurred to me that I looked like a movie star.","And I didn't, that's why my career was very short lived.","I get on the floor, and I can do things a woman a fifth my age can't do."],"Kitty Kelley":["Most historians agree that Abraham Lincoln was the most important man to ever occupy the White House because he abolished slavery and kept the states united through a bloody civil war.","Once I decide to do something, I can't have people telling me I can't. If there's a roadblock, you jump over it, walk around it, crawl under it.","Kennedy was haunted by the Bay of Pigs invasion but carried the country through the Cuban Missile Crisis. He later increased the number of U.S. military advisers to South Vietnam to more than 16,000.","People forget that unauthorized does not mean untrue and authorized does not mean authentic.","I am what is known as a benched Catholic and disillusioned by the church doctrine. I believe in things the Catholic Church does not believe in: divorce being one, and a women's right to choose being another.","He ordered killings as easily as he ordered linguine.","I was raised Irish Catholic and went to Holy Names Academy, an all-girl's private Catholic school. I loved the nuns there and I love them to this day.","While many applauded Oprah for opening her heart to young girls in South Africa, some criticized her for not investing in the youth of America.","A hero is someone we can admire without apology.","Gay marriage has jumped out of the closet on to the front page. Everyone from the president of the U.S. to retired four-star general Colin Powell is embracing the issue, now supported by most Americans. Still, a few people, like former First Lady Laura Bush appear to be conflicted.","Presidents often disappoint, but first ladies rarely do.","When Caroline Kennedy endorsed Barack Obama in 2008 as her father's rightful heir, she laid upon him the mantle of Camelot and the enduring mystique of John F. Kennedy, who, according to polls, continues to be America's most beloved president.","Both Kennedy and Obama exuded a dash of glamour in their roles as commander-in-chief and became the darlings of Hollywood. As president, each brought to the White House a fashionable and accomplished First Lady, two adorable young children and scene-stealing pets.","Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to ensure fair pay for women in the workplace. In addition, he succeeded in getting a measure passed to end discrimination against gays in the military.","John F. Kennedy brought style and charisma to the White House and a first family that captivated the country: a handsome, witty president, an elegant first lady, and two adorable young children.","The rumors of Frank Sinatra's violence and his ties to organized crime were such that journalists joked in print about me ending up in concrete boots and sleeping with the fishes if I proceeded to write his biography.","My biography of Frank Sinatra is not paean to his music but rather an illumination of the man behind the music, who once described himself as 'an 18-karat manic-depressive who lived a life of violent emotional contradictions with an over-acute capacity for sadness as well as happiness.'","I can't say I wasn't warned. Alarms started clanging the day I signed to write 'His Way: The Unauthorized Biography of Frank Sinatra' (Bantam Books, 1986).","The difference between authorized and unauthorized biographies is the difference between riding in carriage or squatting in steerage.","The authorized biographers - the ones hand-picked to write the sanitized version of a subject's life - sit up front with the swells while the unauthorized biographer who writes without access or approval gets elbowed to the back of the bus.","I'm not surprised, but I am disappointed that Katharine Carr Esters claims that she was 'tricked' into divulging her true feelings about Oprah and that she now denies that she revealed to me the identity of Oprah's biological father.","I admired Eugene McCarthy's courage and although I left his Senate staff after four years to accept a job as the researcher on the editorial page of the 'Washington Post,' I remained an admirer.","Shortly after Senator Eugene J. McCarthy died in 2005 the age of 89, I became an honorary member of the committee starting a fellowship in McCarthy's name at his alma mater, Saint John's University in Collegeville, Minnesota.","I would love to do an unauthorized biography about Congress... It's like a secret society up there.","I don't give you editorial control. I want to meet you. I want to interview everybody who's ever known you. I want to see your correspondence. I want to see your bank statements. But you will have no control over what I write. That's why I really believe in the unauthorized biography.","Barack Obama and Michelle Obama don't go to Georgetown... The Clintons did, indeed. And the Clintons go out and about in Washington now. They go to neighborhood restaurants.","Studies have been done showing that there really are gender differences, that women do bring more congeniality and compromise to the table.","There's still time for redemption if I live long enough, don't you think?","I have believed in the biographies I have written. I truly can tell you that they have influenced our society politically, culturally, socially.","JFK used to say the bishops and the cardinals were all Republicans, but the nuns were Democrats! I sort of believe that too.","I tend to place my own value in spirituality rather than religiosity."],"Kjell Magne Bondevik":["Unfortunately, religion, like patriotism, is easy to misuse for political purposes.","We have a good life when we manage to live with both satisfied and unsatisfied needs, when we are not obsessed by what is beyond our reach.","Terrorism is contempt for human dignity.","Human dignity is independent of national borders. We must always defend the interests of the poor and the persecuted in other countries.","We must never relinquish the vision of a humane society and a humane world.","Knowledge of other people's beliefs and ways of thinking must be used to build bridges, not to create conflicts.","Don't believe those who claim that only left wing parties really care about employment.","Villa Grande has in many ways symbolized an important, but less than pleasant, part of our history.","We have to find compromises. That's the way it is in Norway.","A person's worth is quite independent of their usefulness to society.","Each individual is unique. We all have equal worth. Young and old, those who can cope and those who need help.","Extremists and populist movements are exploiting people's fear of those who are not like us. We can see the consequences in the form of terrorism and racially motivated violence.","If each of us is to feel that he or she is valued, this calls for more than public funding.","If we dare to come closer to our fellow human beings, we will be able to see and understand them better.","We must remember that politics is more than a power game. The core of politics in my view is to serve our citizens, to serve our fellow human beings.","The burden of proof is now on the Palestinians... They must fight terrorism and dismantle its infrastructures in order to make possible progress on the roadmap.","There is a need for more effective dialogue... between the government and the international community."],"Klas Pontus Arnoldson":["Without peace, there is nothing truly human. Peace is harmony. And harmony is the highest ideal of life.","Without peace, there is no freedom, individual or national. War and hostilities are a form of slavery.","Man's nature is fundamentally good, or perhaps it is neither good nor evil. In any case, man is something to work on. We must hold fast to this fact - man is something to work on."],"Klaus Fuchs":["The Communist Party said that I must finish my studies because after the revolution in Germany people would be required with technical knowledge to take part in the building of the Communist Germany.","I joined the Communist Party because I felt I had to be in some organization.","I think the one thing that most stands out is that my father always did what he believed to be the right thing to do and he always told us that we had to go our own way even if he disagreed.","At this time I had complete confidence in Russian policy and believed that the Western Allies deliberately allowed Germany and Russia to fight each other to death.","I was a student in Germany when Hitler came to power.","I was ready to accept the philosophy that the Party is right and that in the coming struggle you could not permit yourself any doubts after the party had made a decision.","Shortly afterwards my father told me that he might be going into the Eastern Zone of Germany. At that time my own mind was closer to his than it had ever been before, because he also believed that they are at least trying to build a new world.","The last time when I handed over information was in February or March 1949.","There is nobody I know by name who is concerned with collecting information for the Russian authorities. There are people whom I know by sight whom I trusted with my life.","Before I joined the project most of the English people with whom I had made personal contacts were left wing and affected to some degree or other by the same kind of philosophy.","At that time I had complete confidence in Russian policy and I believed that the Western Allies deliberately allowed Russia and Germany to fight each other to the death.","Finally Germany's attack on Russia seemed to confirm that Russia was not shirking and was prepared to carry out a foreign policy with the risk of war with Germany.","I had therefore, no hesitation in giving all the information I had, even though occasionally I tried to concentrate mainly on giving information about the results of my own work.","I was in the underground until I left Germany.","I was lucky because on the morning after the burning of the Reichstag I left my home very early to catch a train to Berlin for the conference of our student organization and that is the only reason why I escaped arrest.","In the post war period I began again to have my doubts about Russian policy.","Since coming to Harwell I have met English people of all kinds, and I have come to see in many of them a deep rooted firmness which enables them to lead a decent way of life.","Since that time I have had continuous contact with the persons who were completely unknown to me, except that I knew they would hand whatever information I gave them to the Russian authorities."],"Klaus Kinski":["I am your fairy tale. Your dream. Your wishes and desires, and I am your thirst and your hunger and your food and your drink.","Put a bird cage near the window so that the bird can see the sky? It's much better to look than not to, even if it hurts.","But words - words are not enough!","People who do not see the terrible things therefore do not see the beautiful things, either.","I sell myself for the highest price. Exactly like a prostitute. There is no difference.","Sometimes my heart hurts so much, I beat it with my fists. I try to run. But you cannot run from this. It waits for you. Even when you think you have escaped it, it is there.","One should judge a man mainly from his depravities. Virtues can be faked. Depravities are real.","When you are there, you are. With words, you aren't.","I make movies for money, exclusively for money.","About 25 years ago, I was in an apartment, and next door, they put on the radio, so I struck the wall with my fist, but they did not put the radio down. I took a tool and banged until I made a hole through the wall. It was like a comedy movie.","Fun? There is no fun.","I am dying of hunger.","I am not the Jesus of the official church tolerated by those in power. I am not your superstar.","I could be with a woman in a bed, for weeks even, and it would seem to me like three seconds. Or 300 years.","I didn't choose solitude.","I don't need anybody to tell me how to be alive.","I have to shoot without any breaks. I yell at Herzog and hit him. I have to fight for every sequence. I wish Herzog would catch the plague, more than ever.","I knew there were, in myself, the souls of millions of people who lived centuries ago; not just people but animals, plants, the elements, things, even, matter. All of these exist in me.","In a way, everything concerning a movie leaves me cold.","It is the Nobel Prize I want. It's worth $400,000.","It is true what Rimbaud said; If you think a book is strong enough, try it at the ocean, in the wind, at the waves. If the book can resist the ocean, then it exists. Otherwise, throw it away.","Once, I took a taxi. I hate those limousines. They stink and their drivers have been driving dead people to the cemeteries.","The dimensions of my feelings are too violent.","The truth is, I can never die.

I am your reaction in the water of a mountain lake.","The ultimate acting is to destroy yourself.","What do you think, that a dollar in a savings account is freedom? Maybe you have understood nothing I have said.","Whenever I was with a woman, I always sort of want another one. So there was always another one.

You cannot treat it badly; you have to keep it, make as sensitive as possible.","You leap over the wall of one ghetto and find yourself in another ghetto."],"Klaus Lackner":["My personal view is the true long-term storage is mineral carbonates, which is some form of accelerated weathering.","I believe that it is impossible to stop people from using the fossil fuels, so we need to develop technologies which allow us to use them without creating environmental havoc on the planet.","Technologies simmer along before they are feasible. That simmer can be short or long, but then they get traction. And from there to being huge is a couple of decades.","I don't think you have a choice but to pull CO2 back that has already made it out, or is about to make it out, because we are not overnight shutting down all the coal plants.","A car produces about one pound of CO2 per mile. There is no problem with collecting the CO2 in the tailpipe, but one might easily end up with a trailer hitched to the car for carrying all this CO2 back to the filling station. The gas burned from a 15-gallon tank would fill up five 60-inch-tall gas bottles.","It is important that carbon storage is carefully regulated, that the process is transparent to the public, and that there is a clear accounting of what happened to the CO2. This is particularly true of underground storage, where there is always a small chance that pressurized CO2 could escape.","In a well-monitored storage site, it is always possible to release CO2 in a controlled manner in the unlikely event that it threatens to escape. Such a release is certainly no worse than ignoring the emission in the first place.","Injecting CO2 into an underground reservoir would certainly change the local environment and thus affect the organisms that live there. Some will thrive, and others will suffer. While we should minimize such impacts, they cannot be avoided completely. The same happens when one plows a field, builds a house or a road, or waters a lawn.","Either you abandon fossil fuels, or you find a way to get that carbon back.","There's an overemphasis on conservation and other idyllic energy sources that can be harmful in that it hampers new technology and innovation.","The fact that companies are getting into building power plants that collect their own CO2 on-site shows there's some leadership in that industry. Some industries have seen the writing on the wall: that carbon will have to be managed.","We need to figure out a way to create more energy on a gigawatt scale and not create so much CO2 in the process.","The idea that somewhere in the desert far away you have a CO2 absorber that's removing the CO2 from the air is an attractive one. It's a costly process that many will say is too expensive, but so are fuel cells in cars. It's a matter of political will to move this forward.","If we want to stabilize the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere at some level - it really doesn't matter which level - you end up having to stop emissions virtually completely.","If carbon came out of the ground, it has to go back into the ground.","Fossil fuels will run out not because of limited resources but because of the environmental impact. If I can solve that impact, I have basically increased the resource base by a vast amount."],"Klaus Schulze":["The human voice is the first and most natural musical instrument, also the most emotional.","Everything changes permantly. How boring if it wouldn't.","I listened to the rock music of that time, but as you know and can easily hear: my music of that era had nothing to do with the common music of this era. I was experimenting, I was searching for something new.","Yes, I'm a musician. I also like to play with others, sometimes more, sometimes less.","Manuel is still today a good friend. The others I see rarely, but with Edgar I phone from time to time.","Yes, I was invited to make the sound environment at a booth of a huge electronic company, during the Hanover Industrial Fair in 1973. It was a job. Slightly good paid. But not as much as my producer then told the press.","I did not start IC and Inteam to have control over my music. I had control before and after.","I never had many problems to do my music and to give it to a record company. Rarely do they try to argue with me about my music, probably because it's still too far-out.","The problem was the journalists who also did not understand much of my music, but they wrote about it. I think you fell into the usual trap laid out by parts of the press and other writers: that the poor musician has always to fight the evil companies and managers.","Because, also the world of showbiz is not just black and white, good and bad.","As everyone else, I was a fan of Pink Floyd in the sixties.","My interest in his new toy, the Theremin, isn't very big. It simply does not fit into my way of playing music. I do not want to fiddle around with my hands in the air.","I had to realize that the use of samples has its rules, too.","Yes, sampling has changed not just my way of playing and composing.","How did this or that change my music? The only time I have to think about it is when an interviewer asks me that.","As always in a musical collaboration: One has to like each other. As simple as that.","We are all part of a tradition, at least we depend on the past.","A concert is a concert is a concert is a concert. An album is an album is an album is an album. Musically, both have nothing in common.","Every music - except dance music, which is for dancing, I suppose - is for the spirit of the human being, and not for the body.","Sometimes I like to make music together with a singer or with singers.","And of course, the musician - if he's serious - always answers: My last album is my best, otherwise I wouldn't have done it.","Then, in 1983 I went on a very long concert tour all over Europe.","When I came back I had to realize that IC was not in a very good shape - all the much money that we had because of the huge Ideal success, was gone. I was very upset.","Most of today's music is done electronically."],"Klaus Schwab":["Change can be frightening, and the temptation is often to resist it. But change almost always provides opportunities - to learn new things, to rethink tired processes, and to improve the way we work.","Corporate social responsibility is measured in terms of businesses improving conditions for their employees, shareholders, communities, and environment. But moral responsibility goes further, reflecting the need for corporations to address fundamental ethical issues such as inclusion, dignity, and equality.","The trends that are shaping the twenty-first-century world embody both promise and peril. Globalization, for example, has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty while contributing to social fragmentation and a massive increase in inequality, not to mention serious environmental damage.","The concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) has long been used as an effective lens through which to examine the actions business can take toward ensuring mutual long-term well-being and sustainability.","The First Industrial Revolution used water and steam power to mechanize production. The Second used electric power to create mass production. The Third used electronics and information technology to automate production.","The Fourth Industrial Revolution can compromise humanity's traditional sources of meaning - work, community, family, and identity - or it can lift humanity into a new collective and moral consciousness based on a sense of shared destiny. The choice is ours.","Business cycles naturally entail peaks and troughs in employment, and socially responsible businesses should follow successful examples like Coca-Cola, Alcoa, Saudi Aramco, Africa Rainbow Minerals, and Google in working toward mitigating joblessness and enhancing people's abilities to earn a livelihood.","Profitability, growth, and safeguards against existential risks are crucial to strengthening a company's long-term prospects. But if these three factors constitute a company's 'hard power,' firms also need 'soft power': public trust and acceptance, won by fulfilling a company's social responsibility.","Environmental pollution, terrorism, and many other global threats do not stop at borders. We all bear global responsibility and thus need a global identity to enable us to cope with them. We must learn to integrate different levels of identity in ourselves. What matters is not either/or, but both/and.","Of course, technology is not an exogenous force over which humans have no control. We are not constrained by a binary choice between acceptance and rejection. Rather, the decisions we make every day as citizens, consumers, and investors guide technological progress.","I am a great enthusiast and early adopter of technology, but sometimes I wonder whether the inexorable integration of technology in our lives could diminish some of our quintessential human capacities, such as compassion and cooperation.","I believe that, if managed well, the Fourth Industrial Revolution can bring a new cultural renaissance, which will make us feel part of something much larger than ourselves: a true global civilization. I believe the changes that will sweep through society can provide a more inclusive, sustainable and harmonious society. But it will not come easily.","Technology is going to revolutionize almost every sector, leading to the demise of many traditional professions. Economic and political power will be determined less by a country's size than by its technological superiority.","As the physical, digital, and biological worlds continue to converge, new technologies and platforms will increasingly enable citizens to engage with governments, voice their opinions, coordinate their efforts, and even circumvent the supervision of public authorities.","New technologies and approaches are merging the physical, digital, and biological worlds in ways that will fundamentally transform humankind. The extent to which that transformation is positive will depend on how we navigate the risks and opportunities that arise along the way.","The Fourth Industrial Revolution has the potential to empower individuals and communities, as it creates new opportunities for economic, social, and personal development. But it also could lead to the marginalization of some groups, exacerbate inequality, create new security risks, and undermine human relationships.","The Millennials, a generation born digital, will have a much stronger impact on social behaviour than we currently assume. Global climate change and resource security will influence our lives in substantial ways.","One new reality is global interconnectivity and the fact that all challenges must be addressed on the basis of 'togetherness.' Thus the most crucial factor in accepting the new reality and confronting its opportunities and risks is our willingness to develop shared norms on all levels.","It was a hallmark of Nelson Mandela's leadership that being open to change made him appear not weaker, but even stronger.","New technologies, however remarkable they might seem, are fundamentally just tools made by people for people.","In Switzerland, we have a centuries-old tradition of living together in one confederation and one society. That holds us back from excesses. We are a civilized and enlightened community and, by practising multicultural tolerance, we manage to stop extreme developments from going too far.","Of all the many leaders I have met in the course of my life, none made a deeper impression on me than Nelson Mandela. His courage, compassion, humility and wisdom were without parallel on the world stage, and he himself was an enduring source of inspiration.","We must address, individually and collectively, moral and ethical issues raised by cutting-edge research in artificial intelligence and biotechnology, which will enable significant life extension, designer babies, and memory extraction.","As technology increasingly takes over knowledge-based work, the cognitive skills that are central to today's education systems will remain important; but behavioral and non-cognitive skills necessary for collaboration, innovation, and problem solving will become essential as well.","Technological change is never an isolated phenomenon. This revolution takes place inside a complex ecosystem which comprises business, governmental and societal dimensions. To make a country fit for the new type of innovation-driven competition, the whole ecosystem has to be considered.","We often hear people talk about the concept of 'uberization,' where a new technology completely turns an industry on its head and forces us to rethink the way things have always been done. No industry will remain untouched by these forces.","Nelson Mandela understood that social transformation and economic transformation go hand in hand.","For all the opportunities that arise from the Fourth Industrial Revolution - and there are many - it does not come without risks. Perhaps one of the greatest is that the changes will exacerbate inequalities. And as we all know, a more unequal world is a less stable one.","As the novelty of wearable tech gives way to necessity - and, later, as wearable tech becomes embedded tech - will we be deprived of the chance to pause, reflect, and engage in meaningful, substantive conversations? How will our inner lives and ties to those around us change?","A winner-takes-all economy that offers only limited access to the middle class is a recipe for democratic malaise and dereliction.","Receiving an economic boost from the digital era is not a luxury - it is essential to ensuring that Europe continues to grow and deliver levels of prosperity that meet the rising expectations of its citizens.","I do not deny my German identity. But I also feel Swiss. Of my eight great-grandparents, seven were born Swiss. I have been living in Switzerland for more than 50 years.","I am an enthusiastic European, and my first-hand experience of war and hatred has strengthened that conviction. I have seen how misguided unilateral nationalistic identities have brought destruction and death. I am, however, a world citizen, too.","For centuries, economic thinkers, from Adam Smith to John Maynard Keynes, have tried to identify the elusive formula that makes some countries more prosperous and successful than others. My curiosity about this topic spurred me, as a young professor of economics in the late 1970s, to research new ways of measuring national competitiveness.","When the World Economic Forum was established in 1971, the global population was four billion, of which 50% lived in poverty.","I like, very much, nature. Since I'm always together with people, I like to retreat.","Of course, some people call me one of the most well-networked people in the world, but I am a very unsocial person - I never go to a cocktail party; I am never seen at a charity event. I have one exception: I'm a member of the board for one of the big European music festivals, so I participate, with pleasure, in concerts.","Europe has grown to 27 member states, encompassing an amazing diversity and richness. Some argue this is part of the problem: Europe is simply too big and culturally disparate to be managed properly. But look to India for an example of how social unity can be forged within a culturally, linguistically, and ethnically complex nation.","Diversity does not preclude political stability.","Talent is a by-product of education; the quality of a country's human capital depends on it.","Sometimes, if a country's currency is overvalued in real terms, and it looks like the current account is going to be in deficit for the foreseeable future, devaluation can make sense.","An overwhelming number of economists, international civil servants, and policy-makers argue that a fragmentation of the Eurozone would cause a new depression and massive wealth destruction around the world. It would also end the period of economic integration that has characterized world politics since the end of the Cold War.","For many years prior to the 1990s, European integration was embraced and supported by a large majority of citizens. A united Europe, bound by commonly-held democratic values, was perceived as an essential and effective buffer against the Soviet empire. A united Europe made a repeat of the First and Second World Wars almost unthinkable.","Europe has never had a single or unified voice in world affairs: a common foreign policy. It has often appeared to be rudderless and unable to make quick decisions when faced with economic crises, presenting instead an image of division and hopelessness.","When you can't cope with change, you feel overwhelmed, and you look for a simple solution.","We are now living in a completely digitalized world and a completely globalized world, so we have to find some new mechanisms and values to deal with this post-digitalized and post-globalized world."],"Klaus von Klitzing":["I am happy that I have so many friends all over the world who contributed to my research work, and I believe that also in the future, basic research offers the best opportunity of reaching across borders and overcoming ideological barriers.","The publicity of the Nobel Prize has made clear that the research work connected with the Quantum Hall Effect was so successful because a tremendous large number of institutions and individuals supported this activity.","I believe that every Nobel Laureate has the feeling that this prize is really a gift - because nobody can or should work just for this prize.","The Nobel prize is unquestionably the most famous prize in the world, and very often, the prize is an object of prestige not only for a person but also for a research center, a country, or for a particular area of interest.","I am certain that our Max Planck Institute in Stuttgart will increasingly be an international meeting place open to scientists of all countries.","Semiconductor research and the Nobel Prize in physics seem to be contradictory since one may come to the conclusion that such a complicated system like a semiconductor is not useful for very fundamental discoveries.","The discovery of the Quantized Hall Effect (QHE) was the result of systematic measurements on silicon field effect transistors - the most important device in microelectronics.","I've always wanted to answer all the questions that nature posed for us."],"Klay Thompson":["I know to win a championship, you're not going to do it alone.

No. Am I as fast as I used to be? No, but I still have the fundamentals and smarts. That's what enables me to still be a dominant player. As a kid growing up, I never skipped steps. I always worked on fundamentals because I know athleticism is fleeting.","I like playing for the purple and gold. This is where I want to finish up.","I don't think a coach becomes the right coach until he wins a championship.","The only thing I'm afraid of is bees. I don't like bees. I'm allergic to them.","It's hard for me to grasp the concept of somebody being nervous when I'm talking to them.","It's different from being 21 and you think there's endless amount of opportunities. At 33, the ending is much, much closer.","I don't want to be the next Michael Jordan, I only want to be Kobe Bryant.","People just don't understand how obsessed I am with winning.","The topic of leadership is a touchy one. A lot of leaders fail because they don't have the bravery to touch that nerve or strike that chord. Throughout my years, I haven't had that fear.","The people who truly know me know what I'm like. There have been people who try to say things that aren't fair, and I check them. And then they don't like me because I checked them.","What people see on court is another side of me; it's not me.","The Black Mamba collection of watches is me: It is my alter ego, so to speak. As I mentioned before, it is sharp, cutting edge and sleek which are characteristics I try to apply when I'm out there on the basketball court.","I'm extremely willful to win, and I respond to challenges. Scoring titles and stuff like that... it sounds, well, I don't care how it sounds - to me, scoring comes easy. It's not a challenge to me to win the scoring title, because I know I can.","Magic has five championships. I have five championships. I'm pretty sure we both know what we're doing.","I've got four dogs, and I just don't do dog doo. I'm a diva when it comes to that.","In an individual sport, yes, you have to win titles. Baseball's different. But basketball, hockey? One person can control the tempo of a game, can completely alter the momentum of a series. There's a lot of great individual talent.","I love going one-on-one with someone. That's what I do. I've never lost. It's a whole different game, just to have them right in front of you and be able to do whatever you want.","It's disgusting, but my father taught me when your mouth gets dry, just suck the sweat out of your own jersey. There's no bravado to any of it; it's just a disgusting little trick.","At the end of 2003, my game was complete. Shooting, defense, using the dribble, transition, midrange stuff was all there. Then it was about fine-tuning and trying to improve in each area.","It never bothered me when people would say, 'You only win championships because you're playing with Shaq.' It bothered me when he said it.","I'm more than comfortable just sitting back and scoring 21, 22 points or whatever and getting 10, 11 assists whatever the case might be. More than comfortable with that. It's just a matter of the pieces that you have around you and what you can do to elevate everybody else.","If there were camera phones back in the day, the biggest athletes in the world would have had a lot of explaining to do.","Eeew, I'd be a little uncomfortable Googling myself. People sit there - and Google themselves? That's kind of weird.","There's been a lot of talk of me being a one-man show but that's simply not the case. We win games when I score 40 points and we've won when I score 10.","We all know what flopping is when we see it. The stuff that you see is where guys aren't really getting hit at all and are just flailing around like a fish out of water.","You want me to own a team and deal with these rich, spoiled stubborn athletes, and try to get them to perform? No thank you.","Christmas morning, I'm going to open presents with my kids. I'm going to take pictures of them opening the presents. Then I'm going to come to the Staples Center and get ready to work.","I'm not the most patient of people.","If I panic, everyone else panics.","Twitter is great to connect with fans and be transparent. I enjoy that aspect about it. But really, I'm still trying to figure it out.","Dropkick Murphys get me going, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Nirvana... plus, all the regular hip-hop stuff.","Pooper scooper? Yeah, I've done it a few times. Every once in a while, you have to."],"Kodi Smit-McPhee":["New Orleans is awake all night, and every night is a party.","I'm always working with amazing people. They're just kind of put in my path.","It's kind of a Peter Pan thing: I want to stay a kid. I love it. But I guess you have to grow up someday. Everybody does.","'Slow West' is a film that I did with Michael Fassbender in New Zealand and Scotland. The director was John McLean. It's a film set in the 1800s. I play a young Scottish boy brought up in the royal family. I fall in love with someone who works on our land.","When I know I'm not doing any auditions, I go to the skate park on my scooter or my bike.","I really like driving cars. I love car games.","I think indie films have more of a fresh, experimental vibe about them, whereas studio films know what they want and can basically get it.","My friends in Australia, they grew up with me acting, so they're used to it.","I thought that 'Twilight' would be a kind of girl movie, but it was cool.","In L.A., I live right across from Universal Studios.","Vampires used to be like Dracula, and now they're young teenage kids, so yeah, I like that.","I've got to write about my character every day. I've got to find out where he lives, what bus he catches to school, and stuff like that. You've got to know every little thing about him so when you do it, it feels natural.","Interviews are fun, but I get nervous at red carpets.","I like animation: you can go to work in your pyjamas.","My favorite genre is comedy.","I've been joking that 'On the Road' is the prequel to 'The Road.' I don't know if that's a very good joke.","I think I've been good at getting into lonely and troubled characters because, not to brag, but I'm the complete opposite in real life.","My dad teaches me. He teaches me everything. He's been acting for over 30 years, so he knows a lot.","I'm based in L.A., mainly. I'm pretty much there a lot of the time doing work.","In Australia, I can just say to my mom, 'I'm going down the street.' And I can walk around pretty much all the places I know.","I'm geeky about video games. I don't stay inside a lot and just play them 24/7, but if I had the chance, I probably would.","When I was 8, my dad asked me if I wanted to audition, just for fun. I did just a little short film, and I liked it. I just kept doing it, and then I started getting bigger auditions for bigger roles.","I haven't done a lot of studio movies, but studio movies and independent films are always just as fun as each other.","I think 'Paranorman' was a great adventure.","You shouldn't fight change. You should be absolutely open to change.","I think when you have to train an accent, it just takes you absolutely into another spectrum of the character.","The most important thing I have learned from the people I've worked with is that you have to love what you do. That passion will drive you anywhere you want to go.","I'm not really sure if I have anything that inspires me.","'The Road' was my first American film, my first film in the snow. The first of everything. So, I was jumping into it, and that was pretty grueling.","Actors shouldn't be scared. Don't get scared on film.","My dad reads the scripts and passes them on to me.","I'd really like to work with Johnny Depp: he seems like a really cool guy; he can do a lot of different things.","Usually, I think, every film I've made has been a book, and I've always read it.","I haven't seen 'The Exorcist,' but I've seen a lot of pictures of the girl in it. So now I don't actually want to see it. She scares me so much. I don't know what it is, but even though it's quite old now, it still has the best and scariest make-up I've ever seen in my life.","I like everything from hard-style techno to rock n' roll.","My sister's an actor as well.","If I could choose any car in the world, I'd get a Lamborghini, but I think that's a bit too much money. I'll start off with maybe a V8 or something.","I wouldn't mind doing my own film on the big screen. That'd be cool.","I think, obviously, everyone has a lot of favorite movies, but I really for some reason just love Quentin Tarantino's writing and directing style.","I think I would play Batman. I love Batman.","I think everyone has been different once in their life.","I wasn't bullied or anything, but I was treated differently because I was an actor, and I had big dreams.","I think I'm the best fit for characters that have a lot going on inside.","I don't really like simple characters too much; it's too easy. I like a challenge, and I like characters you connect with on screen."],"Kofi Annan":["Knowledge is power. Information is liberating. Education is the premise of progress, in every society, in every family.","Gender equality is more than a goal in itself. It is a precondition for meeting the challenge of reducing poverty, promoting sustainable development and building good governance.","More than ever before in human history, we share a common destiny. We can master it only if we face it together. And that, my friends, is why we have the United Nations.","It has been said that arguing against globalization is like arguing against the laws of gravity.","Education is a human right with immense power to transform. On its foundation rest the cornerstones of freedom, democracy and sustainable human development.","In their greatest hour of need, the world failed the people of Rwanda.","To live is to choose. But to choose well, you must know who you are and what you stand for, where you want to go and why you want to get there.","Unfortunately, very few governments think about youth unemployment when they are drawing up their national plans.","We must ensure that the global market is embedded in broadly shared values and practices that reflect global social needs, and that all the world's people share the benefits of globalization.","The United Nations, whose membership comprises almost all the states in the world, is founded on the principle of the equal worth of every human being.","If we can come up with innovations and train young people to take on new jobs, and if we can switch to clean energy, I think we have the capacity to build this world not dependent on fossil-fuel. I think it will happen, and it won't destroy economy.","In the rush for justice it is important not to lose sight of principles the country holds dear.","In the 21st century, I believe the mission of the United Nations will be defined by a new, more profound awareness of the sanctity and dignity of every human life, regardless of race or religion.","We cannot wait for governments to do it all. Globalization operates on Internet time. Governments tend to be slow moving by nature, because they have to build political support for every step.","Business, labor and civil society organizations have skills and resources that are vital in helping to build a more robust global community.","If the United Nations does not attempt to chart a course for the world's people in the first decades of the new millennium, who will?","On climate change, we often don't fully appreciate that it is a problem. We think it is a problem waiting to happen.","When economic conditions are difficult, people tend to be less generous and protect themselves; the question of solidarity doesn't mean much to them at that time.","We need to keep hope alive and strive to do better.","There is no development strategy more beneficial to society as a whole - women and men alike - than the one which involves women as central players.","We need to think of the future and the planet we are going to leave to our children and their children.","What governments and people don't realise is that sometimes the collective interest - the international interest - is also the national interest.","I don't share the view that the ICC is anti-African. The ICC is not putting Africa on trial. The ICC is fighting impunity and individuals who are accused of crimes.","We have the means and the capacity to deal with our problems, if only we can find the political will.","Open markets offer the only realistic hope of pulling billions of people in developing countries out of abject poverty, while sustaining prosperity in the industrialized world.","If one is going to err, one should err on the side of liberty and freedom.","I urge the Iraqi leadership for sake of its own people... to seize this opportunity and thereby begin to end the isolation and suffering of the Iraqi people.","I have always believed that on important issues, the leaders must lead. Where the leaders fail to lead, and people are really concerned about it, the people will take the lead and make the leaders follow.","We have to choose between a global market driven only by calculations of short-term profit, and one which has a human face.","National markets are held together by shared values and confidence in certain minimum standards. But in the new global market, people do not yet have that confidence.","Many African leaders refuse to send their troops on peace keeping missions abroad because they probably need their armies to intimidate their own populations.","More countries have understood that women's equality is a prerequisite for development.","The Lord had the wonderful advantage of being able to work alone.","Above all else, we need a reaffirmation of political commitment at the highest levels to reducing the dangers that arise both from existing nuclear weapons and from further proliferation.","Iraq has a new opportunity to comply with all these relevant resolutions of the Security Council.","The question is the morning after. What sort of Iraq do we wake up to after the bombing? What happens in the region? What impact could it have? These are questions leaders I have spoken to have posed.","If information and knowledge are central to democracy, they are conditions for development.","Time and again, when member states and the governments are faced with an insoluble problem, and they're under pressure to do something, that something usually ends up being referred to the U.N."],"Kohei Uchimura":["I would like beautiful gymnastics to be recognized as the best. I want the judges to appreciate things that are not necessarily winning points.","I have a lot of bitter memories from Beijing. Hopefully, we can erase those memories and bring the gold back to Japan.","Four years ago, I felt the importance of the Olympics and how it is different from other events. It's a completely different atmosphere. The main advice I can give my teammates is to try to enjoy the experience.","I've realized the extraordinary power of sports to heal, unite and inspire. I believe the Olympics will serve as the ultimate platform to provide positive changes and I hope to inspire all of Japan through my strong showing there.","I don't think my natural talent is much different to the other gymnasts. It is a matter of how I train and how I think about my training. I also give a lot of thought to my routines.","Japan had the big earthquake in 2011, and the Olympics will be a good opportunity to bring strength to the people of the Tohoku region - and also to show everyone around the world that Japan is doing fine again. These are messages we have to convey through the power of sport."],"Koichi Tanaka":["I cannot say that I was a particularly diligent student, especially during the lower grades.","My natural mother died one month after I was born, apparently due to giving birth at an advanced age.","From my father, I learned the importance of working sincerely at things to which I had committed myself, and to persevere untiringly even in the face of little progress.","My grandmother valued even the smallest of things.","The tenacious character I've possessed since I was a small child propelled me to successfully meet this challenge, and I was able to safely gain acceptance to the university of my choice.","Upon receiving my notification of acceptance to the university, my parents noticed that they were obliged to submit to the university, among other things, a copy of my official family register. After much mental anguish, they decided to inform me of the secret of my birth.","The thought grew strong in me that since I had gone to the trouble of being born, I might as well be useful in helping people live long and healthy lives. And this thought has always resided in the back of my mind.","In 1978, I entered Tohoku University, into the Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Technology.","I suppose the reason I chose electrical engineering was because I had always been interested in electricity, involving myself in such projects as building radios from the time I was a child.","The Faculty of Technology of Tohoku University is renowned for its tradition of practical studies.","In such an environment, I was able to study things that could be of immediate usefulness to the world. That learning experience undoubtedly served me well when I eventually entered the work force.","When it came time to find employment, I set my sights on becoming an engineer at a home electronics manufacturer, a field that was closely related to my major at university.","Most of the work performed by a development engineer results in failure.","However, the occasional visit of success provides just the excitement an engineer needs to face work the following day."],"Kojo Annan":["I admire my father greatly.","I would never play any role in anything that involves the United Nations for obvious reasons.","I feel the whole issue has been a witchhunt from day one as part of a broader Republican political agenda.","What will the U.S. senators have to say if there is, as many over here and in the rest of the world suspect, no substance to the allegations against my father and me?","I have never participated directly or indirectly in any business related to the United Nations.","My father is a man of impeccable character who has worked tirelessly for the United Nations for many years. His integrity is beyond reproach."],"Koko Taylor":["I used to listen to the radio, and when I was about 18 years old, B.B. King was a disc jockey and he had a radio program, 15 minutes a day, over in West Memphis, Arkansas, and he would play the blues.","Blues is my life. It's a true feeling that comes from the heart, not something that just comes out of my mouth. Blues is what I love, and blues is what I always do.","Something magic happens when I get to a club or get on stage.","Up on that stage, my personality changes. I put everything behind me when I perform. My problems don't belong to my fans. I don't put a burden on my audience. I give them 100 percent of my energy.","I was so glad to get out of the cotton patch and stop pickin' cotton, I wouldn't of cared who come by and said, 'I'll take you to Chicago.'"],"Konrad Adenauer":["All parts of the human body get tired eventually - except the tongue.","An infallible method of conciliating a tiger is to allow oneself to be devoured.","In view of the fact that God limited the intelligence of man, it seems unfair that He did not also limit his stupidity.","A thick skin is a gift from God.","History is the sum total of things that could have been avoided.","The rare case where the conquered is very satisfied with the conqueror.","Kennedy cooked the soup that Johnson had to eat.","The art of politics consists in knowing precisely when it is necessary to hit an opponent slightly below the belt.","Only the stupidest calves choose their own butcher."],"Konrad Lorenz":["The bond with a true dog is as lasting as the ties of this earth will ever be.","I owe undying gratitude to my patient parents.","Barking dogs occasionally bite, but laughing men hardly ever shoot.","I have found the missing link between the higher ape and civilized man; it is we.","It is a good morning exercise for a research scientist to discard a pet hypothesis every day before breakfast. It keeps him young.","Ethologists are often accused of drawing false analogies between animal and human behaviour. However, no such thing as a false analogy exists: an analogy can be more or less detailed and, hence, more or less informative.","We had better dispense with the personification of evil, because it leads, all too easily, to the most dangerous kind of war: religious war.","Historians will have to face the fact that natural selection determined the evolution of cultures in the same manner as it did that of species.","Whenever we find, in two forms of life that are unrelated to each other, a similarity of form or of behaviour patterns which relates to more than a few minor details, we assume it to be caused by parallel adaptation to the same life-preserving function.","Evil, by definition, is that which endangers the good, and the good is what we perceive as a value.","I consider early childhood events as most essential to a man's scientific and philosophical development.","Truth in science can be defined as the working hypothesis best suited to open the way to the next better one.","I believe that present day civilized man suffers from insufficient discharge of his aggressive drive.","Most of the vices and mortal sins condemned today correspond to inclinations that were purely adaptive or at least harmless in primitive man.","Every man gets a narrower and narrower field of knowledge in which he must be an expert in order to compete with other people. The specialist knows more and more about less and less and finally knows everything about nothing.","We do not take humor seriously enough.","'I don't need brains,' says the billionaire contemptuously. 'I'm brainy enough myself!' The broker cries out in desperation, 'What, in heaven's name, do you want?' 'Goodness,' is the answer.","I grew up in the large house and the larger garden of my parents in Altenberg. They were supremely tolerant of my inordinate love for animals.","From a neighbour, I got a one-day-old duckling and found, to my intense joy, that it transferred its following response to my person. At the same time, my interest became irreversibly fixated on water fowl, and I became an expert on their behaviour even as a child.","When I was about ten, I discovered evolution by reading a book by Wilhelm Boelsche and seeing a picture of Archaeopteryx.","In the course of evolution, it constantly happens that, independently of each other, two different forms of life take similar, parallel paths in adapting themselves to the same external circumstances.","Practically all animals which move fast in a homogeneous medium have found means of giving their body a streamlined shape, thereby reducing friction to a minimum.","There is indeed the possibility that the evolutionary process has, in gray antiquity, bred into us an excess of aggression.","The father-mother family with two children isolated in a city flat is already insufficient."],"Konrad Zuse":["You could say I was too lazy to calculate, so I invented the computer.","It is not true that virtually all news in a totalitarian state is false.","I have always had a predominantly visual approach to my environment."],"Konrad von Gesner":["Best of all is it to preserve everything in a pure, still heart, and let there be for every pulse a thanksgiving, and for every breath a song."],"Konstantin Tsiolkovsky":["Mankind will not forever remain on Earth but, in the pursuit of light and space, will first timidly emerge from the bounds of the atmosphere and then advance until he has conquered the whole of circumsolar space.","Earth is the cradle of humanity, but one cannot remain in the cradle forever.","The Earth is the cradle of humanity, but mankind cannot stay in the cradle forever.","From the moment of using rocket devices, a great new era will begin in astronomy: the epoch of the more intensive study of the firmament.","All the universe is full of the lives of perfect creatures.","Man must at all costs overcome the Earth's gravity and have, in reserve, the space at least of the Solar System.","I do not remember how it got into my head to make the first calculations related to rocket.

For me, it's always felt like playing my own neurosurgeon, sans anesthesia. As a memoirist, you have to crack your head open and examine every uncomfortable thing in there.","What makes a narcissistic mother so scary? Her absolute power and controlling influence. A narcissistic mother is your only 'friend,' at least until you're old enough to go to school.","I think statistics go in one ear and out the other. All of us respond to stories more than numbers.","If mothers are our first teachers, then having a narcissistic one teaches us that human closeness is terrifying, and the world is a heartless, inconsistent place.","I grew up in a family that despised displays of strong emotion, rage in particular. We stewed. We sulked. When arguments did occur, they were full-scale conniptions, and we regarded them as family failings.","Why is Kris Jenner a powerhouse? Because some part of us confuses fame and infamy, too. If she really bothered us half as much as we claim she does, we'd look away and stop feeding her empire.","I do think anger is so difficult for women. Girls think it undermines their femininity; it's not very ladylike.","I think when you're 14 years old, I think you're sort of looking for markers that prove you're an adult and you're independent of your parents.","I have been a ballerina, a cheerleader and a sorority girl. I was the girliest girl alive.","Reading Poe was like a near-death experience, the kind that makes you feel fragile and free in its wake. I felt almost as though I'd scared myself alive.","I don't know where the idea originated that memoir writing is cathartic. For me, it's always felt like playing my own neurosurgeon, sans anesthesia.","My short stature may have something to do with my tendency to shout when enraged. How else is anyone going to hear me way down here?","In my early to mid-20s, a fear of confrontation made it difficult for me to end relationships in a mature or even quasi-sane way. Instead, I would hang on resentfully, praying that my doomed beau would end things first and spare me the displeasure.

We're not sure if we should repress it. The idea that anger is supposed to be controlled is American, and we try to keep it out of our homes.","We are taught to believe it's bad to be angry, or at least it's not good. That's not the case all throughout the world. People are more open and not embarrassed about it. For instance in Paris, people believe Americans have a really unhealthy relation with anger.

There weren't that many picture books around in the Fifties in Zimbabwe. My favourite was Heinrich Hoffmann's Struwwelpeter, which was really frightening.","Pictures are very important. I remember at home we had illustrated editions of Rudyard Kipling's 'Just So Stories' and 'The Jungle Book,' which were read to me. Living in Zimbabwe made it very real, especially the 'Just So Stories' with the 'great grey-green greasy Limpopo.'","When I visit schools, I try to reach kids who perhaps don't have books at home or aren't that keen on reading. Somehow you draw them in with the pictures and then perhaps they'll want to learn more about it. I use a lot of audience participation and find kids who aren't really part of it and try to include them - to draw in those reluctant readers.","'Winnie The Witch' transgresses all cultural boundaries. Amusingly, there have been attempts to deconstruct the meaning of the books - that Winnie represents society and Wilbur the disabled - but I think it's just a great story.","If I want the day off, the boss never says 'No.' I paint away listening to an iTunes jazz station called KCSM Jazz Radio. It's perfect. Good music and no news traffic or celebrities."],"Kou Shibasaki":["It's quite amazing what 3D is doing to movies. Just simple things like a paper plane flying at you or flower petals fluttering about are wonderful.","I am always getting ideas for song lyrics and keep a notebook handy. Nowadays, I take a laptop with me everywhere, because I have a stock of handwritten lyrics in it.","Wouldn't it fun to be able to communicate with a horse while you were riding it?"],"Kourtney Kardashian":["Being alone & actually sitting with our own thoughts can lead to such growth and realizations that are rare in our everyday busy lives.","I remember, when I went away to college at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, my aunt sent me a book with the rules of being a Southern Belle. One of the rules was to never wear white after Labor Day. Fashion has a lot to do with confidence and making up your own rules.","Motherhood has most definitely changed me and my life. It's so crazy how drastic even the small details change - in such an amazing way. Even silly things, like the fact that all of my pictures on my cell phone used to be of me at photo shoots - conceited, I know! - but now every single picture on my phone is of Mason.","Unless someone has walked in your shoes, you really can't judge. Everyone needs to make the best choice for their life.","Mom always told us to wear pretty, matching underwear.","I've been wearing lipstick since I was in 7th grade. That was our form of daring self-expression, because we had to wear uniforms in school. It made our teachers so angry.","I would love to design a maternity clothing line. It is so hard to find stylish clothes for pregnant people... I would say 99 percent of the clothes I wore were not maternity because I couldn't find anything I liked.","I love and appreciate the bonding time with Mason. Nursing is surprisingly one of my favorite things.","I really love working with my sisters, doing photo shoots with my sisters and appearances all together.","I'm proof that, even after having a baby, you can look better and sexier than ever!","I wouldn't say I'm strict. I love to communicate with my kids, and I constantly check in and try to talk things through instead.","I definitely don't want to get married just for the sake of getting married.","For me, juggling mommyhood and work is a challenge, but each day I learn little tricks to make it all come together.","I have oatmeal every morning with whole milk, bananas, and cinnamon, and it's just the best thing ever.","I love things that are easy to throw on, that I don't have to think about. Like skinny jeans and a T-shirt is easy for me.","Fashion is so subjective, and I think it should be playful.","Interior decor is my guilty pleasure. If I'm going to splurge on something, it's more for my home than for clothes.","Being a mom is what life is about. I hope people realize what the priorities in life should be and know not everything has to be perfect.","There's no one else I would rather have as my manager than my mom because I know that she has our best interests at heart. Sometimes, it's hard to separate manager mode from mom mode. I think as our manager, my mom will get more emotional about situations than she would if she was just our manager.","I find a pregnant body to be beautiful and an incredible reminder of what a woman's body is made to do.","I do become a recluse once in a while. It's so nice to just be at home and to not have to deal with the outside world.","I think it's important to talk to my sisters when I have a big decision to make.","I think with boys... it's all about shoes. I've seen so many little boys, and their outfits are so cute, and then their moms put kind of dorky shoes on them.","One of my favorite things to do is go running early in the morning when everyone in my house is still sleeping. I throw on my iPod, and it's, like, my time.","Everyday... well, if I'm doing it myself, I have my five-minute makeup routine, which is I do tinted moisturizer, and then I do a quick concealer, and I use our bronzer every day. And then I have to curl my lashes, and then I do our Quickie mascara, and that's it.","I feel tired, but in general, I do love being pregnant and always feel pretty good. I'm lucky. I always hear, like, horror stories.","I'm probably the least harsh on myself, and I try not to scrutinize everything about my body. As a new mom, it is what it is, and we just have to do our best.","I've been applying makeup long enough to feel good doing it on my own, but I cannot do my hair to save my life. When left to my own devices, if I have to go to an event, I do a slicked bun. Otherwise, I just try to wear a hat, put it in a ponytail, or do a side braid - something easy.","I was surprised that everyone calls it 'morning sickness,' because it lasted all day. For me, it was even worse at night. During my first two pregnancies, I felt so nauseous all day that I could only eat plain toast and bland foods - no proteins.","I love to read books that focus on parenting topics because there are so many different ways to do things. I find these books offer a lot of great opinions on many different subjects.","When every moment is constantly being filmed, it's hard to relax.","I feel that if I'm going through something, I'm sure someone else is, too. I try to be as honest with myself and others as I can be.","I am the worst at doing my hair. I have no clue how to do it; I just feel like I need to go to hair beauty school or something because it's really becoming a problem.","I have had breast implants, but it's so funny 'cause it's not a secret; I could care less.","I don't think anyone can fall in love for ratings.","I'm five feet tall - I'm very petite - so for me, if I'm wearing a skirt or dress, it needs to be short, or else it makes me look frumpy. I need to wear either something really short or a maxi dress; anything in between just looks weird.","I used to play Donna Karan. I used my dad's home office, and Kim was my assistant. Then one of our friends would play a buyer, and I would take her to my mom's closet and show her the new collection.","Growing up, I never heard my parents curse, never. The first time I ever said a curse word was with my sister Kim.","I feel such a sense of empowerment being a mom. But I do wonder: How do they/we do it all?","When I was pregnant, a few of my friends told me that their babies slept in bed with them. I remember thinking how crazy that was. Then I started reading up on it and decided it was something I actually wanted to try.","I know that, for me, I need to try to cover myself while breastfeeding so that no one snaps a picture. If this wasn't the case, I probably wouldn't mind as much because my son is my biggest concern. My attitude is, if someone sees a little somethin' somethin', don't look if you don't like it.","People always have something to say about how long is too long or not long enough to breastfeed. I think this is such a personal decision that it can only be made between each baby and his or her mommy.","I wish that when we weren't filming, we could have full privacy. I wish I could live in a bubble and just be with my family.","Sometimes I just wish nobody knew who I was.","My best friend and I went to sleep-away camp every summer. We'd share stories of making out with boys, but we never did, so we made it all up. My real first kiss was at a friend's house when I was in junior high. He was such a good kisser, and we're still close friends!","My stepdad is Bruce Jenner, the Olympian. The first time he came over was like a blind date, and we had show and tell. He took out the gold medal for me and my sisters, and we were like, 'So? Who the hell are you?'","I have so many pieces that once belonged to my mom and both of my grandmothers. All of these pieces are very sentimental, and I love to wear them. I also have many pieces from my father that I probably cherish the most. I love wearing his dress shirts.","I loved dressing for my pregnant body. A pregnant woman's body is so beautiful. Towards the end, it does get harder, and then it became all about flats and comfortable maxi dresses.","Sometimes I think, 'Why should I work out when I can spend time with my kids?' I feel guilty doing something for me.","I love Audrey Hepburn.","I would say a lack of sleep is a cause for feeling not so beautiful. On those days, I try to drink lots of water and put on the biggest sunglasses I can find.","Now that I have a daughter, I've been thinking about how I'll define beauty to her. I watched a video of Kendall when she was three, and she was putting on makeup. I don't know how I feel about that. But my daughter already watches me do it. When do you let them start wearing it? I don't know yet.","I love Oreos.","My daily style is easy and effortless - I don't like to take too much time getting ready.","My mom and both of my grandmothers have always been into fashion, so it's been around us our whole lives.","I think I forget every time - you give birth, and you want your stomach to be flat again. It does take a lot of work, but I usually start slowly by going on walks with the baby.","I remember playing in my mom's closet with Kim as little girls - we had this game we played, I was Donna Karan, and she was my assistant, and I was really bossy.","I've always loved children's clothes - my grandmother actually owned a children's boutique in La Jolla, CA, for 30 years. I grew up visiting her and working in her store, and then my mom and I had a children's boutique together for five or six years.","I remember when I first found out I was having a boy, I became obsessed with buying boys' clothes. Then came my daughter, and I was obsessed with buying girls' clothes. Everything looks 10 million times cuter when it's teeny-tiny.","My entire life changed when I became a mother - my priorities, my understanding, appreciation of life, and my relationship with God.","Women always ask me how to get back in shape after having a baby. I always say, 'Know when's the right time for your workout and commit to doing it.'","The first place I gain weight is in my rear end. I love my butt, but I have a tendency to get saddlebags there, so I need to watch it.","I love being pregnant in general.","Before Christmas, I host a party for our kids and all their friends. We love to make a mess while decorating gingerbread houses.","Since we started putting together our makeup collection, Kardashian Beauty, I've been extra invested in our list of no-no ingredients. It's an ingredients black list that we don't allow into the products - no parabens, no sulfates.","When I do my own makeup, I always start with Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer.","For my eyes, my day-to-day just involves curling my lashes to open up my eyes and applying our mascara, The Quickie. If I'm getting my makeup done, I like to get individual lash extensions or a strip of false lashes, depending on how glam I want to get.","We're definitely honest with each other... if your sisters can't tell you that you look ridiculous, who can?","The Kollection is a complete mix of Kim, Khloe and I - each of our individual styles are reflected, and that has been the way we have always designed. We are constantly emailing each other with ideas - three minds are better than one sometimes.","Nothing comes before my children. I find that putting everything else in order of importance also helps to get everything done.","First dates are so awkward and annoying. I think a casual and fun first date with friends is much more fun than a one-on-one typical first date.","I don't think fame is that important to me.","We've always wanted to do a clothing line, and I personally love doing stuff with my sisters; I think it makes the whole process that much better.","I nursed Mason for 14 months and Penelope for 16, and I loved it. It was built-in time that the two of us could share alone every day. I didn't have any goals or expectations.","I witnessed a home birth with my sister Khloe and, after seeing it, I felt it wasn't for me. There was too much risk involved, and it wasn't as sanitary as a hospital.","After Mason was born, I'd feel guilty doing anything that wasn't related to work.","After my daughter was born, I made a promise to myself to live in the moment.","I am obsessed with my sisters. Being the oldest, I probably just have that in me. But I also think I am the youngest sometimes. We all have moments when we are the maternal one of the group."],"Kratika Sengar":["I didn't enjoy my college life in Noida much because I was quite disoriented there, since I was staying away from my family.","Whatever is shown in a TV show is a reflection of society.","I may be smaller in size, but I'm pretty feisty. I don't give up easily once I get started.","I am really thankful to everyone around, as Mumbai has given me a lot.","When I am not working, I go out on vacations with my family and enjoy a lot.","I was doing specialisation in advertising. I had no interest in acting. One of my friends, who was doing specialisation in films, made a short film casting me. Luckily, I got a break, and my acting career took off.","'Service Wali Bahu,' like most other serials, cater to women audiences and is aimed at smaller towns where people are home by sunset.","If the bond between a husband and his wife is strong, then I think they complete each other, and the relationship also survives longer.","I see so many people who are not keen on getting married because they are busy working and doing their own stuff. In fact even I thought I wouldn't get married, but then luckily, I met Nikitin, and everything changed for good.","While choosing shows, I look at stories and the concept, and that has to be different.","TRP ratings affect me. There are times when the ratings are so low that we feel that we could have done something more. But that is about it. I don't stress over it too much.","There are some channels that are trying out new content. These shows have new and fresh stories. The trend on TV is changing, and along with this, there are web series, too. But the audience needs to get used to these stories.","I would love to be in a biopic, but I'm not looking at being a part of Bolywood.","I'm very happy, safe, and secure with television industry. I'm not over-ambitious.","Fans are very emotional people, and when they have seen you with some people and they like your chemistry, they expect you to work with the same person again.","In real life, I am not a romantic person. I am a fun person and a complete tomboy.","Being an actor, I feel I need to take up challenges and do different roles without thinking about whether the audience will accept me in those roles or not.","I love to swim and listen to good music.","I don't have many friends in the television industry, as I am an introvert who likes her own set of friends. I also don't plan for the future and believe in living for the moment.","Both me and Nikitin are protective when it comes to our relationship. We would not like if someone comes and tells that 'Oh your chemistry is better with your co-actor than real life husband.'","In a marriage, we have to accommodate each other's views.","When it comes to work, I have a lot of patience, but otherwise, I am quite impatient.","I have never done intimate scenes on any of my shows, and now, after marriage, it's a complete 'No.'","I am not that ambitious to do films. I am very happy and secure doing TV.","I have never been a pet lover or really craved the idea of having dogs.","I came to Mumbai for my internship in advertising in an ad agency. Back then, a senior from my college who was working for Balaji asked whether I wanted to act. I agreed, and I didn't even know when it became my passion and my hobby.","If you ask me, I have not really seen any negative side of this industry. I have not met those kinds of people who can change the way I see this industry and make me feel that it's a bad or a dark place.","I put in a lot of effort for a show like 'Jhansi Ki Rani,' and it worked. I think I am very lucky I have done that show!"],"Kreayshawn":["I'm not really concerned with trying to turn haters into believers.","People be saying, 'Watch - when she gets some money, she's going to get a Gucci purse.' But I don't think that's my style. I like finding random stuff and random brands. Maybe one day when I'm sophisticated and older I might settle down and invest in a nice leather handbag.","I like playing my Tamagotchi and Game Boy. They take me back to the old days when times were more simple.","Waka Flocka Flame, some of his lyrics are, like, common sentences. But just the way he is, and the way he delivers it, makes it this crazy metal hip-hop.","My mom was in a punk rock band called The Trash Women, and they toured and all of that. She had me when she was 17.","I was born in San Francisco. I was raised in Oakland, so I'm, like, super Bay Area born, and, you know, it's just really multicultural up there, and there's a lot of subcultures just from, like, anything, like from rockabilly to, like, crazy punk scenes to, you know, a huge rap scene, and there's just all kinds of things you can do out there.","Like, you can't tell a certain race, like, 'You're supposed to act this way, and you're not supposed to act this way because of what color you are,' like, that's just holding everybody back, you know what I'm saying?","If I grew up, you know, in the ghetto, like, and I wasn't taught any other way to talk or a way to act or other food to eat or just like anything like that, like, when I'm I supposed to do? You know, like, is there a class I'm supposed to take to learn how to be white, you know?","In L.A., like, there's a lot of, like, materialism, and, you know, people who think they're better than each other because of the clothes they wear or how they dress, and in Oakland, it's not like that.","When I grow up, I want to be like Diplo, for sure.","My favorite lie was the online rumor that Bruce Willis was my uncle. That's hilarious.","I know Diplo knows a lot about underground music culture - he was one of the people to put me onto music like that when I used to listen to the Mad Decent Mixes. It was like, 'Oh, he knows what I want.'","I wanna make stuff that sonically sounds really good. I don't wanna make a song about how people think I'm this when I'm really that. I don't wanna make a song about how I grew up broke.","I am an artsy girl. It's no secret that I am artsy, you know.","Guys usually like my sense of humor, and I am pretty down to earth. And I'm a driven person.","I always see guys get all, like, flexed on other people, trying to show off that they are tough, and it is just, like, no girl really likes that.","I have always had stuff on the Internet. Way back in the Myspace days, I had a lot of friends on Myspace. And it is just all about, like, networking - contacting people and showing people, like, your mind.","I'm, like, a person who likes love. And I can find love in any type of person. I've dated girls, and I've liked girls. But they're usually straight girls, so it never works out. I mean, I'm not that gay, so I don't have the energy to convince someone else to be gay, you know?","I had braces; I was lucky, 'cause I had some snaggle teeth. I always try and keep my retainer on me 'cause I'm paranoid about my teeth. It was run over by a car, so half of it's missing, but it still works.","I love Claw Money. They always send me stuff. I always wear their sweatpants.","Honestly, if a girl's wearing, like, a Gucci shirt with a Gucci belt and a purse and a visor, that's not cute at all. You can't get away with that - with me - but you can always sprinkle it in there with your own stuff, and it's all good.","Sometimes I'll dress like a boy, sometimes I'll dress like a Japanese crazy teenybopper. I have clothes from the 7th grade that I've kept and still wear.","I like Goodwill and the thrift stores. I don't like going into a store and picking from a bunch of cute stuff that's already been found. One of the best parts is finding it myself.","I don't only like rap music. There's everything from R&B to crazy gangster rap, hip hop... everything! But it all blends together nicely. It's like a magical music rainbow.","I'm obsessed with horrible movies.","I was super-obsessed with the Spice Girls. Ginger was my favorite. They had a tour in 2008, and my home girls went, but I didn't have the money to go!"],"Kresley Cole":["I've been a huge fan of all things paranormal my whole life. For me, it was always a question of when, not if, I was going to write a paranormal series. I dipped my toe in the genre by incorporating a mystical curse into the 'MacCarrick Brothers Trilogy.'","If I could sum up 'Shadow's Claim' in six words: cage fights with hot alpha males. Seriously, though, while the fights are the backdrop for Trehan and Bettina's love story, the main emphasis is on how Trehan - a pitiless master assassin - wages the ultimate battle to win her heart.","One of my favorite things to do is formulate powers for a character, then come up with their corresponding weaknesses and liabilities. And I delight in world-building: melding the supernatural with the natural, then tweaking and polishing until it feels organic.","I always favor the hero and heroine from whichever book I've completed most recently. Yes, I'm faithless and fickle!","The one test I have for every completed book is if I feel head over heels in love with the hero. If he hasn't stolen my heart from the previous hero, I know the book isn't right.","Before the final battle in 'Poison Princess,' Evie remembered how to use her Empress powers, practiced with them to the point of exhaustion, then had a trial by fire. In a way, she earned those powers, as she hadn't before, so that was certainly a confidence builder.","I write what I like to read, and I enjoy love triangles in YA and adult fiction - not to mention in other media like TV, opera, theatre, and even in video games! I relish when dark and compelling characters compete for our protagonist's heart. The doubts, the uncertainty - the jealousy! - can be breathtaking.","I enjoy a good cliffhanger. As a reader, I relish that nervous feeling you get when you're engrossed in a story, but in the back of your mind you're aware that there aren't that many pages left. How will it end? Everything can't be wrapped up! This can't end! Then it does, and your heart seems to stop.","As the installments in the 'Immortals After Dark' series span simultaneous timelines, making sure the details remained accurate was a hair-raising/losing exercise.","My toughest criticism usually comes from myself. As my editor can attest to, I'm never done tweaking a book until the production department has to rip it from my hands!","In 'Dark Skye,' I rewrote every one of the Pandemonia scenes over and over before I was happy with them - hundreds of pages are now sitting in a folder called 'Cuttings,' never to be read. Ouch!","My husband, a.k.a. Swede, and I both come from athletic backgrounds, so once we identified the goal - get book published - we attacked it. At any given time, I would have my writing out in 25 various forms - either contests, mentoring critiques, agent/publisher queries, etc."],"Kris Allen":["I love going to Africa and stuff. I love going anywhere, really, but I've been to Africa a bunch of times and it's just a beautiful place that needs help, obviously, but helping people that are really thankful is really easy to do. And the people out there always seem so thankful.","I love really good food and I don't ever want to spend too much for it, but I like hanging out and having really good, tasty, interesting food.","For me, my guilty pleasure is that if I don't want to do anything one day, I won't. I'll just sit around, not shower, hardly even eat, and just watch TV.","II know very, very little about the ukulele, but I actually grew up playing the viola from 4th grade through high school.","When you're on tour, you're trying to get the crowd involved and really sing and perform to them. When you're going to write and be in the studio, it's like, 'Now I have to think about me.' That's the mind-set you have to work with.","It would be fun to write with Adele, actually. She seems like a fun girl to write with.","Michael Jackson was the biggest star the world has ever seen - he put so much into everything; a lot of attention to detail. I want to do that. I want to pay that kind of attention to detail in everything - in music, visually - all of that.","Music has always been a part of my life.","I would love to just talk to Paul McCartney. That would be incredible, but that is definitely like a dream.","Someone asked me a while back, 'Why do artists always write about love?' And I was like, 'Love is the coolest thing that's ever happened in the world.'","I'm a huge fan of music in schools and music education because that's how I grew up.","Well, when you're recording an album, artists have what they feel like is good music, and the label, they're trying to sell the album. So those two ideas clash sometimes, but in the end it always works out. When you put the two together, that's a good thing.","When you write an album and you're writing about relationships, the stuff that I've been through in my relationships, 99 percent of it is really good, but it's that one percent that always inspires you to write a song.","Jive has been really, really good to me.","I've always been a procrastinator.","Arkansas is really, really nice. It's got the nature feel.","I am a huge sports fan.","I'm not a man of many words, I'm not very expressive or emotional, but it comes out in my music.","I love any kind of candy.","My favorite TV show ever is 'Boy Meets World,' and my favorite movie is 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off.'","I'm just going to go out there, and if people want to put me on the front of their magazine or whatever, that's fine. If they don't, that's fine as well. I'm just going to go out there and make my music.","I tell people this: It's hard to write about walking in the park, but it's easy to write about a breakup.","Journaling is something that I've always tried to get into.","I say the stupidest stuff, all the time, off of Twitter, and so I think Twitter is good way for people to get to know the stupid side of me.","I've always wanted to be a dad.","It's hard to write music for specific things, because I'm always writing just to write.","I love playing with a full band, but there's just like a different feeling up on stage when you're playing with a smaller group. It's easier to play off each other.","I have an amazing relationship with my wife, but sometimes there are arguments. It happens.","I write love songs!","I'm not a terrible person, I know that, but sometimes in a relationship, I can be crappy.","I love pop music, but I love pop music that does something a little bit different.","My wife gets mad at me, because I'll worry more about my friends than I worry about myself.","I want my music to feel like I'm giving something to someone else and not that I'm expecting something back.","I love my fans because they're smart, dude.","My dad was a musician. He was a singer and he played the guitar, so music was always around.","I like Mutemath a lot.","I am really laid back and kind of go-with-the-flow, but I will never do anything that I don't believe in.","For me, I feel like I relate to a lot of people.","When I was 17, I broke up with my future wife."],"Kris Carr":["If you don't think your anxiety, depression, sadness and stress impact your physical health, think again. All of these emotions trigger chemical reactions in your body, which can lead to inflammation and a weakened immune system. Learn how to cope, sweet friend. There will always be dark days.","You can't please everyone. When you're too focused on living up to other people's standards, you aren't spending enough time raising your own. Some people may whisper, complain and judge. But for the most part, it's all in your head. People care less about your actions than you think. Why? They have their own problems!","There's a great metaphor that one of my doctors uses: If a fish is swimming in a dirty tank and it gets sick, do you take it to the vet and amputate the fin? No, you clean the water. So, I cleaned up my system. By eating organic raw greens, nuts and healthy fats, I am flooding my body with enzymes, vitamins and oxygen.","Your self-worth has nothing to do with your craft or calling, and everything to do with how you treat yourself.","Dinner is where the magic happens in the kitchen.","Honestly, self-care is not fluffy - it's something we should take seriously.","If I had my dream, we'd all be eating more plants and less garbage.","Folks are like plants; we all lean toward the light.","The gaunt, unhealthy vegan is the muffin vegan. Bread and fries and processed veggie dogs. It's like, 'Hello? Did you eat your vegetables?'","Sleep is the best time to repair, but it's hard to get a good night's rest when we don't dial the inner chatter down.","Life is a terminal condition. Were all going to die. Cancer patients just have more information, but we all, in some ways, wait for permission to live.","Yes, I have cancer and it might not go away, but I can still have a future because life goes on.","My refrigerator is powerful. In fact, it has a direct link to my overall well-being.","Make space in your life, space for health and happiness.","If it has a shelf life longer than you, don't eat it.","Guilt is a poisonous illusion. Many languages don't even have a word for guilt. Sure, we all feel it. But we also get to decide if we're going to let guilt bring us down or not. Acknowledge the feelings, and then give yourself permission to let them go.","Processed foods cause inflammation, a source of most chronic illnesses as well as stress.","We're so conditioned to believe that milk does a body good and that we need enormous amounts of protein or we'll wither away. Look around, we're not withering - we're fat.","Whether you're reaching for one of your favorite cookbooks or just winging it, do your best to keep a well-stocked arsenal of healthy ingredients at your disposal. At the very least, you'll always be ready to whip up a green juice or smoothie.","Trust is a core currency of any relationship. Sometimes our need to control and micromanage everything erodes our confidence in ourselves and others. The truth: People are much more capable than we think. A hearty dose of trust is often what's needed to unlock the magic. Go ahead, have faith.","Above all, cancer is a spiritual practice that teaches me about faith and resilience.","If I let a blue mood run rampant, before I know it I'm obsessing about the color of the satin lining in my coffin - will it match my dress? That's when I feel like Alice in Cancerland falling down the rabbit hole and just have to stop.","Eventually cancer becomes just another annoying thing that you deal with, you know, like cellulite.","People ask me if I live each day like it's my last, and I don't. I live each day like it's my first, and I can't wait for the next one.","If it is made in a lab then it takes a lab to digest.","You don't have to become a vegan. You can become a plant-passionate, plant-inspired bean lover!","There's nothing sexy about cancer.","Cancer is very chaotic.","Every time I see a cardinal, I know my grandmother is with me. This regal, red bird was Grandma's favorite.","At one of my lowest points, sugar had a painful grip on me. I'd buy/binge and then beat myself up over my behavior.","While I may never be in remission from cancer, I am currently in remission from an unhealthy relationship to food.","Change your plate. Change your fate.","I'm a leftover junkie.","Gut health is the key to overall health.","When you bite off only what you can chew, you're going to disappoint people. Guess what? Not your problem. You're not doing anything wrong.","When you're the conscious captain in your kitchen, you'll feel better mentally and physically.","I was asleep at the wheel before cancer shook me awake.","If you really want to turn your health around, start juicing today.","When our purpose is external, we may never find it. If we tie our purpose or meaning to our vocation, goal or an activity, we're more than likely setting ourselves up for suffering down the line.","I cherish my work and all of my readers.","'Cancer' is such a frightening word.","I tell people, 'I have a Ph.D. from Google University.'","I think that life is just too sweet to be bitter.","I kind of blossomed backwards. I got cancer, fell in love and have a magical life. I never imagined it would happen that way, but you just go with the flow, right?","I knew when I was diagnosed with cancer the only thing I could control was what I ate, what I drank and what I would think."],"Kris Gopalakrishnan":["Politics is not my cup of tea. I would like to focus on research and education, and will also work to help start-up ecosystem.","Infosys was founded and run by professionals.","Continuing on my theme of backing inclusive innovations, I am optimistic of the success of Uniphore. Man-machine communication is one of the more complex problems to solve. Uniphore's vision lends possibility of finding a solution to this very difficult problem, and the company has already made substantial progress.","FreshWorld is in line with my vision of supporting sustainable technologies in solving problems. I feel this is the next-level disruption in the fruits and vegetables industry.","Everything we can think of that should have a processor, and they'll all be connected. People talk about fridges re-ordering when you run out of milk, but it's going to be much bigger than that. The transition to this world will require a huge number of applications to be developed, and that's a huge opportunity for Infosys.","Enterprises are just starting to adopt and integrate the iPad into their networks, but this is accelerating, and that's an opportunity for Infosys.","I am delighted to invest in JetSynthesys and join the Board as Non-Executive Chairman. JetSynthesys aims to become the platform of choice for digital content and experience. We have invested extensively in backend technology infrastructure that is best in class in the world.","Axilor Ventures helps startups to improve their odds of success, and I look forward to supporting the executive management of Axilor with this vision.","Engineering college students should be encouraged to start entrepreneurial ventures in their second year itself. It is safer to fail while in college.","With a traditional human resources system, we would work with a company, select the product, customise and implement the system, and our job would be over. Some companies are changing and asking why do they need to own the HR system when they can connect to an Internet service and pay as you go?","Infosys, with the rest of the Indian IT industry, has transformed the image of India around the world, transformed the image of Indian professionals, creating huge opportunities for them.","Nobody programmes the brain, yet it keeps learning. India shouldn't miss the emerging age of brain-inspired computing."],"Kris Holden-Ried":["I grew up reading a lot of fantasy/sci-fi. It was really all I read - anything from 'Dragonlance,' when I was 12, to 'The Wheel of Time' and Robert Jordan stuff, to George R.R. Martin, who did 'Game of Thrones.'","I love period pieces. It's where my skill sets lie, with the horseback riding, the sword fighting and the accents. I love that world, and I love working on those big, epic shows. That's what I hope to find myself in, in the future.","Really, acting is like anything else. The more time you put in, the more you learn and the more you can give back to the industry.","It turns out that I've become a pretty good werewolf actor. I'm going to have to try to get myself into a different position, at some point in the future, but I'll take werewolf. Werewolf is pretty damn fun to play.","I actually did want to be an actor when I was younger, but my father didn't want to hear anything about it. And you know what? I went with his decision. I said, 'Yeah, maybe you're right. I don't know anything about acting.'","I was on the national Pentathlon team for a few years, but there was no funding for athletes in Canada. I was in a massive amount of personal debt at the age of 21, so I joined a little modelling and talent agency to get a some work, to do anything so that I didn't have to drop out of school.","Fencing is a funny sport. Competitive fencing is not really very applicable to the stage world unless you're fighting with a rapier during the Renaissance, you know?","I always gravitated a bit towards more of the fantasy, and 'Lost Girl' really fits in with that.","I grew up reading a lot of fantasy/sci-fi.","'Lost Girl' has just proven to be one of those shows that people enjoy watching. It has an alchemy about it. It's an escape or a release for people, and that's the best we can hope for.","I always thought I was doing something special with 'Lost Girl.' How that would be reflected or responded to by the fans, I hadn't really considered. That they are so loyal is amazing. We have such lovely fans."],"Kris Humphries":["I don't talk to media or anyone before games. I just put my headphones on, turn up some hip-hop, and get in the zone.","I also eat fruit instead of drinking juices. That's something I've read up on. I think that if you drink a lot of fruit juice you take in way too much sugar. You'd be better off eating a bunch of strawberries or apples.","My whole mindset in training is to be explosive and fast, and I try not to get too big and bulky.","It's not superstition, but I do everything exactly the same on game days. I'm a creature of habit. I eat the same breakfast, and then I drive the same way to practice. Then I come back and eat the same exact same lunch before every game.","I eat about 4,500 calories every day, but I eat only nutritious, organic foods, and I don't eat added sugars.","I think the way I eat is the foundation of my performance.","I'm someone who always comes on the court no matter what's going on in my life. It's all about basketball and my teammates and my team. I don't let any distractions in, and I bring my best every night, regardless of what's going on or what people are talking about.","I don't always match up with guys like Dwight Howard or Andrew Bynum, but when I do, those guys are a challenge. Dwight, for example, is quick, explosive, and strong all in one."],"Kris Jenner":["I am living my dream because I get to work with my kids and watch them find their happiness. It's so rewarding - we brainstorm around a conference table and have a really great time doing it.","I worry about my grandchildren because the Internet can be brutal.","I love the creative process and being able to build something out of nothing.","I'm strong enough and have a pretty thick skin, but when people go after my kids, I just hit block-delete, block-delete. It's my mantra.","I raised my kids kind of old-fashioned - if you don't have something nice to say, then don't say it at all. I teach love, acceptance, and tolerance... I sometimes think that this generation is lacking in decency.","When my kids are happy, I am happy.","I like everything a certain way. I'm not somebody who can just lay back and let it happen... And I think that's what's gotten me to where I am in life.","I have learned to be ready for anything - and be there for my kids. That's what life's all about.","There's a lot of people that have great ideas and dreams and whatnot, but unless you're willing to work really, really hard, and work for what you want, it's never going to happen.","Oh, my goodness, I am obsessed with Costco! We do runs at least twice a week. I love the salmon and rotisserie chicken, the dog beds.","I guess if I get a little weird about something that isn't the way I want it, and I complain, then it's called controlling.","When I was young, I loved shopping at a store on Rodeo Drive called Lina Lee. Shopping there made me feel so special.","Costco is a passion. Costco is like a massage."],"Kris Kristofferson":["To me, if you love it enough to devote your life to it, then you're doing the right thing.","I enjoy looking back on my life. I'm thinking seriously about starting to write about it.","You don't paddle against the current, you paddle with it. And if you get good at it, you throw away the oars.","I grew up in a time when people believed in duty, honor and country. My grandfathers were both officers. My father was a General in the Air Force. My brother and I were both in the Army. I've always felt a kinship with soldiers; I think it's possible to support the warrior and be against the war.","Dylan's relationship with Johnny Cash was the biggest influence on Nashville in my lifetime - they opened up country music.","I have a special place in my heart for Nashville because it saved my life back in the day.","Never give up, which is the lesson I learned from boxing. As soon as you learn to never give up, you have to learn the power and wisdom of unconditional surrender, and that one doesn't cancel out the other; they just exist as contradictions. The wisdom of it comes as you get older.","I feel like I'm kind of lazy, but I keep the yard looking good.","There are points in your life, especially if you have creative ambitions, where selfishness is necessary.","'Sunday Morning Coming Down' is probably the most directly autobiographical thing I'd written. In those days, I was living in a slum tenement that was torn down afterwards, but it was $25 a month in a condemned building, and 'Sunday Morning Coming Down' was more or less looking around me and writing about what I was doing.","If you can't get out of something, get into it.","There was a film that really affected me, 'La Strada' by Fellini, where Anthony Quinn and Giulietta Masina travel around on his little motorcycle thing.","I feel like sometimes, when I'm singing a song like 'Moment of Forever,' that it goes both to your significant other and to the audience, and was it wonderful for you, you know? I think the best love songs I've written work on that level, like 'Help Me Make It Through the Night.'","Johnny Cash's legacy, I think if it was one word, it would be 'integrity.' He was the original wild man and grew from that guy that was doing all the crazy things that you read that rock n' rollers do to being someone who was like the father of our country, you know. He was a guest at the White House. He was Billy Graham's friend.","I have no regrets. I feel very grateful for the life that I had - you know, family I live with; and I've been doing work that I love, ever since I came to Nashville.","I've had a life of all kinds of experiences - most of them good. And I've got eight kids and a wife that puts up with everything I do and keeps me out of trouble.","I was never big or fast, but I got to play football and box.","I think that a society lives or dies according to its respect for - for its art.","Havin' Dylan cover one of your songs is like being a playwright and having Shakespeare act in your play.","I thought he was the greatest thing. Bob Dylan.","Every time I turn on the radio, I must be on the wrong song or something. But, to be honest, since I went on the road back in 1970, I didn't listen to radio music because I didn't want to subconsciously steal somebody's stuff.","Your weight has to be behind the punch to make it matter.","I remember I had an actor friend - a close friend from college - Anthony Zerbe. He sent me a telegram before I started my first movie, 'Cisco Pike.' It said, 'Have a good time. Ignore the camera.' That was the extent of my training.","Just the words and melody - that's what moves your emotions.","I had fought for my independence and fought for my freedom to do as I chose.","Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose.","Nothing ain't worth nothing but it's free.","Johnny Cash has always been larger than life.","Tell the truth. Sing with passion. Work with laughter. Love with heart. 'Cause that's all that matters in the end.","If God made anything better than women, I think he kept it for himself.","Freedom is just another word: It seems to get truer the older I get.","I think I'm a much better father as an older man than I was with my first kids. Occasionally, I have to yell at the little guys, but they don't take me seriously. 'Listen to the old guy,' they say. 'Isn't he great? He's mad.'","I've been writing songs since I was a little boy. You know, I think I wrote my first song when I was 11.","If God made anything better than women, he kept it for himself.","I got scars on my face that tell some kind of story. I'm looking in the mirror, and I got one scar that's really two scars - half from a baseball bat and half from playing football in college. I'll tell you, though, after a while, your face gets so wrinkled up you can hardly see them.","I had a list of rules I made up one time. It says: Tell the truth, sing with passion, work with laughter, and love with heart. Those are good to start with, anyway.","I boxed in Golden Gloves at Oxford and still know how to throw a straight left jab.","I never thought of acting as a creative process. Christ, I used to go to the movies and see Brando talking like he was trying to sell shoes, and he was great. I thought anybody could do it. Then I tried it, and I got so uptight, I'm limited as to what I can do on film.","I've never forgotten a single record I cut or a song I wrote.","The closest I've come to knowing myself is in losing myself. That's why I loved football before I loved music. I could lose myself in it.","The one thing I regret is missing the time with my older children when they were young.","When I was thirty, and a long time after that, I felt like I had to leave home to do what I had to do. Now, it's just the opposite.","I feel so lucky to have lived the life that I did and to be surrounded by the people I love. I've got eight kids, and they're always laughing all the time. It's like music to my ears. I think that my frame of mind these days is probably happier than I've ever been, which is kind of odd, coming close to the finish line.","I never was one to go into an office and write. For one thing, I had a job. I was cleaning the ashtrays and setting up the studios at Columbia for a couple of years and working every other week down in the Gulf of Mexico flying helicopters. I didn't really get to just write songs for about five years.","I always had to wait until something hit me, and I could write it. But when I would cut an album, to me it represented the time that I spent since the last one. Just the way I was looking at the world.","I wish my memory weren't so bad. They tell me it's from all the football and boxing and the concussions that I got.","Those 'Idol' shows are kind of scary to me. They wanted me to be on one of those panels one time, and I said it's the last thing in the world I'd ever want to do. I would hate to have to discourage somebody.","The great thing about Nashville back in the day was that the old guys hung out where the young guys were. The established writers like Harlan Howard and Jack Clement gave us encouragement and passed the guitar, you know? Chet Atkins let me sit in on his sessions. Everybody was good to us, and everybody loved the music.","I hope that I'll keep being creative until they throw dirt on me.","I am grateful every morning I wake up. I've a big family full of kids, who laugh all the time and love each other.","Everything that I write is sort of autobiographical, and I don't know that I'm getting better, but I'm certainly running out of time.","To me, the best love songs work on two - maybe three - different levels, where you're talking about the person who you're right opposite, and all the people like that.","When I wrote 'Help Me Make It Through the Night,' I was on an oil platform out in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico and was just thinking of myself.","I was in Nicaragua with the Sandinistas. I've argued for Leonard Peltier, Mumia Abu-Jamal, the United Farm Workers. I've been a radical for a long time. I guess it's too bad. I'd be more marketable as a right-wing redneck. But I got into this to tell the truth as I saw it.","I was working the Gulf of Mexico on oil rigs, flying helicopters. I'd lost my family to my years of failing as a songwriter. All I had were bills, child support, and grief. And I was about to get fired for not letting 24 hours go between the throttle and the bottle. It looked like I'd trashed my act. But there was something liberating about it.","By not having to live up to people's expectations, I was somehow free.","There are a lot of Iraqi people we can never pay back for what we've done.","I really have no anxiety about controlling my own life.","I don't think I'm that good a singer. I can't think of a song that I've written that I don't like the way somebody else sings it better.","I feel like an old boxer. The brain's gone, but I can still move around.","I can interpret my own work honestly. And performing by myself seems to focus the attention in the right places.","That's who I wanted to be like was Bob Dylan.","Human rights is something that wasn't hard to be inspired to write about because there have been so many violations of those rights.","If it hadn't been for Johnny Cash, I'd probably have been a Nashville songwriter because that's what I had done for almost five years.","It's much better being an older father. You don't have to go prove to the world and to yourself that you're who you want to be, for better or worse.","What really makes me happy now is my home. I know that I have that to lose. But I don't see losing it. And I don't care if I never do another movie. And I don't care if I never get back on the road. I like to think that I'm gonna do that. But if I don't, I can live with that.","I used to think that my songs were the best things that I would leave behind me. And I definitely think my kids are now. For starters, they're writing better songs than I was at their age.","I turned 30 as a janitor. I was thinking at the time that Hank Williams died when he was 29. All my peers were at least 10 years younger than I was. I felt like an old has-been at the time.","I remember having a lot of Josh White albums. Johnny Cash. Elvis. I loved the Coasters.","I grew up listening to Hank Williams and Johnny Cash, so arriving in Nashville in the '60s was really exciting for me.","When I was stationed in Germany, Johnny Cash was already a legend over there because he'd done some shows, then gone off to some bar straight afterwards and played just for the troops. So he was a real hero.","I watched Dylan record 'Blonde On Blonde' in my first week at work at CBS. It was just incredible.","Look at me! I can go from 'Donny and Marie' to Sam Peckinpah to Radio City Music Hall in one week.","If 'Bobby McGee' lasts, if 'Star Is Born' lasts, if 'Help Me Make It through the Night' lasts, if all of 'em last, man... who cares?","As far as fame, the everlasting fame thing. I used to think that was important for a writer... the desire to make your mark.","The most valuable thing to me seems to be time, and with time, I can be great. I have been... and I will be.","'Heaven's Gate' was based on a true story about the cattle people: the people who had the money turned on the settlers who were in the area. And it was mainly a defense of their behavior. And the cattlemen's association had just about declared war on these people who were poaching cattle, and because they were mainly immigrants.","They say the first thing to go is your legs, then it's your reflexes, then it's your friends.","There was time in the first half of the '80s when what I was saying on the stage was controversial. A lot of things I was talking about - Nicaragua and American foreign policy.","The first movie I was ever on was a Dennis Hopper film down in Peru.","I gave everything I ever wrote to Johnny Cash. I think he said later in some interview that he would take them home and throw them in the lake with all the other demos. I'm sure he got a million of them.","There's a time where people were out holding posters in protest outside shows I was doing, and thankfully, we've moved past that. And a lot of country stations wouldn't play me. They were more conservative than I was.","It's always embarrassing when somebody does something praiseworthy of you.","My old man worked for Pan American.","Every album I've made is about what I'm experiencing at the time.","Bobby Bare is one of the greatest people in country music.","My albums really are like scrapbooks to me.","I have no neighbors. I live in a small town where everybody is very protective of me.","Looking back, I'm surprised I had the nerve to do it, but I'm glad I did. Performing the songs and performing in film was just a part of my personality, just like football and boxing at one point in my life. I was able to lose myself in both of them, and that was a good feeling.","Right after I resigned from the Army in 1965, I flew helicopters for oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. I flew personnel from rig to rig, and I'd live on a platform out at sea.","To do the things that I did, I'm amazed that I had the audacity - like resigning from the Army and becoming a janitor and a songwriter.","I think it's kind of odd that 'This Old Road' was the first video I ever did. Because of all of the work I had done in films and everything, you'd think I would have done a video before that.","'This Old Road' somehow seems to get better the older you get.","I did co-write 'Moment of Forever' with Danny Timms. He wrote the melody, and I just did the words.","I've never really felt comfortable co-writing. I usually go at my own speed, you know.","Songs are just like your kids. You love them all, and they're all different. I can't really pick out favourites.","I ended up being friends with all my heroes. Lefty Frizzell, George Jones, Johnny Cash - it was incredible.","I've come to appreciate how special a song is compared to other art forms, because you can carry it around in your head and your heart, and it remains part of you. It just comes as natural as a bird to me, always did. It's the way singer-songwriters make sense of our lives.","I've tried to be more self-sufficient as I've gotten older. I'd like to not worry about whether they're going to sell my next album or book. Hell, William Blake wasn't even published in his lifetime.","Being in love with a lot of people is incompatible with a stable family life.","I've been trying to think of things to tell my kids, something that I could pass down, and it's like, gee whiz, I maybe never learned anything that didn't contradict itself.","The older I get, the less conservative I become."],"Kris Wu":["I don't want to follow in anyone's footsteps. I want to follow my own path and do something unique.","I think it's so important that you want to be in the room with these people making music together, because that's what it's all about. Especially hip-hop music, because you have to be vibing.","I'm super into their trench coats. I've been wearing them for a while. Even my mom, she loves them. Definitely working with Burberry is a dope collaboration, just a good opportunity.","You never know what's going to happen in the future.","I don't like social media at all, to be honest.","Toronto is obviously Drake city.","When they ask who is your biggest influence, I always say Pharrell: whether it is music or fashion, I'm a big fan.","I'm always up for challenges.","I really appreciate the opportunity to play on the All-Star court.","I want to thank the fans for supporting me.","I always wanted to be a youth influencer.","After I got into the industry, I got into fashion because before that, I wasn't really into fashion because I couldn't really afford anything. After, I got into this industry, and then I could start to afford them. I started to get into more of the high-fashion stuff.","All the sounds that I make, I want to make sure there are new stuff. I don't want to follow anyone's path or anything, I want to create my own sound.","I want people to look at me in the future and feel that there's this Asian hip-hop artist who's fresh and hot.","I love hip hop music and would do anything to help the culture blow up in China because it's been so underground. I just want people know how good this culture is, how good the music is, and how it can change your life.","You have to sacrifice sometimes. There are so many things in life you might want to do, but you have to know when to let go."],"Krist Novoselic":["Don't follow a trend. Follow your heart.","Sunshine Cake is just a fun hobby thing. That's about it.","If you've got a guitar and a lot of soul, just bang something out and mean it. You're the superstar.","We remember Kurt for what he was: caring, generous and sweet.","Let's keep the music with us. We'll always have it.","And Seattle isn't really crazy anymore. It's a big dot-com city.","But remember, guitar players are a dime a dozen.","But this is pretty new for me, both songwriting and singing.","But whenever history is in the making, there's some kind of intangible feeling.","I can't remember the last time I looked at a Nirvana web site.","I kind of discovered my voice for the first time, and the more I did it, the better it got.","I live out in the country now and it's quiet and it's a place where I can think a lot.","I think pot should be legalized, but I think the promotion of party culture is irresponsible.","I'm just really happy, because I think we're a great band, and I really like great bands.","Mike Watt and I had the same teacher. Mr. Tanaka.","No band is special, no player royalty.","Our idea is simply to play the songs and to emphasize our musicianship.","Theodore Roethke was a poet I was raised with so he has a lot of sentimental value for me.","I'm really into Sweet 75 right now, and I dig playing Nirvana, don't get me wrong. Even if Kurt never died, more than likely I'd be in Sweet 75 today still.","We asserted ourselves as a music community, and showed legislators that music is positive. Especially if you've sold 300 million records worldwide and pay taxes.","We're all players and musicians and we sure all get along good. We just clicked right off the bat. We started playing and then we almost immediately started recording.","But my role is to just apply the skills I've learned over the years: you listen to the guitar, you listen to the vocal melodies, you listen to the rhythm, and you come up with something that helps you take the song somewhere.","I don't know about the time those songs were written. But he was jamming with someone in Colorado or San Francisco, and I'm sure he was working on the lyrics right up to the show because they were really relevant for the situation.","I wanted to stimulate thought instead of throwing things out or try to give a perspective. I just put stuff up and it's up for two or three weeks and I get tired of it, so I take it down and put something else up.","It felt like being in the center of the world, and I felt like I was a witness to history and I knew that the whole world was watching on television. So, I could feel the collective consciousness of the world focused on this little strip of land called Seattle.","Just the other day I pulled out this old cassette of Ragged Glory and I popped it into my cassette player and I was digging it. They were just a great rock and roll band, one that presents the song ahead of everything else - there's no grand idea or concept behind it.","The only way you do anything is to become really active. And the most effective way to get your message to your elected representatives is to make campaign contributions and develop relationships with them.","This band is a real collaboration, and I'm greatful to anybody who can appreciate our music. It doesn't have to be a certain kind of fan or person or anything. I think there's a little bit of something for everybody on this record.","When I perform, I like to immerse myself in the music, and I just try to get off on the diversity of music."],"Krista Allen":["I want to clear up a few myths about myself. People have written that I was a kindergarten teacher and a former Miss Texas, and neither is true.","Life is too short not to do a little practical joking.","At a pool party, with everybody around, a guy and I had sex in the pool, but nobody knew it.","I love that men like to look at women, that they love sports, that they need to know the inner workings of mechanical objects. I love the whole makeup of men - that they never mature and are always just boys.","I think men are a beautiful creation.","I'm a firm believer that it's not the way you look or what you have, but what you've got inside.","Men are amazing. I love the way they are. They're consistently little boys, and they need to be nurtured and loved. But at the same time, they need to feel like men.","I love the whole makeup of men - that they never mature and are always just boys.","I put a lot of faith in dreams. I know that big movie roles and opportunities are going to happen.","I basically left Texas with no money. I was making $3.50 working in some mall, so I didn't have a lot of cash. I took $1,000 and headed to California. Along the way I stopped in Vegas because I had always wanted to see Caesar's Palace. So I stopped there and won $2,500 on a slot machine! It was amazing.","I just didn't know what the heck I wanted to do with my life, so I drove out to California and got really lucky.","I think there's an innocence to me.","It seems a little self-involved to be like, 'Oh, he's hitting on me.' Maybe he's just trying to start up an innocent conversation.","I don't ever really notice when guys are hitting on me. I'm oblivious."],"Krista Tippett":["Buddhist mindfulness is about the present, but I also think it's about being real. Being awake to everything. Feeling like nothing can hurt you if you can look it straight on.","Depression can kill you. It can also be a spiritually enriching experience. It's really an important part of my theology now and my spirituality that life is not perfect, and I grew up wanting it to be and thinking that if it wasn't, I could make it that way, and I had to acknowledge that I had all kinds of flaws and sadnesses and problems.","Structure is something that calms our nature; we know this of toddlers.","I like to say that I'm tracing the intersection between big ideas and human experience, between theology and real life.","I don't accept the idea that there are two sides to any issue. I think that the middle ground is to be found within most of us.","Tolerance is not really a lived virtue; it's more of a cerebral ascent.","Kindness is an everyday byproduct of all the great virtues.","If God is God, we can't be afraid of what we can learn.","You are not going to be perfect every day. It's about turning up the next day and doing it again.","What a liberating thing to realize that our problems are probably our richest sources for rising to the ultimate virtue of compassion.","Intelligence alone does not get us where we need to go or even necessarily where we want to go. For that, the human creature must exercise harder-won capacities of wisdom, and wise action.","Strong religious identities survive and thrive. But more than ever before, even in their most conservative iterations, they are chosen.","For many people who were never religious or who leave the religion of their childhood behind, it's the experience of having children of your own that brings an urgency to the question of what you believe.","I had been a journalist in Europe and then went to divinity school in the early 1990s, and came out as somebody who had the perspective of a journalist and was now also theologically educated.","I make no apologies for the fact that I have a religious life of my own. I'm speaking as a Christian because I'm speaking as myself.","My depression is not something very special. A lot of people go through depression. My divorce is not something very special; a lot of people go through divorce.","If we can't face our losses, we can't be present either fully to everything that is. When people have cut off or not made peace with some part of themselves, they miss out on other aspects of life.","Mystery is a birthright of theology and faith, but you often do find religious people grasping for answers that shut things down and narrow what is possible.","One of the things I reject in our cultural divisions is the clash between faith and reason, and I would say the same about mystery and intellect. They are somehow mysteriously akin to each other.","Being intellectually hospitable is a virtue that I bring into the interview space.","Fear usually looks like anger."],"Kristan Higgins":["It's hard to stop loving someone on cue, especially when he's still so kind and loving toward you.","I think self-doubt, as grim as it can be, makes me a better writer. Stasis and hubris would probably be the death knell for my career.","Humor writing is something that comes naturally to me.","Humor writing requires a rhythm and timing, as well as some kind of connection to the reader, and I think that's how I tap into it.","My love of cleaning is symbolic of my desire to rule the world... I always wear a seat belt because I enjoy being alive... and I like having two eyes, so yes to the safety goggles, too!","Sometimes, I'll hear from other writers or folks in the publishing industry that my books are rule-breakers, which I take as a compliment.","I do think people should be proud and supportive of their friends, in publishing and everywhere else.","Honestly, my entire childhood could be summed up with one word: Reader. I was always hunched over a book; in fact, I was the only kid in the world who got paler in the summer, because I'd sneak down into our cool, dank cellar and sit alone with a book for hours.","After about the age of 13, I was a romance addict. Still am, though I read just about every other genre as well. The only thing I really shy away from is political thrillers.","I guess my ambition is simply to keep doing what I'm doing for as long as I can.","I think writing well takes a little bit of talent and an awful lot of work.","A lot of people ask for sequels, but what they really want is just to know the characters are happy and safe.","I took piano lessons as a kid, and my daughter's played piano since before she started kindergarten, so classical piano is something I really love.","You know what I loved about 'Sideways'? Well, the wine, of course. But it was one of the few movies in which being a writer was realistically depicted. I loved how the Paul Giamatti character tries so ineptly to talk about his book.","One thing about 'Thelma & Louise' we can't forget: Brad Pitt. Oh, yes.","There's something so satisfying about road trip movies - and books!","An entire empire built on teenage angst, yes? Thank you, John Hughes!","I think it's always interesting to learn what the seemingly spontaneous one-nighter actually reveals about a character."],"Kristanna Loken":["Playing a robot is possibly the most difficult role you can have as an actor, because you have to take all your innate emotional responses and completely suppress them. Even the way you walk is affected.","Believe in and follow your dreams.","I would definitely like to have a family, and whether that's with a man or a woman doesn't really matter to me. I've already got my friend who's going to be the donor, so that's taken care of. Just give me a few years and we'll go from there.","I just try to take it as it comes. One autograph at a time.","I always try to make myself be very approachable and easy to talk to, so hopefully people will feel that they can approach me.","I connect with an aura, with energy. And if the person with whom I connect happens to be a female, that's just the way it is.","I worked with a mime coach. I did weapons training. I did weight training.","I think that you have to present an image that is... true to you, and... the way you would like to be perceived, so I think that through the years I've worked really hard at trying to create an image that is true to me.","I definitely felt that I was put at a very high place to be able to be a part of such a wonderful franchise in cinema history, so I was definitely very driven at doing a great job and having my body look the way it should and just being a part of the creative process.","I'd like to do something a little different. Something a little less intense. I'm not sure what it's going to be yet. For the first time in my life, it's great to have choices, but I think I have to be very careful in choosing the right next project.","People were actually approaching me on the street and thinking that I was an athlete. They couldn't quite place it, but a runner, or swimmer or something.","Your body has such a memory.","I started acting when I was 13 in New York. Worked there for a couple years, then auditioned for a show there that was going to be filming here. Ended up coming out, getting the job and just staying.","I think I can try the film world out for a while.","I'd like to go to Brazil I think. Do a little South America trip.","I can appreciate anybody's passion for anything.","I don't have a dishwasher, and I hate washing dishes.","I never really was much of a practical jokester or anything.","Acting is what I've pursued since I was a child.","I'm almost six feet tall and have a deep voice. People never knew how to cast me."],"Kristaps Porzingis":["I believe whenever you're winning and doing the right thing, you're stats will be fine, and everything else will come in place.","I always try to stay aggressive. I always use my strengths and always work on my weaknesses to get better. That's just who I am.","I would like to dunk on Shaq.","One thing as a leader - you don't say something to say something. When you actually see something and need to talk to a guy, that's when you say it. It will come naturally.","Us three brothers - me, Janis, and Martins - we made a bet. We all sat down and said we were going to grow our hair out. But after a month or two, they cut their hair. But I was too young to make the decision about whether I would get a haircut, so mine just kept growing. And it was so long that I decided I should start rocking those cornrows.","I'm really focused on getting better as a player.","I love the triangle. It's a great offense if you execute it well.","Believe it or not, I've never been on the subway.","It's not a good feeling when you get booed. But I don't want to be good because somebody booed me. I want to be great player because that's the way I am.","For the triangle to really work, everybody needs to be on the same page and know how to play it.","Low ceilings, low doors. I hate that. Oh my God, it's the worst. This world is too small for me.","Until that moment comes when the ball comes to me every time, I have to find a way to be effective with offensive rebounds, play hard defense, blocking shots.","I like the triangle. My first season, the whole first season, we played nothing but the triangle, so I know it pretty well.","It's tough to find time to get rest.","I love New York.","No one's comfortable with losing.","A good team needs time to play together.","Nobody wants to be losing, especially in New York. It's extremely tough. That's how it is.","I'll keep growing as a player, keep working out, trying to become what I want to become.","I learned English from watching American movies and American series. And you'd watch the movie the first time and not understand anything. Then you'd watch it again, and you'd start understanding more and more, and that's how I learned English.","I have 'Friday.' I have 'Dinner For Schmucks.' And I have 'John Wick.' There are others too I can't think of now, but those are my go-to movies.","I love Barcelona. Barcelona is a very, very nice city.","I love playing ping pong.","I try to eat as healthy as possible and try to put some weight on.","I loved the Lakers in '09 and 2010. I used to get up early with my brother Janis, and we watched them win the titles.","You always gotta find a little bit of time for the girls, right?","One day, I'd like to get a quadruple double, points, assists, rebounds and blocks.","I know my game. I know what I need to get better at and be better at.","The only thing I focus on is just winning. Once we win, everyone remembers a winner. That's what I'm focused on.","Before I got to the NBA, I always flew coach - it was the worst time of my life. I remember being 14 or 15, and it was such a struggle to fit into those seats.","I knew there were going to be boos if the Knicks drafted me. That's how New York fans are.","I know if I play hard and show that I want to be a Knick, I know the fans will accept me.","I really wanted to get drafted by the Knicks, and it was a dream come true. I wasn't even hearing the boos that night. I was just having a special moment with my family, hugging them.","New York City is crazy; there are people everywhere. New York is the best city in the world, I think. You have everything there.","You need a long-term coach to be able to win.","If we can win games, it doesn't matter who is scoring.","When I have difficulties, I will not complain.","If we're winning, that's all that matters to me. If we're winning, I'll be happy. And that can help me grow.","Playing in New York, there's a lot of pressure, but me and some Europeans like the pressure.","I think American fans, they know more college guys than guys overseas.","I want to be a part of this organization, and I know the fans are a little harsh sometimes, but that's how it is here in New York, and I'm ready for it.","I think Carmelo is a great player. He makes players around him better. Whatever thing, whatever Carmelo wants me to do, I will do that out on the court just to prove that I'm worthy enough to be on the court with him, starting with the dirty jobs - just getting rebounds, getting shots, getting blocks, and just running the court.","I heard New York fans and people in New York are hard-working fans, so they want to see players work hard on the court. That's the first thing I've got to do.","The first day I got drafted, I felt the fans were really passionate about basketball, and there was going to be a lot of pressure.","My older brothers, they know how to keep my head straight and be thinking about what I need to do on the court. Now I have that in me, that mentality, that I want to get better and better every game. Thanks to them, they showed me the way.","The fans will talk about whatever. But when you're not doing your best, you're losing, you can't let all that get to your head. You focus and try to play hard. The fans, they will respect you for that.","With my height, I probably wouldn't be able to make money playing pingpong, but I would just have fun with it. The table is too low for me.","New Yorkers aren't that friendly, but they're still pretty friendly, and they're hardworking, passionate people.","That's one thing about Americans: They know how to have fun.","As a kid, I used to love roller coasters. I love adrenaline, love going faster.","I pick up languages fast.","That's something that I gotta prove - I don't like being labeled as 'soft.' I'm not soft.","I learned Spanish in five or six months.","I'm a good student. Just trying to learn as much as possible is how I picked up so many languages.","I want to be in such a basketball city like New York.","I'm a student of the game.","I will try to make my career as long as possible. For me, it's not about money, so I just love playing the game.","The first year was kind of hard for me. There was just too much attention, too much going on, and I really just wanted to focus on basketball.","I have to do a better job of picking the spots where I want to attack and picking the right moment when I need to attack.","I think that's the type of game I'm better at - faster paced, just moving the ball more around.","I want to have a long career in the NBA. First, I want to be an All-Star, and hopefully one day I can win a ring with the New York Knicks.","Don't worry about me; my moment will come. I'll be ready for it. I will work hard, and whenever it's gonna come, whenever the coaches are gonna trust me, I'm gonna be on court and give 100 percent.","Of course the defenders are trying to be physical with me. They look at me, 7-3, skinny, they try to be physical.","At the end of the day the thing I want most of all is winning.","We knew the European players that went to the NBA and had great careers, and we knew the ones that went and had terrible careers or finished early. We were prepared for a lot of criticism.","I don't love the off-court stuff. But I know it's necessary.","When I was eighteen and I won the European Championship - that's when I realized I had an opportunity to play in the NBA one day.","It's a dream come true for me to be an idol for those kids. One little moment from my life that I spend with that kid, he might remember that for the rest of his life, that he met me that day when he was 10 years old.","I listen to a lot of Drake and Meek Mill before games.","Maybe in Latvian one day I'll rap a little bit, but definitely not in English.","We're a basketball family.","Some girls are intimidated by my height, obviously. But a lot of girls do like it, so that's cool.","I just really love the game. I'm very hungry, and I'm looking forward to playing in the best league in the world.","When I'm playing in a close game, I'm out on the floor only trying to help the team win.","I'm adding moves to my post game. I'm really working on staying low. I'm working on my strength overall, especially my legs. That's going to help me defensively as well.","I'm never really happy with anything I do.","My quiet place is in the gym. When I feel like going to church, it's for me the MSG training facility and working on my game.","Basketball is pretty big in Latvia.","You can never really relax until you've signed that contract with your team.","I've got that European swagger.","I just like boxing.","Whatever people want to call me, I'm cool with, except 'Zinger.'","A coach I had in Spain, Scott Roth, he used to call me Zinger. He would yell at me all the time, 'Zinger!' It's just stuck in my head that I don't like that name."],"Kristen Bell":["I have the best roommates in the world! It creates a fun sense of family... and that's really important to me. Things can get so lonely without it.","I'm not homely enough to play the nerdy girl and not nearly pretty enough to play the pretty girl.","I have always been an animal lover. I had a hard time disassociating the animals I cuddled with - dogs and cats, for example - from the animals on my plate, and I never really cared for the taste of meat. I always loved my Brussels sprouts.","I'm not a risk taker. I don't do plunging necklines or really short skirts. I try to stay as classy as possible and provide a little mystery.","When I see something unjust, I have to intervene - it's hard for me to watch the underdog suffer.","There are so few strong roles for women, especially young women. And Veronica is very serious but also very likable. She's a lone wolf, and it appeals to people that she isn't rich and doesn't have a lot of friends. No posse. She's just like you, like most of us.","I'm very used to playing the tomboy or the sarcastic cynic. That's my go-to. Playing the vulnerable of a real girl that's in real womanlike situations, where it's romanticized, I'm a little nervous about it.","What was previously perceived as nerdy is now viewed as original. What I like about nerdiness, geekiness, is it doesn't really matter what you're into - it just means you're not a follower.","All girls hit that phase where they like the bad boy. I grew out of that really young and I have a wonderful guy in my life who's not a bad boy at all. I like the satiric, consistent nice guy.","This is not to be cocky, but, I go over real well at Comic-Con. I've done quite a few Comic-Cons, and I enjoy the hell out of them. They are so much fun, and so bizarre. I've done the FX Show in Florida, Wizard-World in Chicago, Comic-Con in San Diego, Wonder-Con in San Francisco, the Comic-Con in New York, and I've done them numerous times.","I pushed myself way too hard during the first year of Veronica Mars and I got moody and run-down. Now I'll go to bed early instead of going out with friends. It's not always the most fun option, but I know I need at least eight hours of sleep to feel balanced.","I've always been a serial monogamist.","I have the mouth of a sailor.","I'm a geek who loves fashion. There's been a reinvention of the word geek. It means being passionate about anything that's under the radar or sort of frowned upon, like Comic-Con.","I have friends who wear Star Wars costumes and act like the characters all day. I may not be that deep into it, but there's something great about loving what you love and not caring if it's unpopular.","I don't want to be pigeonholed into doing just romantic comedies. But they're fun, and especially for women, it's nice to go to see them and enjoy that breath of fresh air.","I'm carded for R-rated movies. And I get talked down to a lot. When I try to go rent a car or buy an airplane ticket or other stuff adults do, I get 'Okaaaaaay, honey.' I remember when I was 18, getting crayons in a restaurant.","I'm empathetic to a fault. I really do - embarrassingly enough - tear up when someone squishes a bug in front of me.","I'm not recognized very often, and if I am, it's a die-hard Veronica Mars fan. Which is usually flattering and an honor. I really try not to think about it.","I've got more junk in the trunk than most 5-foot-1 blonde girls, and I like it.","Detroit, the heart of the country... I grew up on 10 Mile, 2 miles better than 8 Mile.","I love nerds. Comic-Con junkies are the tastemakers of tomorrow. Isn't that funny? The tables have turned.","I don't like staying in hotels. I like to be in my own bed. San Diego as a city is really awesome. The only hard part of it for me is that I'm away from my family and my house. But as far as shooting down there, we get amazing locations, and the crew is really, really stellar down there. They are really fun.","I'm not in the business of becoming famous. And that's the advice I give to younger aspiring actors. Work onstage and do the little roles. In the end it's not important to be seen. It's important to do. There's a lot of disappointment in this business, but my family keeps me grounded.","I can rock out anything. I mean, I can rock out a little 'Time After Time'. I can do a little 'Grease Lightning'. It depends on the mood, but we do go karaoke, my friends and I in Los Angeles, and it's a lot of fun.","I loved Veronica right off the bat. She was so strong and I think it is so important because there are so few shows that portray women, especially young women, as being strong and being able to stand up for themselves.","I rarely wear clothes when I'm home by myself. I love making breakfast naked. But you've got to make sure the gardener's not coming that day.","I'm an awful driver. I'm not going to lie about it. I'm not a good driver. I tried for a long time to pretend that I was. There's a lot of road rage and a lot of times it's directed at something I've done on the road.","I've been very lucky in the characters I've chosen. Up until last year I was a nobody. I did jobs I booked because I needed to put food in my mouth.","I loved Catholic school. I didn't like being beeped at by old pervs at the gas station because I was wearing a plaid skirt, though. It's like, do you think I'm going to stop and give you my phone number?","Something magical happened when I turned 25 - I looked in the mirror and was like, 'You might not get carded for an R-rated movie anymore.' Like I didn't have a little stick figure anymore.","I'm more of a homebody. I'm constantly asked: 'Why don't we see you out?' But that's not what drives me. I prefer to have people over - which I do a lot, because I bought a house that's way too big for me, and four of my friends live there.","I'm not going to become anybody I don't want to become.","I find it almost comforting to count calories, because it makes me conscious of what I'm eating. But on Super Bowl Sunday, I thought, 'Surrender to it. It's nacho time.' Then I ate nothing but Doritos all day.","Every woman in her late 20s goes through a period where she just doesn't believe love is out there anymore, but it is. And I think the minute you stop looking for it is when it comes for you."],"Kristen Connolly":["Hair and make-up people don't get enough credit for what they do. It's not just making people look good. It's really creating the character.","Everyone has dated or been with a person who is obsessed with their work, and it's immensely frustrating.","A lot of auditions are not fun; they're just a necessary evil, and, if you're lucky, you have a few moments that are fun.","I went to Yale's drama school for theater, so we did tons of Shakespeare; then, I got out of school and said, 'OK, it will be Shakespeare,' and it was like, 'Or, it will be commercials and soaps.'"],"Kristen Johnston":["I don't consider myself a goody-goody, but I like to be perceived as classy.","I like people-watching and fading into crowds.","And to be different is great. You don't want to be the same.","Onstage, I was never the ingenue.","To actually be allowed to be beautiful is a total first for me.","I really came out to L.A. to take the money and run.","I was such a dork. I was too big. I was really gangly.","It was only when I moved to New York that I realized tall is good.","I was voted Biggest Ham and Likeliest to Become a Celebrity.","My way was not to be the petite, gorgeous, little cheerleader. My way of getting by was making people laugh.","May I say, if you were suddenly put into a woman's body, wouldn't you be slightly interested in your breasts, and why people look at certain parts of you, and why certain parts move like they do?","I was a full foot taller than any child my age.","I literally felt like a freak, which is another aspect of the role of Sally that I relate to: total outsider.","But this show reminds me that there are other aspects to me besides the fact that I'm a funny chick.","I'd so much rather people think I was funny than pretty.","I spent 10 years in New York doing theater.","I was born in Washington, D.C., and I was raised in Milwaukee.","I'm a strong person, but I'd never resort to violence.","If you love it, and work really hard at it, it will really happen, I believe. I'm living proof.","I've always just gone with the best role, and I don't care if it's in theater, film or television.","When you're that tall, people talk about it all the time.","I think Janeane Garofalo is incredibly funny, and I love Dennis Miller.","I want to play a Disney villainess so badly.","I am, uh... a 6 foot tall woman, I feel like I'm a healthy size, I'm not anorexic; and I feel that people who aren't anorexic are punished... for not being anorexic."],"Kristen Renton":["I love playing the bad girl.","Any woman that is willing to take control of their life and do what they want to do to make their living, I have a lot of respect for.","I feel like any time you, as an actor, can be surrounded by other amazing actors, you can't do anything but grow.","I would never steal another woman's man."],"Kristen Schaal":["Sarcasm doesn't read sarcastic in print.","I think growing up on a farm in a certain amount of isolation, with not a lot of friends nearby, makes you entertain yourself and kind of grows your imagination - being alone is quite good for all that. You make up stories, talk to the animals, let them be an audience, a bunch of cows.","I think it's great training for any comedian to start on cows. Because with cows, you expect them to be bored and just stare at you blankly. And that's exactly what you'll get at a comedy club. If you can toughen up with a cow audience, then you'll never be worried with a human audience.","I would like to be known as someone who was really sweet but also knowledgeable in all areas of life.","Animals in general have sparked a weird depression in me, because as much as I tried, I couldn't layer a personality over them. You know what I mean? I would stare at the cows, and I would sing to the cows, and they would always just look at me blankly.","I love the idea that I have the power to look for the projects I can put myself into, but I'm still at that level of just being happy to have a job.","I think I've always had a disconnect from what I'm supposed to be like.","No one knows who the real me is, so I can be a hundred different kinds of me.","My parents are pretty religious, devout, but did they force it on me? No, I don't think so. I still think of myself as a Lutheran, just one who doesn't go to church.","I thought I would either be an epidemiologist or a 'Price Is Right' model.","Sometimes I try to sell shows with a female lead to networks, and that isn't something that's been a proven formula for them, so they reject it. I do feel like men get the funniest roles in movies.","In high school, I was doing a skit for forensics and people started laughing, more than I was prepared to deal with. It was a surprise.","I would be an actress for the rest of my life just because it's really relaxing. Writing is hard work, and stand-up is so stressful before you get on stage, but acting is a complete ensemble experience.","I'm not really a control person, and I'm a big believer in collaboration. I like to have a friend.","My style can't be held within a pixel medium. Like, it needs to be performed in a living, breathing space. People need to have all their senses ready to take on my comedy, and unfortunately, TV alienates at least their sense of touch, taste, smell.","I definitely had a Paul Rudd crush. He's great.","I loved 'Burning Love,' and I really do love almost everything Paul Scheer touches.","I don't enjoy reality television at all. I have to say that I get it, though. I watch some of it, and I understand why people enjoy it.","'Rock of Love' with Bret Michaels was fun. He's a lovable guy.","I've been lucky. The projects I've gotten to work on are projects I'd want to watch myself. That's what I try to shoot for.","I just really like people, and being a freelancer can be lonely during the day, when you're at home trying to write anything you can. 'Flight Of The Conchords' was so wonderful because I had a family for two years.","My sensibilities are like, 'I want it to be weirder.'","I never really saw myself as a standup comedian. I always just thought of myself as someone who used the eight minutes or 10 minutes she was allotted and had a blast.","I definitely do weird things every show.","You go from nobody looking at you to people taking second looks. I remember really loving it - and then feeling so guilty for loving it. Like, 'That's gross, Kristen.' Also, telling myself it could go away at any moment, and I'd be so sad.","I used to go to open mics in New York when I was starting out, and it was mostly just people who wanted an audience to look at them for eight minutes on a stage.","Being a correspondent on 'The Daily Show' is some combination of doing a character and doing stand-up. It's a juggling act to find a balance between being you and playing a role.","It's not hard to be a woman in comedy as long as you're also a writer. You have to create your opportunity.","The more women sit down and write something in a woman's voice for a woman, they more you'll see women in comedy because gender doesn't define sense of humor. Imagination and intelligence and perspective do.","I would love for people to know that the label 'feminist' is something that everyone should wear proudly, because it just means that you support women.","Most of the people I know in comedy are not weird or messed up.","Bad improv happens with people who are inexperienced with each other and don't know the craft that well. But bad stand-up is something that could happen to someone at any level in their career.","I would never bring a kid to a comedy show myself, but I have noticed that I can't stop other people from bringing their kids.","I probably shouldn't say this about all animals, but at least the farm animals that I've hung out with, and even when I go to the zoo usually, they're like a blank slate. I guess that's why I like them. They're puppets, and you can imagine them being anything you want.","In the U.K., there's absolutely no money for television. So you can do pretty much whatever you want. They're not losing money on any of the shows, so they'll give you a lot of creative freedom. In the United States, there are millions and millions of dollars at stake, so they need a sure formula."],"Kristen Soltis Anderson":["The robots are coming, whether we like it or not, and will change our economy in dramatic ways.","For thousands of years, humans have used the art of storytelling to motivate and persuade.","A compelling story requires conflict, friction, an obstacle to be overcome.","Thoughtful education programs and access to effective forms of contraception are key to preventing unplanned pregnancy.","There is nothing just or fair about what happened to Jordan Edwards. And his story is yet another in a long line of tragedies that now powerfully remind us of the long way we still have to go in creating a fair and just relationship between law enforcement, our criminal justice system, and the public our laws are supposed to protect.","It's not hard to assume that voters do not have deeply considered views on each and every policy issue before them but instead, perhaps, have one or two strongly held views and then allow their favored political leaders to fill in the gaps on the rest of the issues.","My dad is an electrical engineer. So he was always very focused on, you know, teaching his daughters about, you know, science, math, technology. None of us actually became engineers for our careers, but I always had that exposure when I was young, and I just loved playing computer games.","After Mitt Romney's defeat, the RNC released its official assessment of what happened - a failure to reach younger voters, nonwhite voters, women - but was met with a counter-narrative that, in fact, it was Romney's failure to be conservative enough that led to a depressed Republican base.","Electing Democrats means nothing happens. Elect Republicans, and at least there's a chance.","In 2012, when Mitt Romney named Russia as our greatest geopolitical foe, Democrats scoffed and accused Republicans of trying to ignite a new Cold War.","Women want fair taxes, a growing economy, affordable health care, secure borders, and the defeat of ISIS. They don't need the solutions to be wrapped in pink. They just want problems solved.","There's a lot of work to be done in the polling world, and a need to continue to rethink how we do what we do. We also need to be more open to the idea that any one input - in this case, polls - may not be the only way to hear what people are saying.","The idea that someone, somewhere will campaign in a positive, uplifting way on an agenda that can inspire Americans? I'm sadly done holding my breath.","Polling is an art as well as a science, and the art of crafting good questions is still vital.","I think 'Candy Crush' may be fading in popularity, but there's always something new that's popping up.","Lots of folks still do watch TV, but I think understanding the future of politics means understanding where folks' attention is being paid and delivering your message and your ideas in that space.","It was weird that I was a young person who was Republican. And I wanted to get at the heart of why it was that so many people of my generation thought that being Republican just wasn't for them. They thought that conservative ideas just weren't for them.","I grew up in Orlando, Florida, and I joined the debate team right around the time of the 2000 election.","I had a history teacher who taught us a lot about the Cold War. You had these examples of countries where the government had tried to manage the economy really intensely, and it ended up being bad for the citizens there. I found myself beginning to lean more right on economic issues.","I dreamed of being like Sam Seaborn on 'The West Wing'.","I went to Washington, D.C, for the first time my senior year as part of Girls Nation, put on by the American Legion Auxiliary, which sends high school students to D.C. to form a pretend federal government. There was an energy about the city that made me feel like I just had to come back there.","For federal races, being able to carefully navigate the Trump Era is a significant challenge.","President Trump is right about at least one thing: No matter what he does, America cannot stop talking about him.","One thing that is fairly undeniable about Trump - love him or loathe him - is his understanding of how to manipulate the media and to perpetuate a symbiotic relationship with the press.","In 2014, topics like Black Lives Matter, the Middle East, and Ebola were prominent in the national discussion, with mentions of then-President Barack Obama making up a relatively small slice of the discussion on news twitter.","Even when we're not talking about Trump, we're talking about Trump.","It is fair to debate how much either bill - Obamacare in 2010, tax reform in 2018 - had or will have an impact on the midterms.","Obamacare itself did not become popular until the middle of 2017, when the risk of repeal was the greatest; for the bulk of 2010 after passage, it was unpopular by double-digit margins.","Federalists, Whigs, Democratic-Republicans; parties are born, parties die, and parties realign themselves to adapt to shifting demographics and attitudes.","After the 2012 election, 'independent' becomes the popular choice among new young voters and stays that way with the exception of a brief spike around the 2016 Democratic primary fight.","I have written time and again about the damage the Republican Party has done to itself with the millennial generation.","The American system is set up to have two parties competing for votes. But Americans have not had the same two parties to choose from since the beginning.","If a woman rising in power is too tough or aggressive, she's attacked for it. If she's attractive, she's accused of having used that to her advantage. And even if a woman is beyond qualified for a role, there will always be those who raise doubts about if she's really qualified.","When talented, qualified women take on greater responsibility, the simple fact of being talented and qualified is hardly enough to shield them from the gender-specific animosity that will come their way.","Election losses are always an inkblot test for partisans. If a candidate's defeat has no clear and obvious cause, if the data points are all over the map, it is easy for those on the sidelines to claim, 'Candidate X would have won if only he or she had been more like... me.'","Without a clear diagnosis of why the candidate or party failed, there can be no clear consensus about how to move forward.","Trump won 44.4 percent of votes in Virginia in 2016. At press time, Ed Gillespie had won 45 percent of the vote in 2017.","In the United States, it is unmistakable that young people have broken away from the political right and have gravitated to more leftist-populist figures like Bernie Sanders.","With an economy that is going strong and a belief that tomorrow will be better than today, it may be easier to just shrug it off if, say, an internet service you use like WhatsApp gets turned off by the government as the Communist Party's national congress approaches.","Those who are able to afford to live in a neighborhood with 'good schools' will do so, knowing that a good education is the key to good opportunity for their children.","Millennials easily connect the dots between good education and good opportunities, and they also understand that it isn't just hard work that determines how well a child will be educated - it also depends on where they live and the resources their parents commit to their education.","Often times, when we talk about improving our public schools, it is easy to come back to the question of money. Are schools basically fine, just underfunded? Millennials say no - more funding isn't the cure-all for what ails our schools.","Millennials are not deeply familiar with school choice, and have some reservations, especially about the types of institutions that a student might choose to attend with taxpayer dollars.","Republicans can't always agree on where to cut spending. They certainly can't agree on what to do about entitlements. There isn't a unified foreign policy vision, and there's no consensus on immigration reform.","If there is one issue where one could justifiably assume that Republicans are all in agreement, it is on lowering taxes.","Congress has been productive when focusing on bites of policy that don't inflame the divisions within the party and quietly do the work of governing.","The reality is that the Republican Party may have unified government but is not unified enough on many major signature policy areas.","Either people are changing their minds about Trump, or increasing numbers of his supporters are deciding it is too embarrassing to admit they support him. Neither is a particularly good position to be in.","The data - on issues and on Trump himself - keep pointing back to 'one-in-four' as the true size of Trump's base. It is around one in four who like the tweeting, like the insults, the things other people say are mean or unproductive behavior.","Washington in the summer is a never-ending stream of tour groups and packs of students, here to swarm the monuments, stroll the National Mall, and learn about our nation's history and government.","Not long ago, women in Afghanistan were required by Taliban leadership to be covered nearly head-to-toe and were barely allowed to leave the home; that young Afghan women today are not only accessing an education but are able to meet young people from around the world and cheer on a robot of their own making is something beautiful.","Overall, America's math scores on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) have risen since the 1990s though remain disappointing when compared to the rest of the globe.","Boosting STEM education opportunities for young women globally is one critical way that the U.S. can promote women's equality, as well as economic development, around the world.","In 2010, voters certainly hit the brakes on the Obama presidency. Fast forward to the 2016 election, where voters yanked up on the emergency brake and did a donut in the parking lot. Now, the car has stopped. We sit here dizzy for a moment, looking to get on the road again.","There's no question that a Democratic Congress plus a Trump presidency would equal gridlock. Nothing moves, nothing changes, nothing gets accomplished, nothing gets reformed. Voters know this.","There are certainly more Republicans who like President Trump than like 'Republicans in Congress,' and certainly many Republicans who already feel like their own Congress is a brake pedal of its own.","There's no counting the number of times the media have asked, 'Will this be the thing that drives Donald Trump's supporters away from him? Is this finally the time?'","Obama's numbers fell by a slightly larger amount over his first few months because he enjoyed much more support right at the start from Republicans, support that eroded quickly.","'Staunch conservatives' and 'free marketeers' are fairly typical Republicans, while the 'American preservationists' are far less reliably a part of a GOP coalition.","The things that frustrate one piece of Trump's coalition often endear him to or embolden another wing of the coalition.","Candidates, of course, often claim that they want to run 'a purely positive campaign,' but this rarely materializes.","Tax reform exists, sort of, as an outline - miles away from being actual passed legislation.","In the relatively short time frame of December 2015 to March 2017, nearly half of all young Republicans left their party at some point, with roughly a quarter bidding the GOP adieu for good.","Let's think about where things stood in December 2015. By that time, Republicans had already had such epic and long-standing struggles with young people that I'd written a whole book about it. Additionally, Republicans had already had a bruising start to their primary season.","What is a fair way to structure our economy? To handle those who did not come to America legally? To distribute scarce public resources and benefits?","President Trump rightly points out that law enforcement is mostly made up of good people putting themselves in harm's way to protect us. He lauds the men and women in blue and often talks about the need to make it easier for the cops to do their jobs.","Donald Trump has had political success positioning himself as a 'law-and-order' candidate.","On paper, Emmanuel Macron should be a candidate tailor-made for young voters. He himself is young. He pushes for more entrepreneurship, modernization, and a loosening of regulations that prevent young workers from working as they please when they please.","When polled on Donald Trump's agenda, though pluralities of young people oppose his policies on immigration and healthcare, there is one issue where Trump's position wins outright majority support, even among young Democrats: trade.","I do not think it is a coincidence that young people gravitated toward populist voices in the French election and that the two issue positions where Donald Trump and young voters seem to agree most - global engagement and trade - are rooted in populism.","Young voters may be growing up in an era of increased global connection, cooperation and commerce. But they're very open to politicians who tell them it is these very things that are keeping elites in power and keeping their generation down.","Breaking dramatically with Bush-era Republican orthodoxy, Trump ran on a message of 'America First' and of avoiding spending blood and treasure on adventures overseas.","Political science has long tried to tackle a fundamental question of voter behavior: Do voters choose politicians because those politicians hold views that they like, or do voters choose policy positions because the politicians they like say those positions are correct?","Fast-moving views are not likely to be strongly held views. Instead, they're much more likely to be about people mirroring back the signals they see coming from the leaders they support. People can resolve dissonance by shifting their own view on issues that aren't top of mind.","In the year 2000, the very youngest members of the Baby Boomer crew were in their mid-30s while the oldest Boomers were mid-50s. That year, the Boomers were a generation divided somewhat equally between the GOP and Democrats.","When the oldest batch of millennials really first began voting around the mid-2000s, they leaned a little toward the Democrats, looking a lot like the Gen Xers also did at that time.","Major realigning events can reshape coalitions and change how large groups of people view politics, policy, and the parties.","Maybe President Trump will turn out to be a fabulously successful president who will endear the millennial generation to the Right anew."],"Kristen Stewart":["Really, I'm incredibly disjointed and not candid. Just in general, my thoughts tend to come out in little spurts that don't necessarily connect. If you hang around long enough, you can find the linear path. But it will take a second. That is why these interviews never go well for me.","I am quite shy and people think I'm aloof.","The strangest part about being famous is you don't get to give first impressions anymore. Everyone already has an impression of you before you meet them.","It's okay', you know? It's okay to be you. It's okay to just not be okay. It's okay to not be okay.","I have really bad luck with my thumbs. It plagues me, actually. It drives me crazy! Both of them are very oddly shaped.","Success is always something completely different to people. I feel like I've succeeded, if I'm doing something that makes me happy and I'm not lying to anybody.","I go outside, and I'm wearing a funky T-shirt and my hair is dirty, and people say, 'What's wrong with her? She needs to invest in a hairbrush.'","I don't want to make movies for kids, and I don't want to make movies for adults either.","Success is always something completely different to people. I feel like I've succeeded, if I'm doing something that makes me happy and I'm not lying to anybody. I'm not doing that now, so I feel really good about myself.","You have to be OK with your own fears. If you're an honest person, you'll make mistakes, but that's when the most interesting things happen.","I like making pies. I have a bunch of fruit trees in my backyard. My loquat tree sprouted, and I like making loquat pie. They're really hard to peel and everything, and it took me forever, but they make the best pies. They're amazing.","But, I'm kind of a control freak. I get really freaked out if I don't know what's going on and what's going to happen.","Despite what people think, I was such a rule follower at school.","I want to go to college. I'm going to take four years off. I don't want to miss that. I want to be a writer. I think that'd be awesome.","I do want to work on writing, because writing's a skill. Writing is something that you can train yourself to know better. To know yourself better. And it's intimidating as hell.","What you don't see are the cameras shoved in my face and the bizarre intrusive questions being asked, or the people falling over themselves, screaming and taunting to get a reaction.","I'm not ready to get married, but I have a pretty great family and I'd like that too, someday.","It doesn't matter if you're doing a studio movie or you're doing an independent movie. When you get to set and you're doing a scene, it's always going to be the same job. I really don't think about my career, in terms of planning it out and what this does for me.","I think I'm a bit less inhibited, and not thinking too much before speaking. It's not about being shameful, I'm just a bit more unabashedly myself because of this thing, and it probably started at age 15. I can be around people and say what I think without fear.","I think romance is anything honest. As long as it's honest, it's so disarming.","Girls are scary. Large groups of girls scare the crap out of me.","I'm really proud of Twilight. I think it's a good movie. It was hard to do, and I think it turned out pretty good. But I don't take much credit for it. So when you show up at these places, and there's literally like a thousand girls and they're all screaming your name, you're like, why? You don't feel like you deserve it.","When I dress up, I have to have a lot of help. I was in a T-shirt until a few minutes ago.","Acting is such a personal thing, which is weird because at the same time it's not. It's for the consumption of other people. But in terms of creative outlets and expressing yourself, it's just the most extreme version of that that I've ever found. It's like running, it's exertion.","I've always had an aversion to looking sexy, but I've grown out of it.","There are certain things in 'Twilight'... As much as I'm proud of that movie and I do like it, I feel like maybe I brought too much of myself to the character. I feel like I really know Bella now. But most readers feel like they know Bella because it's a first-person narrative.","If the movie is good then great, but if it's not then God, I feel so bad for that person with their face fifty feet tall, all blown up. Some people would be happy with that, that as long as their face was out there they're stoked about it. I'm not like that.","I want a cheeseburger so badly, but I have to be a vampire in a few weeks.","I have brothers, and that so-called boyish quality was something that I was deathly self-conscious about when I was younger.","My brother's a grip. My mom's a scriptwriter. My dad's a director. So it's like, at heart, I'm a below-the-line girl.","I want to make books. I want to take pictures and then write all over the pictures. And then I don't have to say a complete story, because I have the picture, and I have just a word.","Sure, 'Twilight' is really huge right now and everybody's freaking out over it, but it will go away soon and I will be back to doing what I'm used to doing: weird little movies that nobody sees.","I just want the fans of the book to be happy. I don't necessarily care about anyone else.","There's no way to eloquently put this. I just can't go to the mall. It bothers me that I can't be outside very often. And also to not ever be just 'some girl' again. Just being some chick at some place, that's gone.","Masses of girls identified with Bella in a really profound way, for want of a better word. The connection that I've seen people have - I've seen it physically. It's the characters they're flipping for.","Anytime I hear that somebody's really rich, the first question is, 'Do you do anything with it? Or do you, like, chill? You just sit on it?'","I had to act in a school play when I was about ten years old. I really didn't want to do it. But everyone had to do it so I didn't have a choice. A talent agent came and watched it and later gave me some work. It's funny because I'd always known that I wanted a movie career. I just didn't think that I would be in the movies.","I like being in movies that have a great story. I'm not so interested in being a Hollywood star. It's a job, you know. When you wake up at six in the morning every day for a week, it feels like hard work.","I would never cheapen my relationships by talking about them.","People say, 'Just say who you're dating. Then people will stop being so ravenous about it.' It's like, No they won't! They'll ask for specifics.","I never expected that this would be my life.","It's impossible to always get across what I'm trying to say, but, if I just stay honest, then I'm not going to look back on any of these interviews and wonder what I was trying to do or be.","I'm asked all the time in interviews about who I am, and I know a few people my age who have a strong sense of self, but I couldn't say I know myself and sum it up and give it to you in a little package. I don't know myself at all yet.","I wouldn't tell you anything about anybody I cared about because it becomes entertainment for other people, and it sort of just cheapens everything in your life. I would never tell you if I was dating anybody.","A lot of actors think that what we do is so important, like we're saving people's lives or something.","Hopefully my fan base doesn't lock me into 'Twilight,' you lose yourself. You should do things for you, and I have been really lucky to have things that really rock me and really move me falling into my lap.","The sad thing is that I feel so boring because 'Twilight' is literally how every conversation I have these days begins - whether it's someone I'm meeting for the first time or someone I just haven't seen in a while. The first thing I want to say to them is, 'It's insane! And, as a person, I can't do anything!'","Usually, at the end of a film it's like I've finally gotten to know this person completely, and then we're done. That actually happened on the set of 'Twilight,' and then it happened again on 'New Moon.' Each time my character Bella became a different person, and I got to know that person and take her to the next level.","I've been working as an actress since I was very young, and I know a lot of people who are actors who don't have to deal with having a persona... You know, if you look up the word persona, it isn't even real. The whole meaning of the word is that it's made up, and it's like I didn't even get to make up my own. It can be annoying.","I really, specifically, love acting, and I think it's a really cool thing to be really indulgent and follow that. I have a lot of ambitions in life, but for the next few years, I just want to be an actor. That's a lucky opportunity, and that drives me to want to be good at that.","It's hard to actually take details from your personal life and apply them a scene because, as much as you can identify with a feeling, you just get muddled. As soon as you start bringing your own stuff in, it's like, 'No, that's not right.' You're playing a different person. You can relate, but you have to leave that stuff at the door.","I would have been very happy just working from job to job, paying my rent one movie at a time. I never wanted to be this famous. I never imagined this life for myself.","Even while starting out I took things very seriously; I wasn't the sort of kid that would do a doll commercial or do a series for Nickelodeon. They asked me to do silly things, and I wasn't a silly kid.","Despite what people think, I was such a rule follower at school. I loved the whole slacker look, like, 'Hey, I don't care, whatever,' but if I didn't turn my homework in, I would panic.","I don't want to discredit people's individuality, but I think people are pretty much the same. People are very similar. If you have a good enough imagination then you can feel things that you personally have never done before. That's acting.","You know, with the film industry crews, there's an odd mix between a very technical and a very artistic approach to the work, and sometimes as a woman you have to be a little bit careful about how things come out because people don't really want to listen if it's in a certain emotional tone or too strong.","There are things that directors know about me that people shouldn't know. But everyone's really different. I've worked with women who I've never wanted to tell anything about myself to, and I've worked with guys who have been pouring wells of emotion. So emotional availability is not a gender-specific thing.","I mean, I love L.A. - I love living here. But I wish that we could make things without the need to hit a home run every single time. It's a unique thing to Hollywood that if you don't do that every time, then you're considered a failure. But it's like, 'Well, are you making movies to be successful? Or are you making movies to learn something?'","I think people are used to seeing actors be wide open and desperately giving of themselves, and while I do that on a movie set as much as I can, it's so unnatural for me to do it on television, in interviews, in anything like that. I also don't find that my process as an actor is really anyone else's business.","I just really am trying, trying, all the time. But I like to be scared. I love to suddenly feel out of control.","Actors walk around wearing these little tool-belts of acting skills. And I just don't find that interesting to watch. I never want to see someone who clearly can cry at the drop of a hat. That's so uninteresting.","I'm like, bursting. I should be working. I don't want to take a break. It's funny, on set, I don't have to go to the bathroom, I don't have anything wrong, I'm perfectly fine, so through-and-through. I'm not hungry. I'm literally not even in my own body.","I'm 19, and, being a public figure, I'm supposed to present myself in a certain way, but it's hard and you're never going to be able to tell people who you are through the media.","My best friend just had a baby, and she's my age. So I'm a godmom now, which is crazy.","I'm about to play an emaciated pregnant vampire, so I've stopped using as much butter as Paula Deen - just until 'Breaking Dawn' is over.","I don't exercise. I'm skinny-fat. I worry about being too skinny.","You don't always just have to do an indie movie to feel like you're controlling it with a few people that you really have connected with, creatively. You can do it on a bigger scale.","This weird thing happens when you're in a movie that has some level of success. People start offering you all kinds of things, and they just expect you to do them because they'll be good for your career. It's not about the project's integrity or anything like that.","I've actually always been interested in following a character more long term, but the only place to really do that as an actor is on a TV series.","There's an idea about who I am that's eternally projected onto me, and then I almost feel like I have to fulfill that role. Even when things come out of my mouth, I want to be sure I'm saying exactly what I mean.","I don't talk to anybody about my personal life, and maybe that perpetuates it, too. But it's really important to own what you want to own and keep it to yourself.","I went to public school up until junior high.","I don't think I would ever have been able to be an actress had I not started at nine years old.","I just can't go to the mall. It bothers me that I can't be outside very often.","I grew up in a happy household.","It took me a long time to realise that I was a girl as a teenager. At that point I never really believed it. I looked like a boy for a long time. Now, finally, I feel like a woman.","I've worked with women who I've never wanted to tell anything about myself to, and I've worked with guys who have been pouring wells of emotion. So emotional availability is not a gender-specific thing.","Females want other females to be really strong, so there are a whole lot of scripts that are basically just male parts renamed as a girl."],"Kristen Wiig":["I love the rain. It's my favorite weather.","When you go out of your comfort zone and it works there's nothing more satisfying.","I'd make a terrible surgeon. The fear of blood? Very high on my list.","If you're creating anything at all, it's really dangerous to care about what people think.","With improv, it's a combination of listening and not trying to be funny.","For movies to get greenlit solely based on the success of other movies that have a lot of women in them? It's so ridiculous to me.","Sometimes I need to blow off steam and go dance really hard.","When you're on your deathbed, you probably aren't counting the movies you've made.","I just always gravitate toward the kind of characters or people that maybe you don't want to talk to for a long time at a party, but you do like to watch what they're doing.","It sounds so cheesy, but there's something very powerful about looking in the mirror and asking yourself a question. Because I think it's really hard to lie.","I am shyer than most people think.","I hated speaking in public. I would miss school just so I wouldn't have to do it.","There are so many funny women in the world, and there has been for so many years, so I'll be happy when people can just move on from that, and things can just be 'comedies' and not 'female' or 'male,' and everyone gets an equal opportunity.","People are always so surprised when I want to do dramatic stuff.","I do sort of gravitate towards smaller, indie-type movies.","I really, really want to go to Paris. I've never been.","I'm not as much a history person as an art person, but I mean, you can read history through art.","I just like to walk around New York, just put my iPod on and walk around.","I probably lived more of a rock-star life when I was 15. I got in trouble a fair amount. I cared more about hanging out and skipping school than studying.","I definitely ran with a pack of hoodlums, that's for sure.","I lived in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, until eighth grade, and then my high-school years were in Rochester, New York.","I enjoy being characters rather than myself.","A big part of being in a wedding is the financial obligation, and that's something that people don't really talk about, but if you're asked to be in a wedding, you're gonna have to fork over some cash.","The weddings that I've been in have been pretty mellow.","I think it's an interesting thing to watch when a person is trying to keep it together and then ultimately when they do lose it a little bit.","I'm a vegetarian; I eat a lot of tofu and soy.","I wish I had less fear about creating my own parts.","I like to write and draw and paint, and my mom's an artist, so I think I get caught up in thinking, 'I'm afraid it's gonna be bad,' and it's hard for me to start sometimes.","I wish I had a lot of tattoos.","The good thing about 'SNL' is that it's the same people every week that you're working with, and we've all become so close and tight because we've worked together so long and so closely together.","I roller skated when I was younger, but when you're on a track that's slanted and you're with other people all skating in a pack, it's a whole different sport.","At parties, I'll start talking and notice everyone is looking at me and feel dumb and say, 'Forget it,' and then start eating things.","Maybe studios don't want to see women acting in a way that isn't womanly. Maybe people don't.","I would never wear fur.","It's not like I have boxes of scripts arriving at my door.","People always call me a comedian. And I don't really see myself like that. I guess I just consider myself an actor who does comedy. But who wants to do other things as well.","I feel like women are asked their age more than men.","I know from my own experience and from other people in the business that when you come from a place where nobody knew who you were and then there is this sudden shift to where everybody now knows who you are, there's an adjustment that you have to make.","I wasn't rich.","People sometimes get a little extra criticism when they try something that they don't normally do, but I think that's just a natural thing for artists. It's like, 'Okay, I did that, and now I want to try this.'","The public doesn't want to hear people complaining about having their picture taken.","There's something about a Christmas sweater that will always make me laugh.","Why can't there be a lot of great women who are doing great things?","I can relate to having those people in your life that you feel are moving on to this great, big, normal life and you're like, 'What's wrong with me?'","My friends back home are very supportive.","I think people like to see the lives of artists that are legends. They always go through the dark periods and I think just as humans we like to see that and them coming out of it. I love those kinds of movies.","I never think if I do an impression of someone, I'm never making fun of them.","It's fun for me to play people that are just kind of odd.","If I can be doing something in the arts till the day I die. I would be very, very happy.","Even in this day and age, if you're not married, there are people who are like, 'Awww! Don't worry, it'll happen for you someday.'","I always say I want to look haunted.","It's a mystery to me what makes people laugh.","I don't always just want to do the same thing.","You have to leave things that you love.","I don't know if you can articulate an instinct.","I don't rehearse a lot. I try to keep it organic. Even in movies, the less I rehearse, the better I am.","Mean comedy is not really something that I personally gravitate towards or something that I do.","I don't know about the romantic comedy route, although never say never.","I would rather have a small part in a really great movie than a big one in one that I'm not too psyched about.","I just want to try and be in projects that are exciting to me."],"Kristi Noem":["We've got very large freshman class, it's historic in its size, so there's people that are extremely diverse in their backgrounds and their viewpoints. I think that we're going to see a conservative group of people coming together, focused on some real ideals that are going to be extremely important.","I think labels have been used alot during this election process to divide people, and at this point in time we really need people to come together, and be their own person, come with their own suggestions, and really solve the problems that we have facing this country.","I think everyday people on the street who have never been affiliated with the tea party movement are alarmed with the spending and the debt that we have.","We have to get government out of the job of picking winners and losers. That's what they've been doing the last year and a half, getting in the way of businesses that are trying to reinvest to get our economy back on its feet.","Every one says: 'Listen, I'd love to reinvest. I'd love to hire people. But I have no idea what this healthcare bill is going to do to my bottom line. I have no idea what this financial reform bill is going to do... I'm not going to step out a limb and do any of those until I know what this government is going to do to me.'","A lot of people have tried to put labels on me, but right now I'm focused on being Kristi Noem and getting my message out to South Dakotans.","I'd rather have a real South Dakotan who has lived in this state and made her living here instead of someone with a fancy East Coast law degree any day.","We didn't come here to become Washington, we came here to change Washington.","Now make no mistake, I think we need a strong dose of fiscal conservatism in Washington, D.C.","I think we need to have competitive tax rates in order to create jobs in this country. And I think it should be fair.","So, a lot of my supporters back home are members of the Tea Party.","So when I look at spending more dollars, I look at the fact, do I really want my kids and your kids and everybody else's kids in this country to have to pay that bill?","And people talk about the stimulus package and the jobs that it was supposed to create, it certainly didn't have the intended effects that everybody was hoping for or that the president and administration certainly was hoping for. So I think it's time to lay some new solutions on the table, some new ideas."],"Kristi Yamaguchi":["I learned to put 100 percent into what you're doing. I learned about setting goals for yourself, knowing where you want to be and taking small steps toward those goals. I learned about adversity and how to get past it.","I've realized how precious life is. When I was younger, I was more adventurous. I felt invincible. I was game for everything. As a mom, I don't want to get injured because then I can't take care of my kids.","Winning in women's singles felt surreal. I felt that everything I had done - the hard work, the tough times - was all worth it.","I'm always looking for inspiring ways to stay motivated and stay active.","I always try to start out with some type of goal. Then I work backward and think of what I need to do to get there, and give myself smaller goals that are more immediate.","My experience at the 1992 Winter Olympics was my fulfillment of dreaming the Impossible Dream.","Having achieved my own dreams, I want to give to kids who are less fortunate, who struggle with everyday obstacles. I want to give them something positive in their lives: support.","I'd try to channel my nervous energy in a positive way into strength and endurance. It didn't always work.","Now, I am thrilled to be a wife and mother, and I hope to be as good of a mother as my own mother, Carole.","The past couple years training with Kurt have really brought inspiration into my skating.","I've had a lot more fun with the training.","Being an athlete, you know how to train and prepare your body for a performance and you're able to do it under pressure.","Figure skaters have awful perceptions of hockey players.","I don't mind the sparkle - I think it's kind of a tradition in skating. I don't think the men really need sparkles, but for the women it's part of the glamour of our sport.","As a teenager especially, I just wanted to do my thing and not be noticed.","They say, once you have a child, your heart is forever outside your body. I totally understand that now.","Growing up as an athlete, I started skating very young. My parents didn't know anything about the sport, so they went with the flow. I had two great coaches who gave great advice and gave guidelines for my parents. My parents let the coaches dictate what was going on on the ice.","I burnt myself out of skating. I was ready to focus on being a mom.","Before turning pro, I would never have just left my skates sitting in the locker room unattended.","There are two or three performances in your life that are absolutely on, where all the planets are lined up for you and you feel you're invincible.","As a professional, I think we're not being judged solely on technical ability anymore. People really want to be entertained and enjoy what they're watching.","This experience has been once in a lifetime.","Skating was something I really wanted to do; my parents knew nothing about it. They said they'd support me as long as I was trying my hardest and enjoying it.","Dorothy Hamill was my big idol as a kid. She'd won the Olympics in 1976. She was America's sweetheart with her personality, her talent, her haircut.","At 6 years old, the ice became a place for me to express myself. Because I was so shy off the ice, it became my safe haven, with music and freedom and self-expression. That was my emotional outlet.","I didn't want to skate for someone else or for certain marks.","I never wanted to feel I hadn't worked hard enough.","I don't know how many people really knew who I was before the Olympics and that's the fun thing of the Olympics - you get to know someone who captures your heart, hopefully.","I'm kind of a homebody. My husband says I like to just stay home and do nothing, but that's just how I am.","Probably a few weeks after I was born I started having casts put on my legs to straighten them out. After that corrective shoes and with a brace in between.","The good feeling I get from contributing rivals anything I felt on the Olympic stand in Albertville.","One of my mottos not only just in skating but in life in general and I try to enforce it as well, is like no regrets and just like going for it.","With 30,000 deaths and 200,000 hospitalizations from the seasonal flu, those numbers are certainly higher than what we've seen of the swine flu. Protecting yourself from both viruses is very important.","Training for the Olympics was a lifelong endeavor and took many years.","I'm a perfectionist.","Childhood reading is so important.","I've always worked closely with the designers and whoever's making the costumes. Comfort is the last thing you want on your mind when you're competing. In an ideal situation, you'll have something where you'll put it on and you're fine and you don't have to worry about it at all.","In terms of my career, having the gold definitely changed my life. The Olympics are different, you know? They're every four years and it's such a small group."],"Kristian Bush":["I believe the biggest challenge is just getting the courage to try something different or new. Try to forget the stereotype in your mind. Yoga is for everyone - children, athletes, moms, dads, accountants, truck drivers, even country stars.","You find your limits by going out and trying. We're just like anybody else in any other job. You just can't work 90 hour weeks. You can't do it. We can't sing seven days a week.","Each kind of generation of bands forgets how they got here. Waylon Jennings came out and they're like, 'That's not Patsy Cline.' And everyone panicked, like, 'I don't know what happened to country music, but this isn't it.'","I spent 25 years clearly understanding that I'm not gonna meet Bono or the Edge. But then it happened at the Grammys when we were all backstage and I just about fell out of my shoes.","I come from a food family, so you would think that I would be great at making baked beans or something, but I'm not.","I try to spend a lot of time thinking of what it is I want to say, and how I want to say it. Mainly because I know what it's like as a fan to hear music that is just exactly what I needed.","As soon as I saw tattoos as a way to tell your story, I thought, 'Oh my gosh, I totally get it.' So I got my first tattoo a couple of years ago, and it's the word 'hope' on my left arm. It has a couple of dots at the end for each of my kids.","I've tried to start my kids on 'Doctor Who,' but they're just not there yet. Someone had given me these TARDIS stick-em notes, so I gave them to Tucker, and he finally put them all over his locker. I'm like, 'You're the coolest fifth grader, ever!'","The first time I toured the U.K. was in the early '90s with Billy Pilgrim, so I know how much the people there love music.","I have always heard that uber-successful people who write books about how to become uber-successful all have one thing in common: They all meditate every day. I consider yoga my meditation.","I don't remember consciously not being able to play an instrument. It's been kind of like a language for me.","With Sugarland, it never felt like we were finished telling our story.","My kids don't listen to me when I preach at them. But if I tell them a story they can pull something from, that matters.","There's a social piece to what's going on in the Sugarland world, but we've never been a band that's political, and I maintain that.","I'm not necessarily in a vocation where I'm at risk; it's not like I'm a police officer. I'm a musician, so when I leave home, my family expects me to come back.","You do things for your kids you won't do for yourself.","It's a very sad thing to do, to divorce.","Sugarland was a band we started to try to make things better. It was in the aftermath of 9-11; it was in the aftermath of my mother dying... there was a lot of weird stuff that had gone on that made you want to start something good.","You will do things in private and sing in private and make choices in private that you wouldn't make if you were observed.","Music is supposed to make you less lonely - that's the whole idea.","I believe that melody is such a lost part of music and country music. People are either scared of it or not using all the colors that are available.","I love making music, but I also love making music that's on the radio. In some circles, that is considered less artistic. And I've always tried to resist those people that say the two can't exist at the same time.","When I got my record deal at Atlantic, at the time, 'indie' wasn't a style of music: it was a kind of label. And I think, eventually, the bands that ended up on those labels began to be branded as 'indie bands,' and then it became a genre.","It's hard not to go back and look at my songwriting catalog and go, 'Look, there are 600 to 700 songs here.'","There's an identity thing that goes on where you spend so much time caring for your child that, after a year or so, you have to shake it off and go, 'Who am I?'","As a promoter, of course, you'd really want the people who pay for the tickets to come into your venue to really be even more connected with the band.","I love writing music for film and TV, but putting it into a video game is twice as fun because it needs to be repeatable and joyous.","The most inspiring thing as an artist is when someone says, 'I believe in you'; sometimes that works even better than Grammys.","It's a great place to be as an artist: if you confuse your label, you're doing your job.","My voice has a lot of character and kind of doesn't sound like a lot of people's.","I've always tried to put a little message in my music.","There is a misconception that I've experienced in my life about people that live in the South. I got sent away to school in Connecticut in the late Eighties, and kids were honestly asking me, 'Do people there wear shoes?'","I always tell people that it's so much harder to make a happy song than a sad one.","My father was an officer in the Army, and my grandfather served in World War II, and I am so proud of their service. I'll always do whatever I can to support our troops.","I get intimidated by famous people. When I'm around them and they look at me like I belong, I'm like, 'Are you nuts? You're freakin' famous!' Whether it's Elmo or a Beatle or Vince Gill, it's humbling to be in a room with these folks.","Billy Pilgrim music is very emotional. It's one part the craft we learned from people like the Indigo Girls and R.E.M., and one part the Tom Waits craft, where you're trying to create a moment."],"Kristian Nairn":["I was always very into heavy metal, and heavy metal is full of emotion and extremes, and I think that's the same in dance music.","My first musical dream was to be a guitar player, and believe me, it's still in there.","Winterfell is atop of this huge mountain in Northern Ireland, and you can see all these weather fronts coming in. Basically, the sky circles the mountain. It's the most beautiful place.","I was always into classical music and opera because I played the piano as I went through school and was very interested in Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals and stuff like that. That changed into heavy metal at around the age of 14 or 13, and I dropped the piano and started to play the guitar.","I don't see why people are so concerned at what other people do behind closed doors or in their lives.","I just don't see why people are treated differently or with a different set of rules. It's just wrong.","It's an actor's dream to only have one line, and people like him, so I'm really lucky.","I trained to become a sign-language interpreter because it helps you read physical expression and the emotions of body language.","I always say, the darker the scene, the more fun it is.","There's no one else like Hodor on 'Game of Thrones.' There's no other character with that warmth, humanity, and a little bit of comic relief.","To play this iconic character from this historically wonderful series of books - who wouldn't take that opportunity and be happy about it? I'm happy to be Hodor forever.","In all honesty, when you talk about 'the gay community,' you are talking about my community, haha.","I remember the first single I ever bought. I think it was a terrible song called 'D.I.S.C.O.' by a band called Ottawan. It's a really fearless disco track from the '70s or early '80s.","I played with local bands and ended up touring with Scissor Sisters, Mylo, Alphabeat, and Calvin Harris. That somehow changed into DJ'ing.","I don't really make a distinction because when I'm acting, I feel like an actor, and when I DJ, I feel like a DJ, and when I play the guitar, I feel like a guitar player. I don't know which I prefer. I think I just like to perform, in some way or another.","I've never hidden my sexuality from anyone - my whole life, in fact - and I've been waiting for someone to ask about it in an interview, 'cause it's not something you just blurt out.","I had an upbringing to respect other people's privacy and their right to be and choose what they want, and I expect - no, demand - no less for myself.","I always have to have the new gadgets and stuff when they come out. I'm not really interested enough in learning how they work.","I have to have everything. I have to have iPads. I've had I think every generation of iPod. I've had all the consoles at least once; I've had some of them twice. I get them and get fed up with them and get rid of them.","With 'World of Warcraft,' I like the potential for wasting time.","I sorta worked out a few years ago that one of my favorite things to do in 'World of Warcraft' is look for things, to just spend the time flying around searching.","Although I have been performing in all sorts of ways and roles since childhood, 'GoT' is my first proper venture onto the screen.","I would relish a role that really shows a bit of background into how the bad guy got the way he is... a little more complex than cackling behind a hooded cloak.","I could never see myself playing a goblin or gnome, without some serious CGI at least!","I've been thinking if 'GoT' would lend itself easily to an MMORPG. I mean, it certainly has the background and incredible storylines for it, along with some pretty huge characters to hinge the story around.","I did a music festival in France. I'm not going to name names, but there were bigger bands and DJs on before me, and throughout their set, all I could hear them chanting was 'Hodor!' And I was, like, 'Oh, please stop! It's so disrespectful to the other acts!' In a way, obviously, I loved it, but it was kind of embarrassing at the same time.","I'm a massive 'WoW' nerd, and gamer in general.","Of course I have had thoughts about going into politics.","It's just making sure that everyone is treated equally. Is that so progressive? I don't think it's progressive, I think it's human. And not just gay people - women's rights, immigrants, people of different ethnic backgrounds.","I love saying 'Hodor!'","When I was a kid, I was obsessed with Thor. I had a hammer.","People either think Hodor is a very easy character to play or a very difficult one; there's no in between. But it's a lot of fun having to completely switch personalities inside four seconds, with no words. That's a joy for an actor to get to show all that complex emotion in such a short space of time.","I really wasted a lot of time in my 20s.","I really know what it's like to work and live every moment now, and I'm really grateful for that.","I grew up with the British-Chicago crossover of house music with a lot of pianos and very heavy bass lines, but what I love about house is you can mix it up a bit.","I'm a really big fan of meeting the fans. It's great to get feedback.","I've done fairly well as a performer and a DJ in the U.K., so 'Game of Thrones' really just opened up a whole new market for me.","My mother started me on the piano when I was 3 years old.","I did some musical theater and studied a little bit of acting as well.","Obviously, there's so many different types of gay people, but some people don't know that. Some people think we all look and act a certain type of way.","I'm aware of the subgenres and why they exist. But I don't feel like I have to limit myself. I don't feel like I just have to play deep house, just play tribal house, just play progressive house. I wouldn't feel right if I had to limit myself.","I think you can go too far into your subgenres. When you're talking about chillstep and stuff like that, I think you've gone a bit too far.","Any sort of performance was always what I was really born to do.","I was quite a shy person growing up, and drag was very much a shield for me to perform behind.","My drag name was Revvlon.","Just do what you want to do and don't worry about what people say.","Taller people get very competitive. When I meet someone who's close to me or taller, I'm straight up; I don't wanna be smaller than them.","'Game of Thrones' was a game-changer for Northern Ireland. There's going to be a massive gap when it goes.","I like to go out for dinner in Belfast with my friends, I like to work on the house. I like working on music.","I've had dogs all my life. I'm a huge animal lover, especially dogs, so that's one of the hardest things about being away all the time. I really miss them, but my mum does a really good job looking after then when I'm gone.","Everyone likes fantasy to get away from everyday life, but I think 'Game of Thrones' is not like fairies and unicorns. It's very relatable to everyday life. It's not too fantastic - just a little bit.","I haven't read more than two pages, but my mother is a George Martin super fan.","I think if everyone had a little more Hodor in them, it'd be a nicer world.","I never stopped DJing through the entire 'Game of Thrones' process. I never saw the need to stop because I do love it so much.","I play music for people all over the world. It's a huge privilege.","When I started 'Game of Thrones,' the first three seasons, I still DJ'd every night before I went on set. I'd finish DJing at 3 A.M. and have to be on set at 5 A.M.","I keep explaining this to people: I can do more than one thing.","I'm not saying I'm the bee's knees. But I am a legitimate musician.","Most of the clubbing I did was gay clubbing.","I recognise that, while I was fortunate enough to grow up without any discrimination or stigma attached at all, other people haven't been so lucky.","I had actually sent an audition tape for Simon Pegg's movie 'Hot Fuzz,' which came to nothing. Four years after the film released, out of nowhere, I got a call saying the producers of 'Game of Thrones' wanted me to play Hodor after they had seen that particular tape.","I wanted to be a guitar player.","I have and always will stand my ground.","I get 'Hodor' tweeted at me a lot.","I actually started off - believe it or not - doing drag. I travelled the world because I was a completely off-the-wall drag artist.","When I was 13, my mum knew that I was gay, and she just always knew.","I've never given a damn. A seven-foot man who dresses as a woman as a job is not interested in what other people think.","I don't really see myself as a celebrity.","The Raves of Thrones parties started in Australia and has since spread all over the world. However, no one does it like the Aussies.","I was a total metal-head as a teen. I still love it, too.","This is what really makes me happy: the whole story of 'Warcraft' and the lore behind it.","I'm quite investigative. Believe it or not, my mum and dad were in the police, and I sort of like to read into things and stuff.","I have no difficulty with career duality!","I love 'Tron.'","I saw what religion did to people when I grew up, and I certainly didn't want any part of it. That turned me off it.","I don't see the benefit in giving yourself a belief system that allows you to judge other people.","I think a lot of problems in this world would stop if people could stay out of other people's business.","What I've always done is be positive and do what I do.","I never thought people would be remotely interested in my silly little life, but I'm really glad that they are.","I think that's why 'Game of Thrones' is such a watercooler talking point: because there are these moments that are beautiful and terrible at the same time."],"Kristin Armstrong":["I write about the power of trying, because I want to be okay with failing. I write about generosity because I battle selfishness. I write about joy because I know sorrow. I write about faith because I almost lost mine, and I know what it is to be broken and in need of redemption. I write about gratitude because I am thankful - for all of it.","It's not only moving that creates new starting points. Sometimes all it takes is a subtle shift in perspective, an opening of the mind, an intentional pause and reset, or a new route to start to see new options and new possibilities.","When everything is moving and shifting, the only way to counteract chaos is stillness. When things feel extraordinary, strive for ordinary. When the surface is wavy, dive deeper for quieter waters.","Life is too sweet and too short to express our affection with just our thumbs. Touch is meant for more than a keyboard.","Times of transition are strenuous, but I love them. They are an opportunity to purge, rethink priorities, and be intentional about new habits. We can make our new normal any way we want.","When we focus on our gratitude, the tide of disappointment goes out and the tide of love rushes in.","It's easy to lose sight of God when life is sweet and easy, but there is something awesome about despair, and it is the closeness of God when we are at our weakest.","When the seasons shift, even the subtle beginning, the scent of a promised change, I feel something stir inside me. Hopefulness? Gratitude? Openness? Whatever it is, it's welcome.","Pause today and notice something you have worked hard on and recognize yourself for it. Acknowledge your effort.","I think I run my strongest when I run with joy, with gratitude, with focus, with grace.","We all have our ways of handling fear and managing trying; jumping in or climbing down, a direct approach or a delay, joyful or miserable, a spirit of adventure, or God help me, get this thing over with.","I love the big fresh starts, the clean slates like birthdays and new years, but I also really like the idea that we can get up every morning and start over.","No matter who is watching or paying the paycheck, we are ultimately each our own boss.","Every year, I appreciate life more because of the deeper understanding of what it took to get this far.","I never imagined that divorce would be part of my life history or my family's legacy. When people say that divorce can be more painful than death, I understand why. But like any great trial, God uses everything for good, if we allow Him to heal us.","Sometimes when we have so much going on, it's easy to forsake the things that seem like personal luxuries - for example, our morning run. But it isn't a luxury at all, when it is the thing that allows us and empowers us to face everything else.","I want to be intentional about my freedom - in choosing it, honoring it, and protecting it. One of the best feelings I know is feeling truly free.","Whether I'm running, working, relating, parenting, learning - whatever I'm doing, I want to surround myself with people who push me.","When I forget who I am, I remind myself by finding my stride. I remember that I am strong, free, and loved, and that with God's help I can weather whatever comes.","Disappointment is a sticky one, because no one can steal contentment, joy, gratitude, or peace - we have to give it away.","Real connection and intimacy is like a meal, not a sugar fix.","Circumstances in life often take us places that we never intended to go. We visit some places of beauty, others of pain and desolation.","We either live with intention or exist by default.","The best thing to do when you find yourself in a hurting or vulnerable place is to surround yourself with the strongest, finest, most positive people you know.","Runners, by nature, are intentional people and normally pretty light on our feet.","Typically creative people are usually not clock-slaves or list-makers, so the idea of enforcing goals and deadlines can be somewhat daunting.","To me, there is no greater way to achieve clarity than to run alone, or share miles with a trusted friend.","I find significance in all kinds of small details when I run; I'm hyper aware of my surroundings, the sensations in my body, and the thoughts running through my mind. Everything is clearer, heightened.","The time I spend in the morning - praying, sipping coffee, and coming up with my list - is a ritual I relish. I have done it for so long now that I subconsciously measure whether or not the things I'm doing match with what I should be doing, what I want to be doing, and the life I want to live.","Running fills the cup that has to pour out for others. Running feeds the soul that has a responsibility to nourish. Running sets the anchor that limits the drift of the day. Running clears the mind that has a myriad of challenges to solve. Running tends to the self so that selfishness can subside.","Running fills a need so we make fewer demands on others. Running reveals the roots of negative thinking, so the weeds can be pulled. Running reconnects the soul to the source, inspiring hope and creativity.","Freedom is not the absence of obligation or restraint, but the freedom of movement within healthy, chosen parameters.","As my children leave the protected parameters of the bay called childhood and enter the wavier seas of adolescence, I'm starting to get seasick.","Runners and yogis are alike in lots of ways, and not just because some of us need yoga to unkink what running jams. Runners and yogis are also alike because of this tortoise shell idea, this 'home' we can access inside ourselves.","Before I got divorced, I was personally unfamiliar with trial, or at least trial of serious, heart-wrenching proportions. I figured that life went smoothly if you tried hard, and if you messed up, or things weren't working out, you just tried harder.","If your husband asks what you think, tell him. If you have a preference, voice it. If you have a question, ask it. If you want to cry, bawl. If you need help, raise your hand and jump up and down.","When we focus on our pain, our ache deepens.","One of the best things about good mothers is that they remind their children to take care of themselves.","I run hills anytime I really have to think.","I think, as most of us do, I put such high expectations on myself that this spills over onto other people. And not everyone is wired this way. Some people can shrug expectations off their shoulders like a cardigan, remaining cool and breezy. Others wear them like a parka with a stuck zipper, hot and stifling.","Parents walk a fine line between discipline and grace - values have to hold even when circumstances change or call for compromise or compassion. It's the ultimate challenge to be both firm and fluid, soft and strong, yielding yet rock solid.","The things I write about are the things that I am passionate about, interested in, and fighting for in my life.","I realize that I am typically vulnerable only when and where and how much it suits me. I can choose my writer words and even go back and edit."],"Kristin Bauer van Straten":["My personal style is really comfy: flats, tennis shoes, ponytails, no makeup.","So much of our lives are defined by habit or what the guy next to us is doing, never wondering and knowing who and what we support with our actions, from the detergent Mom always used, to my favorite dish I make... A lot of my life is unexamined habit.","Sometimes I'll read an audition and I'll get a very strong first impression about who the person is, and I usually go with it.","My acting teacher used to say that people reveal themselves in their opposites.","Unless you're a serial killer, you're worried about being liked by somebody.","I, personally, like to get dressed and then do my makeup and hair in about five minutes.","One of my main techniques for acting is I try to know almost nothing beyond the words that I have to say, because that's my zone of control.","I can watch endless humans get killed, but if I see a movie and they kill a dog, I practically want to walk out.","People can do all kinds of things that maybe aren't wise in hindsight because of jealousy.","Fans are afraid to meet me. They're sort of afraid for their lives and won't look me in the eye.","I am no longer able to be anonymous.","I paint. I love the visual arts.","The movies and TV shows I like to watch tend to put their characters in situations where they have to dig deeper.","One lesson I got from Gandhi, 'Be the change you want to see,' haunts me. I just feel like I can't keep stomping around pointing the finger at BP when I am supporting the oil industry with my very own dollars and actions by buying their products, helping to pay their mortgage - plastic is from oil... polyester, shower curtains."],"Kristin Cast":["I am unique, a sheep, intimidating, scared, powerful, beautiful, flawed, and perfect in the same moment.","Oh my God, I used to get heartburn and all sorts of indigestion and stuff because I didn't feel well. And you know, I sit a lot because I write, and I gained a whole bunch of weight. My vanity just got to me, and I was like, 'I've got to do something!'","No one in high school wants to be put under the spotlight. You don't want to be that person who stands up for the other people because then the people who are going after those people are gonna come after you.","No one wants to be the kid who allies with the weird kid.","I don't watch 'Glee,' not that I have anything against it. Whenever I miss the first few episodes, I won't watch the series.","I was really the first-line editor of the 'House of Night' series. I didn't write that much of the story, and I didn't know what was happening until my mom finished the book and sent it to me because I wanted to read it with fresh eyes as a general reader would.","I think 'House of Night' blew up the way it did because it offered so many people a fantasy that they can be... vampires are very alluring.","I'm learning a lot, and I'm trying to make it so that every time I write, it's better than the last time I've written.","I am expected to be glamorous and untouchable. Like success would make me spoiled and entitled. However, I am just a normal dog-owning, horse-riding, meat-eating Oklahoman.","As boring as it sounds, I don't feel any different than I did before the 'House of Night.'","I've gained fans, fame, fortune, but I don't feel different. Am I supposed to?"],"Kristin Cavallari":["I have a lot of sides to my personality and what you see on 'The Hills' is a strong, independent woman, which I am. But I also have a sensitive side that I don't show too much.","My personal style can be everything from girly and flirty to edgy and chic.","GMOs are linked to digestive problems, among other things. Antibiotics and growth hormone are other additives being excessively pumped into the animals we are eating, which means we're then consuming these excess antibiotics and hormones. And some processed foods actually contain toxic chemicals, often used to prevent spoilage and enhance flavor.","Never say never, but I don't think I'll ever get Botox because we don't know the long-term side effects, and I just don't think that can be good for you.","I like to think I have quite a few different styles - sometimes it's a bit rock n' roll, other times more girly and feminine.","It's important to let kids be themselves and to let them make mistakes. Self-discovery goes a long way.","I think a lot of girls look up to me because I'm a strong woman.","I sort of have stepped out of the public eye, and it's actually been really refreshing.","It's so crazy to look at your life and see how far you've come.","I always wanted kids but I always thought I'd have kids later on in my life, maybe when I turn 30. I really wanted to focus on my career, but you meet the right person and your whole world changes.","I would never put my close friends or a real relationship on a show.","Actually, if I don't eat healthy food I don't feel good. For me, I crave healthy food.","I say what's on my mind. I go after what I want.","I think it's important for people to know that there's no such thing as a perfect relationship, you know?","Having an infant is stressful, and I know I won't get a lot of sleep initially, but it will be worth it.","I moved around so much when I was younger that I sort of had to have this type of exterior; you know, I was afraid of getting hurt.","I think the hardest part of being a working mom is that I miss my kids a lot.","I'm a big fan of Kate Moss's style - no-one nails boho meets hippy chic like she does.","I'm very open to dating and finding a guy.","Sometimes, in order for things to get better, they have to end - even if it's momentarily.","I own a lot of shoes; I am not sure how many.","I like to wear what I feel good in, not what the latest trend is.","I don't shop online. I'm always scared to put my credit card on the Internet!","Headlines are so great in a sense that they can take a little bit from an article completely out of context and blow it into something it's not. Some people really only read headlines.","It's very difficult to change the perception people have of you.","If you're looking for a boyfriend, you aren't gonna find one. They seem to come into your life when you least expect it.","Sometimes guys are so concerned with being cool and hanging out with their friends. They don't want to seem like the guy that 'has to call his girlfriend.' It's just boys growing up.","It's an unwritten rule - girl friends' boyfriends are off limits, even after they break up.","If a guy won't commit, he's a player.","I'm completely done with reality TV.","I don't typically drink coffee.","I don't really regret anything in my life.","Everything that I've done has made me who I am today. You know, it's cliche, but it's true.","I hate watching myself on screen! I absolutely hate it, it's so hard to watch. I can see myself in magazines, but watching on TV or movies is like, 'Ugh.'","I mean, I can tell within the first two minutes if I'm into someone or not. I can always tell if I get butterflies.","I have no urge to go back to college.","Nothing you see on TV is real.","I would love to have my own shoe line. That I would absolutely love.","No one's ever told me I needed to get a facelift or anything.","I'm not a big dancer!","Dancers carry themselves in completely different ways to how we do in our everyday lives. They are very free with their bodies which I'm not used too.","I don't want a huge wedding. I don't want it to be some huge spectacle.","I hope that I'll be hot for a long time so I can make a lot of money, I can retire early, and just travel. Hopefully that will happen.","I love Chloe Sevigny's style - the way she manages to add a touch of rock n' roll to every look.","I've been known to sext from time to time. Gotta do whatcha gotta do! Even if it means you are doing five other things at the same time and just going along with it for your man.","People don't know the real me. The hard times I went through are what led me to my life now. I was a mess as a teen! I was kind of wild and really unhappy.","Every child is completely different. My two boys are opposites. Camden was such an easy baby. Jaxon is more of our rebel wild child, but he's also a mama's boy.","'Laguna Beach' was definitely not as manufactured as 'The Hills' was for me. 'Laguna Beach' was more putting us in situations where we normally wouldn't be in or hanging out with people we wouldn't necessarily hang out with.","It happened on 'Laguna Beach' where you don't know what's real and fake, and I saw cast members who couldn't distinguish what was real and what was fake anymore. It was kind of scary to see, so I kept them very separate so that I didn't go crazy.","The only time producers fed me lines on 'Laguna Beach' were more fake phone calls or pickup scenes. We'd film for nine months out of the year, and then they would start cutting episodes together, and they would realize that they needed a specific scene.","My dad was very excited about me doing 'Laguna Beach,' and he thought it was a great opportunity. My mom, however, living in Chicago, was a little nervous. I mean she had some reservations about MTV. I think there was a point in my life where I wasn't even allowed to watch MTV!","I was kind of a tough girl. And I guess that came through, like, moving around, my parents getting a divorce, different step-families, and stuff like that. I'd been through a little bit more than most people who are just from Laguna Beach.","I felt like I really came into my own when I became a mom. My entire world changed.","I've always had a little pooch. I just always have - that's just my body type. No matter how skinny I've been, it's always there. And now that I've had kids, I sort of don't mind as much because, you know what? What my stomach and my body went through is truly a miracle.","I always give myself a three-month period where I would just hibernate and wouldn't even think about the baby weight. I would just be with my baby in my own little world. And then, once I started getting more energy and wasn't so tired, then I would hit the gym.","I think if you just eat healthy, you're active, and you don't beat yourself up, you're setting yourself up to win rather than setting yourself up for failure.","I'm the most boring pregnant woman ever.","I'm - like, 80% of the time, I'm the biggest health nut. I'm usually really healthy.","Coconut oil is one of them. I call it miracle oil because you can literally do everything with it. I have it in the kitchen, and then I also have it in the bathroom. It's great as a hair mask, too; I actually put it on my hair yesterday.","Before I got pregnant, I was doing Pilates a couple times a week, and I actually loved Pilates. I noticed a difference with my core, which is my problem area, so that was nice. For me, I don't do a lot of cardio. I lift more weights.","Goat's milk is the closest thing out there to human breast milk. Plus, it is more easily digested than cow's or soy milk. Giving goat's milk to children is popular in Europe and other parts of the world.","I truly believe that everything I need to flourish nutritionally is found in nature and that some stuff just shouldn't be messed with, especially the food I'm putting in my body.","I really believe that my family's infrequency of getting sick is due to our diet.","I live in Chicago, but my work is always in New York or L.A., so I always have to travel for my job.","When you finally have kids, you realize how selfish you are. I think we are naturally selfish beings. When you have kids, that can kind of be a shock at first. I think just trying to make time for yourself is very hard. Especially now that I have 3, finding that time can be very difficult.","I have such a great relationship with my mom that I'm so excited to, hopefully, have that same relationship with my daughter.","I just want to raise a confident girl. I just want her to know that she doesn't need to be sending naked pictures and doing all that stuff - I'm definitely going to monitor everything. I want to raise her to know that she can go do whatever she wants in life and to be comfortable in her own skin, which I think also just comes with age and time."],"Kristin Chenoweth":["As much as you can eat healthy, it's also important to remember to drink healthy too. Tea is very healing.","If you can learn to love yourself and all the flaws, you can love other people so much better. And that makes you so happy.","I don't understand what the big deal is with gay marriage. Get over it, people.","Oatmeal tastes so good on its own, you don't even need to add sugar.","Apples, grapes... any kind of fruit gives me the energy I need to get through my busy day.","I just want to say, that if Jesus were alive, what would he be doing? Well, he would probably be accepting and loving people how they're made. And I always say this and it's really the truth. If being 4'11 was a sin, what would I do? Well, I could wear heels and I could add a wig.","Not everyone is going to like what you do or what you have to offer; however, if you can't see yourself doing anything else, and you have the drive and ambition, get the training and go for it.","I'm trying to learn, as I'm in my 40s, to embrace what I've been able to achieve and be proud of it. And I know there's roles that I will want to play before I die, but I'm still just taking one day at a time.","I am a Christian and I don't want there to be any confusion about what I believe or who I am.","I think it's important to remember that Christianity was based in love and tolerance and forgiveness and acceptance.","I used to want to be tall, and then I thought, 'If I were tall, then people would say I was pretty and not cute.' And then I realized that there are worse things than being called cute.","Broadway is such a diverse community. Everybody knows how I believe, and everyone believes, and it's not a big deal. But in Hollywood, if you talk about politics - especially if you're a Republican - or spirituality, it's just not something people want to hear about.","I'm constantly learning, and that is the greatest gift of life in my opinion - to always be learning and growing.","You've got to find ways to breathe while you're dancing so that when it comes time for you to stop and sing again, you have it. To prepare, I do a lot of aerobic activity. Many times at the gym, people will look at me because I'll be on the treadmill humming.","It's in God's hands.","A nice pair of Jimmy Choos never hurt anyone.","I'm a wild lady. Not.","Well, you know, people don't know me as a country artist and I am new to the genre. But that's how I grew up singing.","And I do - make no mistake, I am a Christian and I believe in God, and I don't believe he makes mistakes. So I don't believe that being gay is not a sin, and in fact it's how you're made.","A lot of kids are bullied because of their sexuality, and that breaks my heart, because they're going to have to - high school's hard enough to overcome. Middle school is hard enough to overcome when we get out of it. They say life is what you spend your time getting over because of high school, you know what I mean?","I want to be a Christian like Christ - loving and accepting of other people.","I was a spiritual kid.","I've finally graduated from 'I don't give a hoot.'","There's a difference between making fun of something and having fun with something.","You've got to find ways to breathe while you're dancing so that when it comes time for you to stop and sing again, you have it.","We are what we eat, so I eat as many veggies as I can!","I'm finally dating. It's fun.","I read my Bible and I pray and all of that. I really do. But at the same time, I don't think being gay is a sin. Period.","I auditioned for a solo in church and got it. I was about seven and I sang a song called, 'Jesus, I Heard You Had a Big House' and I remember people standing up at the end and me thinking, 'Oh, I think I'm going to like this.' That's how it all began. Sounds funny to say you got your start in church, but I did.","I want people to understand that there is a group of Christians out there who want to be more open and understanding and tolerant and loving of all kinds of people, even the people that don't believe in God at all.","I was on the cheerleading squad and drama and the choir, but I was friends with everybody. I was not a partier. I was too Type A and crazy about my grades, but I was still there at everything."],"Kristin Davis":["Sometimes it would be nice to just have some red wine with dinner, but it's not worth the risk. I have a great life, a great situation. Why would I want to risk self-destructive behaviour?","It's nice to be with someone, but I don't think you need to be in a relationship to feel complete. That would be really sad.","I may not be perfect, but I'm trying.","I like green or brown eyes. Tall but not overwhelmingly so. I like men who do yoga and meditate.","I've been dating since I was fifteen. I'm exhausted. Where is he?","I'm an actress who likes a strong, communicative director.","I'm not about to go out and buy a snake for a pet. I mean, I may have faced a few fears but I'm not insane.","Also, it was a cultural moment that wasn't being represented in terms of women who were successful and had choices they didn't have before. They needed a show that they can watch that they felt like represented them.","As an actress, there's nothing worse than not knowing your cues.","But you know, our show is our show, and it's not for everybody.","Dogs are very, very pleasant with people that they're connected to.","Everyone would talk about their diets and working out and what it made me do was go to craft services where all the food for the cast and crew was and I would eat.","I also like men who like dogs. I couldn't date a man who doesn't like my dog.","I just loved being in the theatre with all those crazy, creative people.","I love animals and I love to see movies with animals that are done respectfully, you know?","I love theater.","I think I can speak for all four of us on the show here. We all consider ourselves to be feminists and we get very upset when people don't think we are. We're like, where did this come from? Of course we are.","I was very poor and I was a waitress, and it's hard to be a poor waitress in New York.","I'd wanted to be an actress my whole life, that was my goal, that was all I cared about.","I'm having a great career, though I think I'm not as good as your little scenario makes me out to be.","I'm just happy when people want me to work for them.","If I'm walking very, very fast down Madison Avenue in the middle of the day, I'll say I'm stopped 10 times.","Let's just say that I don't think our show has very much in common with the book any more.","Never, never did I think I would be in a Disney movie.","Our mothers' generation fought so hard to change things and we're the first generation to benefit. And now you get girls in their twenties who say they're not feminists.","Personally, I don't think we could do such a show if we didn't get along. The subtext of all this is that we're women in a show so we can't possibly get along. It's not like they write about The Sopranos like that.","So it was good for me to play a likable person and it was just an amazing situation to be in.","Sometimes, when you're acting, you are so in the moment that you don't even remember what just happened.","The Carrie in the plot was too much like the Carrie in the book. She smoked, she swore a lot, she was very hard, very cynical. I could never have pulled it off.","Where I come from, a lot of people didn't have money, but they didn't have gangs or drugs either.","I would never describe Charlotte as a prude - maybe at the start, but that was in comparison to the other girls. She wasn't willing to do the stuff they were doing - and I mean, thank goodness!","We were very rich culturally. One Sunday each month, we would do this thing called Chamber Pots at somebody's house. A classical music group would come over and we'd have dinner. There were thirty people - parents and kids - and we'd sit on the floor and listen to this beautiful music.","If I was going to do anything, I'd be a producer, only because I'd like to have a say in what gets made and what doesn't.","We all get so caught up in our day-to-day lives and have so many gripes. But when you see the way others live and how they make the best of it, you'll realize how lucky you are.","I'm not really much of a shopper. I have to say that I'd definitely prefer good sex. What makes good sex? Oh my god. I think you need to feel free and you have to really trust the other person. And you have to have that strange, mysterious chemical connection.","This is going to sound strange, but I really didn't think I would pass 30. I don't know why or whatever, I just didn't. That's a very weird thing to say, I'm sorry. I don't know. Maybe it's because I was drinking so much as a youth.","I drank a lot when I was a teenager and I don't drink any more, because that's when I thought, you know, I'm gonna end up a car wreck.","Alcoholism is a genetically predisposed disease and it does run in my family. I also think I felt like a misfit. I was in the South, everybody was blonde. I just didn't feel like I fitted in. It was sort of my way of fitting.","I probably believe in God in a non-denominational way."],"Kristin Gore":["I'm allergic to caffeine. When I have it, my throat gets sore, and I get a rash.","The wrists, the Achilles' tendons, and the neck are some of the weakest points of the human body, so a lot of people have phobias about those things. I can't deal with the undersides of wrists.","When my father became vice president, I was a sophomore in high school. I'd do things like go on a run with my soccer team and purposely dodge the security van. Then my parents compromised with the Secret Service when I went to college. I just had a panic button in my dorm room, so if I pressed that, they'd be there within 2 or 3 minutes.","It's all discipline and schedule for me. I mean, it's very easy to get distracted by the real world and things that intrude constantly, and it takes dedication to live totally in your head and be tuned out.","I was one of those dorky kids who'd wanted to go to Harvard since the fifth grade.","I'm just grateful that my parents still love each other.","From age 7 on, I wanted to be a writer.","After writing for TV for a while, I got sort of fed up with all of the cancellations and the volatility in that industry. Also, you're always writing for someone else's character and story, and I really wanted to develop my own.","Whenever Congress was in session, we were in Washington. So four months out of the year we were in Tennessee and the rest of the time in Arlington, which is where my mom grew up. Then, of course, in 1992 we moved into the vice president's house in D.C. I was 15 then.","I didn't realize I wanted to write about D.C. until after 2000. Even though I was a comedy writer, I stayed away from that subject on purpose. It took attaining some distance and perspective.","In my free time, I'd written 'Sammy's Hill' - it had started out as a play. I just did it for myself.","My parents were enthusiastic fans of 'Sammy's Hill.' But they think 'Sammy's House' is a better book.","I make things up for a living. It would be pretty boring to just fictionalize real people.","There's this perception of D.C. as a boring town run by old white men, but in reality, there are incredibly young people in charge of really important things.","Any writing teacher tells you to write what you know, and for better or for worse, Washington is a world I know well.","I love the satire and skewering of comedy writing.","I can't look at people's wrists. Something about the veins makes me weak. My siblings used to torture me with that because they knew it was the thing I couldn't handle. They would stick their wrists in my face.","I was really nerdy. Compared with my sisters, I often felt like a boring person because I lived so much in my head and in books.","You think about D.C. as a boring stuffy place. That's kind of its image. But if you grow up in that, you see all these energetic, fun people and crazy stuff that happens behind the scenes that no one knows about.","When I read books, I actually really love imagining whomever I want to in the character's role. I get such vivid pictures on my own that that is a big part of the experience for me.","'Jitterbug Perfume' is one of my favorite books.","I've seen some version of 'An Inconvenient Truth' since I was born.","I always wanted to be a writer, from being a little kid onwards. My dad and my mum both had phases when that was what they did.","The one thing I witnessed over and over were these pretty young people who would throw themselves into a cause larger than themselves and believe they could change the world.","In actuality, 'Sammy's House' can and should be read as an entirely fictional comedy set in a fascinating political world.","Take it from me: I really love making things up, which is why I write fiction for a living.","I can go days without meaningful human interaction.","I don't really go into labels or an in-depth discussion of different value systems because for me, it's sort of the truth of the situation in D.C. Certainly, in my fictional depiction of it, there are decent, shameless people on both sides at every level.","My dad has a dry, deadpan sense of humor, and my mom has an unexpected, wacky take on things. They really encouraged laughing at ourselves and the weirdness of situations that come up growing up in politics.","I like my leaders smart and serious. I don't need a stand-up comic.","I consciously decided to make both 'Sammy's Hill' and 'Sammy's House' more of a warm satire and not go the route of writing a dark and bitter book about D.C.","Both of my parents have great senses of humor."],"Kristin Hannah":["We women. as glue for the family. lead lives that are important and conflicted. What we women choose to give up for our families is important and valid.","The hallmark of my books is the relationships that define women's lives.","I can be a little OCD when it comes to my writing.","I am such a Pacific Northwest girl.","What I know now about life is this: your mother is a part of everything you do and everything you are.","Whenever I write about motherhood - and I write about it a lot - I am drawing on my experiences as a mother and also my experiences as a daughter.","A romance novel focuses exclusively on two people falling in love. It can't be about a woman caring for her aging mother or something like that. It can have that element, but it has to be primarily about the male-female relationship.","Sitting around and waiting for your muse is not the best choice."],"Kristin Hersh":["I'm beginning to think I have two years encountering sexism without really realising it.","We need a day of the dead. That's a perfect celebration.","Before you can make good music, you just have to shut up. Then the music can say what it has to say.","Good taste - that's all you really need when you're playing an instrument.","I don't have the inclinations that other people seem to have as far as the business is concerned.","I don't like the idea of famous people.","I don't like what the radio plays for the most part.","I don't mind what the market is, but why is it vapid? If they're such a bunch of idiots, why don't you show them good music instead? They're not going to know the difference.","I felt like it was a great secret when I found out that I could be in my 30s.","I grew up in a commune where no one considered me female, particularly.","I guess I'll just slip into the studio after the next time with the Muses, and then just keel over and die.","I have to play as much of the game as I allow myself to get the music heard. But it's not unlike the rest of the world, so I'm not as up in arms about it as I could be.","I would go to radio stations and they were supposed to be interviewing me and playing my record and they would say, We're playing too many women right now, we can't play your record.","I've always chosen my band members based on their sense of humor. It might sound stupid, but it means not only are they fun to live with on a tour bus for years, but humor implies intelligence.","If you're the band leader you ask more of yourself than anyone else, so they tend to raise the bar for me.","Men are allowed to write songs about people and women are allowed to write songs about women.","Most of the younger people I knew didn't seem to have a handle on things; they hadn't found their place, they didn't understand how the world works, they didn't understand how to treat other people, and they didn't know how to stop thinking about themselves.","MP3's are perfect.","My brother and I were meditating before we were 6 years old, having to stare at the wall and chant.","My parents didn't treat me as if there was anything in the world I couldn't do, except be unkind.","Nirvana was pop. You can have distorted guitars and people say it's alternative, but you can't break out of pop music's constructs and still get extensive radio play and media coverage.","Popular music sucks so bad right now.","That's my dream job, to be able to mail songs out to people who want to hear them. Paste my face on them and not travel all over the world trying to sell them.","The songs become the show, which is how it should be.","The songs keep on writing themselves, and I really love them. It's as close as I get to a religion.","To do it nationally or internationally, you have to follow a few more rules.","We didn't really swallow much of the Jesus thing, but we got the vocab.","You have to follow every melodic line, every emotional idea, or you don't get your money's worth."],"Kristin Kreuk":["When I was in elementary school, I used to write letters to myself. I'd write letters and go 'Dear Kristen-at-16-years-old, happy birthday. I hope you're doing something.'","Just because I don't do bad things doesn't mean I don't have bad thoughts.","I just want to portray a very honest character that displays traits that people can truly relate to and can help them - the audience and myself because I learn from the characters as well - help them see themselves in a perspective that is outside of what they know already, and grow from that experience.","In high school, I was the biggest procrastinator in the world.","I did gymnastics when I was growing up and to this day I can still do the splits.","It's not that easy to find someone I can relate too. I'm tough to crack because I'm shy.","I quit karate originally because it wasn't something that I was initially passionate about.","There isn't a specific person in my mind that I'd want to play. Yet.","I wasn't raised with a specific religion. I wasn't raised to judge people in any way.","I took piano for many years. I kicked and screamed through all of my lessons, but my mom really insisted.","I didn't play video games because my parents didn't allow it. That was banned from my childhood experience.","I can travel anywhere in the world and I can pretty much fit in.","I was one of those kids who wanted to do everything, I wanted to be a marine biologist, an actress, a writer, an environmentalist, an activist.","I get uncomfortable in large groups of people and loud music.","I think the education I've had as an actor I would never have had at university."],"Kristin Lehman":["I injured myself quite badly when I was seventeen. I broke my ankle, and it didn't heal in such a way that I could keep dancing at the level I wanted to. It wasn't like, 'Oh my god, I'll never play the violin again.' I could, but not at the level I wanted. So, I segued into acting, the other thing that was also meaningful to me.","You have to carry so many archetypes as an actor, especially as a blonde-haired, blue-eyed one.","I ran for ninth grade class president. Came in a close second.","For 'Motive,' it wasn't a question of making it look un-Canadian, but instead, we wanted it to be the product of a bunch of really skilled people making something. And that's what you have.","I didn't expect to feel pathos for the villains in our show. I feel quite moved in several of our episodes; I never realized that a show like 'Motive,' which aims for a broad appeal, could have that sort of emotional impact.","I'm a journeyman actor. My experience as a journeyman actor is that you have to go where the work is. I've never been the lead; I've never been in that position.","I'm a character actor; that's my skill set.","I want to live a good life and pay my taxes. 'The Killing' was a blessing. It was two wonderful years. But I had reached a point in my life, especially with a young son, that I was no longer willing to compromise my life for the sake of a paycheque. I was no longer willing to move where the tax credits are strong."],"Kristin Renton":["I love playing the bad girl.","I feel like any time you, as an actor, can be surrounded by other amazing actors, you can't do anything but grow."],"Kristin Scott Thomas":["It doesn't make you feel very good being mean and fierce; it is much nicer playing people who are kind and sweet.","I am so bored with seeing stories about a mature man of 65 falling in love with a beautiful girl of 32.","I know I can be bolshy and really unpleasant, and it always happens if I lose confidence in the people I'm working with. If I've got no confidence in what I'm doing and they don't provide me with some assurance that we're doing the right thing then I bully people. I'm a horrible bully.","Life is too short to live on low-fat everything.","There's something incredibly sexy about sand and sweat and dunes photographed like women's backs.","In fact, in many ways my mother was quite hippy-dippy, serving macrobiotic food and reading 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.'","Boarding school is a wicked thing.","The Cannes film festival is about big-budget films but also remarkable films made in different political regimes by film-makers with little resources.","I think people do work too much. I've never been able to understand the whole 'make hay while the sun shines' thing. Either I want to work or I don't want to work.","I'm not at all fed up with British films, but I am fed up with playing upper-class people.","If you're feeling insecure and you need to feel special, the best place to go is somewhere foreign where people treat you as special because you're different.","After a long time with someone, you realise you've been thinking for two.","I can't get into all that physical stuff of having to have flawless skin... Sometimes you see people and it looks like someone's got an eraser and made their face a little blurry - their traits seem to go out of focus.","I do a film because I like the story and I want to give life to a character - I don't necessarily have to agree with the director.","I'm a bit of a Doubting Thomas - always worrying about things.","I just get so fed up with seeing the same things written about me. If I see the words 'ice queen' attached to me, I feel like banging my head against the wall. There's this perception that I can only be in a film if I have a glass of champagne in my hand and a stately home in the background.","At school, I always wanted to belong to a gang, and no one would have me. So I'd have make my own gang, but with everybody else's leftovers.","I never go straight to the point if I can go the most difficult way. Why be simple when you can be complicated?","People accuse me of being Methody, but I'm not at all. The one thing I don't want people to see is me. I don't want them to be able to recognize my faults and failures and qualities, and I won't use those things to spark off emotions or to illustrate.","I find it difficult to explain, but I'm quite ashamed of being an actress.","Having a leading man who is actually prettier than you are is quite upsetting.","Buy, buy, buy, buy! They want to grab you and trap you and turn you into little Elizabeth Hurleys.","I was happy, I wasn't beaten, and I lacked nothing. But it wasn't what people expect - it was very much sort of pinching and scraping. I don't know how my mother did it.","Seeing The English Patient is wonderfully draining, but imagine acting in it for six months.","People are always saying, English, English, English rose, and I just feel so completely different.","I find it very difficult to be two different characters at the same time - actress and mother.","Movies make you immortal and ageless.","It takes a long time to appreciate one's parents.","You have to think about whether that Mercedes-Benz you have is actually worth how much it costs to you.","I've realised that I am who I am and that is it. Like it or lump it. I'm not around to please anyone any more, and it's a huge relief.","I was very lost as a teenager. Which is a horrible way to feel.","I am sure that, had I grown up with both parents, had I grown up in a safe environment, had I grown up with a feeling of safety rather than danger, I would not be the way I am.","I was terrible at school.","I tend to do things that I'm very frightened of. That's what I do.","I'm not used to being asked what I want to talk about. That's why I'm an actress. Get told what to do, stand on the mark, say your words, wear this, look this way, look that way.","The parts I've been most successful in are the ones I've desperately, desperately wanted.","I love shooting French films because I don't have to stick with being sophisticated or stuck-up.","Successful films are very dangerous things.","If you make a film about a pig farmer in Wales and you are a huge hit as the pig farmer's wife, the next thing is you'll be asked to do a film about a sheep farmer in Scotland.","Men don't fall in love with me - only young ones.","I really like acting in French. It's actually quite different for me, from acting in English. It's fun acting in a foreign language. You're liberated or freed from preconceptions.","I wouldn't want you to see me all the time on the screen, because I get bored of it myself!","I'm very lazy!","I do not want to pour out my heart to the world. I am cautious of what I say and to whom.","We older women in Europe are lucky not to be shoved away in a drawer.","I try to make films that I find exciting. It makes me want to get out of bed at five in the morning, have my make-up done and play for the rest of the day.","French culture takes ageing very seriously. There's much less ageism than in Anglo-Saxon countries.","Often, the roles I'm offered in England are melancholic women who are filled with regret for the past, regret for their fading beauty.","I do consider myself as being French, I suppose.","I know people think that I always play these characters who are in control and can chop someone's head off with a look.","Everyone loves to hate a spin doctor.","I never raise my voice!","I still absolutely love 'The Sound of Music' and anything with Julie Andrews in it.","I can't move back to England. My home is in France now. I'd love to but I can't. My family's all there now.","I have a feeling I will work for a long, long time. I like it a lot... and I don't know. I just have a feeling that I'm going to be one of those people who go on for ever.","Most films seem to be about a man and a women falling in love at some point and once you pass forty-five, it's almost disgusting to fall in love.","With the theatre, your whole day is geared towards the evening's show, and that's the job. People usually go to work about 9 and come home around 5, or maybe 7.","When you make a film, you sign a contract with somebody, and it's not only legally binding but morally binding. You agree to give this man a certain number of weeks of your life, and you just go for it as much as possible. Because, whatever happens, the film is going to come out, so you might as well try very hard to make it a good one.","It's very hard having a career in different continents and two different languages.","My life is European.","As a younger actor you want to be approved of, you want to gain respect, be admired. All of those things. To say: 'This is me playing this character. And aren't I fantastic!' I don't feel that so much now.","I mean, my father was killed when I was six. And I only have tiny, tiny flashes of memory.","I have never met a woman who works who doesn't feel guilty. I mean we all deny it like crazy but deep down there is always that voice saying you should be at home.","I'd love to do some comedy. Particularly French comedy, which I know sounds like a contradiction in terms.","I'm not one of those famous people flying round the world emoting over every catastrophe. I'm too feeble.","As an adult, it's a huge shock to be orphaned; as a child it's just hideous, ghastly.","My body is a baby machine.","Sometimes, I think I could have been a major movie star with the vast mansion and staff. I look at my Volvo and think it could be a limousine. I think of the roles I turned down. But then I wouldn't have had any children.","If you are a successful actor, which is what I am, then you tend to get labelled very quickly and easily.","I'm very wary of trust, you see.","Making films can be absolutely fantastic, but it can also be incredibly dull. You spend the whole day sitting by yourself in your trailer and then you get called to deliver one sentence - then you're told to come back and do it again at 5:30 the following morning.","We all come in different shapes and sizes, and that's fine by me.","Baths are my favorite thing. I can have two, three a day.","I like the idea that I'm making things that people might think and argue about.","I mean, if you're being directed very precisely by somebody who has admiration and who's really smart, it's great. If you're being told what to do by a nincompoop - and luckily that hasn't happened very often - it can be very frustrating.","The problem with being a film actress or a movie star is that people see you so huge that somehow you're visually massive or somehow you're in some removed space, which is a television or wherever. It somehow takes your humanity.","I think in most jobs, you get better as you get older. You gain experience, you gain knowledge.","I think the sheer number of pop stars has kind of drowned out, somewhat, our interest. We're just submerged.","I just don't see very many films. Because I make them.","Having a career is a bit like navigating an Atlantic crossing - you have to make sure everything is keeping and is balanced.","I think I'm inspired mostly by other artists that aren't actors, like writers or singers or artists, for being so brave.","I don't want to have to be pretty. I don't want to have to be adorable.","If anyone says, 'Let's have a girls' night out,' I will run in the opposite direction.","Now, playing a love interest can be really thrilling, if you're working opposite thrilling people.","French is a foreign language, but I've been speaking it since I was 18 so it's second nature to me.","Exoticism can give you an edge: it makes people assume you're cleverer than you are and gives you the upper hand.","'The English Patient' was a huge turning point in my career and my life; it became this huge thing. But the whole Oscar build-up got completely out of control; I spent more time talking about that film than I spent making it!","I'm very good at forgetting people.","I'm a late developer.","I used to be so intensely preoccupied by unhappiness... now there are times where you might get down, but you can move on much faster now.","People will now go to films with subtitles, you know. They're not afraid of them. It's one of the upsides of text-messaging and e-mail. Maybe the only good thing to come of it.","When I speak English, I've been told, I have this patrician way of speaking that's very irritating. It's the whole class thing.","My children are lovely. They're perfect.","Films are just consumables.","You don't choose a film because it's made by a woman, you choose it because it's good.","As actors, we're always asked to portray and react to these extreme circumstances, otherwise it's not interesting. They are agonizing things to think about."],"Kristina McMorris":["My childhood memories of my grandparents are of a wonderful, complementary couple. While my grandfather had a spirited, humorous personality, my grandmother is gentle and poised.","Before the day my grandmother shared her treasured letters with me, I honestly wasn't much of a fiction reader, let alone creative writer.","'Letters From Home' is a story inspired by my grandparents' epistolary courtship.","'Letters From Home' is a 90,000-word WWII love story with a twist, aptly summarized as 'The Notebook' meets 'Saving Private Ryan.'","From 2001-2008, I was the host and a writer for the WB's weekly television program 'Weddings Portland Style.'","Only thanks to blissful ignorance, and the inspiration of my grandparents' story, did I actually believe tackling a novel would be an easy task. I've since learned otherwise.","Several years ago, I was creating a Christmas present for the family, a self-published cookbook featuring recipes my grandmother had collected and created over decades. While interviewing her for the biographical section, she began to talk about her courtship with my late grandfather.","People often refer to bygone days as a simpler time. Perhaps, more accurately, my grandparents' generation focused better on what mattered. Traffic jams and minor quibbles with my husband Daniel pale in comparison with the worries that were faced on the home front and battlefield during the Second World War.","On occasion, I like to reread my grandfather's letters. While leafing through them, I'm saddened by what is being lost in modern communication. Soul-baring sentimentality isn't typically poured into text messages, tweets and emails. All too often, personal connections are brushed aside for the sake of convenience in a fast-paced world."],"Kristine Kathryn Rusch":["As for indie writers, a lot of them don't realize that they're in the hurry-up-and-wait business, not the wait-and-hurry-up business. They work really, really, really hard at goosing the first-month sales, and then getting disappointed when those sales either go down or never happen in the first place.","Publicity doesn't work for books. It really doesn't. All it does is get your name in front of a reader who might then glance at your book. Or not.","Indie writers who promote their book instead of writing the next book are wasting their time. The more books you've written, the more books you'll sell. That's how it works. That's how it's always worked."],"Kristine Opolais":["I am a good wife, so I think we need to live where my husband is working.","Every normal woman that is a mother will do everything for your baby to make sure he is happy. Every mother understands that the baby is only happy being with his or her mother.","Maybe I will end up in the movies.","When I go onstage, every situation I have to play, I feel pain. When I sing 'Madama Butterfly' I feel completely everything she felt: It's horrible.","That's why I'm never happy. Every tragedy, I really feel very painful - especially about a child or old people. This is reality. We try to close eyes and ears, but it's happening every second, and somehow, unfortunately, I feel a connection.","I never wanted to be an opera singer. I wanted to be an actress, maybe a rock singer.","My voice is not angel voice.","Sometimes directors come to me when I have to play some horrible thing, scary or hysterical or crying; they ask, 'Did you study somewhere to be an actress?' No, this is life. That's why I think I don't want to say you need a really bad experience to be a good artist, but bad experiences in your life say something.","As a person who wants to see and believe in the story, I don't think women at age 50 are able to sing young girls.","Nobody is pushing me. Nobody is telling me what I do.","I didn't want to be Nelsons's wife. I wanted to be soprano Kristine Opolais.","Having a child changes everything.","I wrote my own pop songs and sang one of them when I went into a stupid beauty competition when I was 16. That was my public debut, and it made my mother even more determined that I should go into opera!","The point is that I am such a big fan of Puccini and that Butterfly is the most difficult and complete role that you can imagine. Just to sing it with a good voice is not enough: it asks tears from your soul. I am very emotional on stage, and the music is so tender that I suffer for real when I am singing it. So I cannot do many performances.","Someone was always trying to put down my individuality and personality, making me sing Mozart arias that were nothing to do with me.","You can make a debut in 25 operas. But to make a debut at the Metropolitan Opera is huge.","Puccini is my favorite composer.","I'm very emotional: to lose love is the same as dying.","I am not playing on stage. I am living the situation. I cannot cut emotions and sing. I never save myself.","I go through every single emotion. My artistic life will likely be shorter than it could be because everything is for real for me. This is my life and my soul.","I hate everything that is rigid. I need freedom."],"Kristoffer Polaha":["I did Shakespeare in college and the nerves I got doing Shakespeare are the same nerves I get doing 'Mad Men.'","When I met my wife, I was 24. Obviously, she wasn't my wife. She was just a girl. I made her my wife later on.","I did Shakespeare in college, and the nerves I got doing Shakespeare are the same nerves I get doing 'Mad Men.' I want to get the dialogue just spot-on.","I liken actors and movies and TV shows to football teams. We all have our favorite ones.","Like the rabid fans of sports, the same goes for fans and their actors, TV shows and movies. You love what you love, and it bonds you with others who love the same thing.","The pressure is self-imposed because I always want to do excellent work, and I always want to be interesting to people watching me.","A hit show takes Hollywood magic indeed, but it also takes a lot of math and science, plus the study of polls and trends to make and sell a TV show.","One incredible tool to accomplish bringing a product to the public is to put a face on TV shows, movies, and the actors in them by using good PR.","Now, there is no business like show business, and there is no publicity like word of mouth. What is word of mouth, you may ask? Well, word of mouth is gold to Hollywood bigwigs, and it equates to box office bonanzas and hit TV shows."],"Kristy McNichol":["From the time I was very young, I was a professional, making money and assuming responsibilities. I didn't live the life of a child. I was living the life of a 30-year-old.","I say to my mother all the time, 'You're the child.' And she says, 'Yeah, you're the mother.' I've been that way with her since I was 11.","I didn't know the word no, because I wanted to please everybody all the time. Every kid does.","My mother always wanted to be an actress. She was an extra in movies and stuff. I have a feeling this is the classic story: The mother wants to be an actress, and the child ends up doing it. But it was never a jealousy thing between us. It was like - well, I was making my mom happy.","I was wanting to be a kid at 18 instead of being a young woman.","A lot of people have wondered what I've been up to. I retired from my career after 24 years. My feeling was that it was time to play my biggest part - Myself!"],"Kristy Swanson":["I would rather take the role and work and make my own money and self respect than to have sex with someone who has a lot of money.","When people are reading a book, it's a personal thing. They're reading it; it's in their own mind; it's in their own personal space when they're reading it.","I won't date a guy who doesn't own a toolbox. I'm not saying you need to be able to knock down a wall or build a house or anything like that. But I've been out with a couple of guys who didn't own toolboxes, and they couldn't even change a light bulb.","I've always been this strong-willed person and I've always been in love with acting.","I love every aspect of show business and that includes both the show part of it and the business part of it.","I wasn't an overbearing child. But I was aggressive. I always managed to get what I wanted somehow.","Going to school at home saved my life as far as education went. My parents were able to give me the attention I needed.","After about a month of living on my own, I began to feel it. I bought some plants. I remember I named one of them Penelope, and I would talk to her and water her every day. Apparently, I over-watered her, and she died. That's when I knew I needed a roommate. So I got one.","I can't ask for every movie I make to be great and brilliant. I can only try.","When I was around 9 years old, I was watching TV one day. I was looking at this commercial, with a kid in the bathtub playing with a rubber ducky or something, and I said, 'Where do those kids come from? How come they get to be on TV? I could do that stuff.'","My parents were like the kind of people who read the 'Enquirer' and believed everything it said.","I've been fortunate enough in my career that I haven't been typecast at all."],"Kriti Sanon":["We are all somewhere or the other a little grey, not black and white. We have our imperfections.","Every thing in life that's first should be a celebration or celebrated with a lot of oomph.","I come from a middle-class family, but we are open-minded people.","If you request for a little time to fulfill a commitment, you're accused of being arrogant. I repeat, I've achieved nothing to be arrogant about.","I feel that modelling has groomed my personality and made me a confident person, but even today, when I go on the ramp, I get nervous. I am more comfortable being in front of the camera than walking on the ramp.","After a point, it doesn't matter where you come from. There are many star kids who haven't done well in the industry and rank newcomers who have done amazingly well.","Sudheer Varma is very easy going and very confident director. He knows exactly what he wants. He has a very good vision and knows how many shots he wants for a scene. He is super fast. He gives freedom for actors to try different things. The atmosphere on the sets was never serious. We had great fun working together.","I'm an independent woman and a feminist.","I want to play a character with grey shades.","You have to face fears head on.","If you don't come from film family, it takes time for people to register you. When you don't come from film family, the connection with the audience takes time to build up; it happens eventually.","Destiny plays an important part, but talent and hard work is also important.","I am just a beginner. The two films so far are baby steps. If I develop an attitude, I'll be finished even before I've started. Besides, if I started misbehaving, my folks would give me a tight slap.","Before anyone else, women need to accept that neither does life stop, nor does it change for those few days in a month.","My career is doing well both in Tollywood as well as Bollywood.","I played a tomboy character in 'Dohchay.'","The title 'Dohchay' is very perfect for the film. It is used very well in the title track. If you see the film, you will understand it.","I think every industry is a male-dominated industry. Whether it is Tollywood or Bollywood or India as a whole, it is male-dominated. We stay in India, and it has been patriarchal society.","My mom keeps khabar of everything, so I don't feel lonely.","I auditioned for quite a lot of films. I do not wish to name the films I auditioned for. There were times when I knew I would not be fit for this film, or I would not get this film. Still, I used to audition for it just to get experience... to practice.","I have been a little lucky to get work. I know there are people who struggle a lot to get a film; I believe a lot in destiny. Things have fallen into place for me.","I am sweet and diplomatic in real life.","There is a slight tomboyish side to me. But I was studious, and I did not bunk classes!","It's better to focus on one film rather than take up two or three films at the same time.","When I did my first film, I did not understand or speak Telugu.","At the end of the day, it is about what you are doing in the film.","Categorisation of actors has become outdated now.","I could not make mistakes while choosing films when I started out.","False stories used to affect me initially. But now, I've come to understand that if false stories are created, they are also forgotten in the long run.","I was horrified to find out that a startling percentage of women, even in Bengaluru, do not go out or wash their hair during their periods.","I thoroughly believe that shaving is the best way of hair removal, as it's the most convenient and hassle free of all the methods.","Women simply need to know the right technique of shaving to get the best results.","I would never do anything that's derogatory to women.","After graduating, I began auditioning for films while continuing to model. I did a few fashion shows, ad shoots, and even got a few Bollywood offers, but nothing great.","I was clear about the fact that my first film should be 'big,' since it's the start of your whole career graph.","There was a lot of pressure on me when I signed 'Dilwale,' and though it did not do as well in India, overseas the business was crazy despite competition from another film.","I'm learning to work under pressure. Yesteryear songs are slow and demanding on the expressions.","I don't know how I would react to the casting couch. I'm sure that at that moment, you won't really know what to do. Whatever you do at that moment is instinctive.","I don't know how much of the 'casting couch' exists in the industry, as I've not seen it myself. I'm glad that I've not had to.","I will always choose to work in a movie based on whether I would want to watch it - if I would be willing to spend money in a theatre on it. The script and the people you will work with come after that.","When you don't come from a film background, getting the right debut is important and difficult, as you don't have the sensibility to know what will work and what won't.","I hope I get an opportunity to work with Akshay Kumar and Prabhu Deva, as they are very supportive people.","Whatever you learn will never go waste. It will be beneficial for me in future.","I have declined projects made under big banners because I didn't have much to do in them.","I started modelling while still studying. I liked doing television commercials and being in front of the camera. Lots of ad directors told me to try for films.","I had learnt Kathak for six years from the age of eight and did a foundation course from Kathak Kendra in Delhi. I was not fond of classical dance, but today, I'm glad my mom made me do it.","I come from a family of working professionals: my dad is a chartered accountant, and my mom is a professor.","People have started recognising me. I can't move around as freely as I used to.","I can't stand on the roadside and have Pani Puri like before. But, at the same time, being an actor makes you feel special. People look up to you, want to know more about you, and shower you with so much love without even knowing you personally. It's overwhelming.","I wasn't really fashion-conscious earlier.","These days, we are scrutinised by everybody. Girls in the industry put a lot of effort into it. You can't be overdressed or underdressed, your make up has to be subtle and there's a lot of brainstorming that goes into it.","The industry has been very warm and welcoming, especially since I am an outsider.","I am very instinctive when it comes to a script.","For me, my first hearing of the script matters. It has to excite me as an actor and as an audience.","I wasn't the most confident kid in school and college.","The more you do, the more you think, the better you get.","Even my family is shocked that I chose this profession.","I actually moved from engineering to acting. I think what's important is how talented and passionate you are.","My career is too short for there to be any turns! But I would say that not everyone is noticed and accepted in their debut films. I was accepted both by the industry and the audience.","I think less is more. Sephora has these nude themes, which is like 'no make-up' make-up.","In the mornings, I use a good moisturiser and a colouring lip balm. In the evenings, though, I like to go a little glam.","I am an engineer by profession, but I knew I wanted to act. My parents always encouraged me, and when my father shifted to Mumbai for work for a brief while, I came along.","The more successful you become, the more known you become, everything you say is minutely scrutinised a lot.","You really have to think a lot before speaking, and the things that are written about you, sometimes you might not like it.","I think I'm someone you would really break down easily, so I have to work on that.","The moment I lose weight, it shows on my face, and given how sharp my cheek bones are, it doesn't look good.","When I was young, I remember the first song I danced to was 'Akhiyan Milaon,' because I am a big fan of Madhuri Dixit.","I wouldn't have taken up modeling as a profession. It was more of a hobby.","In Hyderabad, I suppose my height does pique people's interest, but it's not like it's unacceptable. If you are confident about what you are doing, height doesn't make a difference. You can't be perfect in everything, you know!","I'm not much involved in sports, and I don't play, either.","Akshay Kumar and Prabhu Deva are a team that you always want to be a part of.","Some people do believe that any publicity is good publicly, but I don't. I would never want to be in news for rumours.","Actors don't have to be linked in real life for the chemistry to be translated on screen.","Whatever happens, happens for the better. I was meant to do 'Raabta.' Every film has its destiny, and it's the film that chooses you.","'Dilwale' has increased my audience reach; I have gained in every way possible.","I would love to do a biopic on Madhubala. She was very pretty. I really admire her.","I would love to play a completely negative character if it's backed by a super script.","I believe in comfort and dressing according to my body type. I have a tall frame. So a lot of things suit me more than it would others."],"Krysten Ritter":["We all know what it feels like to be an outcast or a loner or to fall between the cracks. To be the target of gossip or people talking about you, or girls are ganging up on you. One minute, they're your best friend; the next, they call you on three-way.","I like to be stylish and edgy, but also low maintenance.","What I'm doing is making sure that I have a balance, and that allows me, I think, to be a better actor and to more easily and quickly access all of the emotions on the scale. I make sure that I read a book on the weekend or read something or do my knitting or do the things that I need to do for myself, like 'Game of Thrones.' Get that balance.","When you prepare for something, you can then play around; you're not as worried about remembering your lines because you already know them so well. That's where you can find the freedom. So I'm all about prep work.","I've written pilots. I wrote a movie.","On the farm, I had chores. I had a calf. We had a herd of cattle in the pasture. We'd go and get me a calf at a cow auction with Amish people, which I would raise. I gave it a bottle every day, in this cute little coop, like a giant dog coop almost. I've always been a big animal person.","I'm a creative person. I love to write, I love to act, I love to perform, I love to create things with my hands, so I do all of these things that are kind of like hobbies in a way. They're things that I love, so it's not like a work-life balance; it's just a work-life marriage.","I'm currently single, so I want to have fun! As for what guys need to do to date out of their league, it's all about the swagger. If you have confidence, you can get pretty much any girl.","Marvel and Netflix have proven they know what they're doing.","I believe in women having a voice, being empowered, speaking up, and having ideas.","I don't normally do shoots in bikinis - I'm just not that kind of girl. But for 'Maxim' I was like, 'Bring it on!' I wanted to wear the higher heels and the skimpier bathing suit. I figured I'd go for it!","If someone says, 'I love 'Jessica Jones!'' I just say, 'Thanks, I love you back!'","Netflix is like sitting at the cool kids' table. Netflix is amazing. We're the biggest fans of not only working there but of the company in general.","I am sarcastic and dry, but I also have a pretty huge zest for life.","It's hard to fight in high heels or even jeans that are too tight. You can't kick in skinny, skinny jeans.","I try to put a positive spin on things.","I'm a weirdo. I don't leave the house unless I have to.","I'm having a great time. I get to travel and see the world. And yeah, I'll have a family, because I don't want to miss out on that amazing experience, but it's not defining who I am.","If you really want something, you've gotta just do it and not wait for other people to hand it to you.","I love 'House of Cards,' I love 'Bloodline,' I love 'Orange is the New Black,' so I had written on my refrigerator that I was looking for 'groundbreaking television on Netflix.'","I encourage girls to lean in, use your brain, get in there, get in the conversation.","I'm all about time management. I have gotten my makeup prep in the morning down to, like, four minutes. There's just not enough time in the day.","I was always loud and obnoxious and giggly and funny.","I used Vamps as a casting couch! I pretty much did, because I was casting 'L!fe Happens' while I was on the set of Vamps, and anybody I had ever worked with, I asked to be in this movie.","I've watched 'Clueless' as many times as humanly possible. Like, I would run home from school to watch it. Like, I can quote it backwards.","When I go home to Pennsylvania, my cousins who live in small towns and are twenty-three with kids are like 'Krysten, when are you getting married?' 'When are you having a kid?' Honestly, those aren't the most important things to me right now.","I have a new little stray dog that I've had for about a month now. His name is Mikey Mohawk - he's this little terrier with a natural Mohawk. My friend found him hit by a car on Pico Boulevard.","When I was 15, I was scouted at the mall by Elite Model Management. I started to go to New York on the bus in high school, which was about four hours door-to-door from my hometown, until I moved to New York and lived in models' apartments all over.","I started studying acting, got commercials, and here we are 100 years later. I'm acting and writing and I have a pool and a dog.","I'm the only person in the entire world who has never see 'Dawson's Creek.'","I was totally picked on, but look at me now! I was definitely picked on by boys and girls. I was really lanky and skinny and the boys would say, 'Turn sideways and stick out your tongue, you look like a zipper.'","My parents actually wanted me to join the service.","I've never been a fearful person. When I was growing up, I wanted to be an actress, a writer, and a musician and I never really processed that those are the three hardest jobs - I just never even processed it.","I've always lived out of a suitcase. I was in a new city every three months. When I was a model, I traveled the world, and as an actor you're traveling from movie set to movie set. So I've never been in one place long enough for anything super-bad to happen.","I'm not conventional. I try to be raw and vulnerable and gross.","I understand the feelings of being the outcast and the loner.","I'm not a wallflower, and I encourage girls to live that way.","After I've knitted for a while, I feel like I just woke up from a nap. And what's awesome is that then you have a product! You have something you made with your hands!","My gram taught me to knit when I was little, and then I came across my old knitting tools when I was cleaning out my closets after 'JJ' season one and got right back into it.","Different is good. Different is great!","I never imagined myself playing a superhero because I don't see myself the way superheroes have been portrayed or shown to me my entire life.","I'm a lanky girl, naturally.","If I'm not working, I don't even put makeup on.","When I'm shooting, that's all I do.","If you see a dog in a hot car, and you think that he's in danger or that he's been there for a while, it's good to speak up... Go into whatever businesses it's parked outside of, and just raise awareness about it.","Besides boutiques, I love H&M. Affordable and adorable.","It's hard to find that perfect dress that makes you feel like a million bucks. I've found a few, and I wish I could wear them over and over and over again on red carpets.","My favorite face wash is Aveeno Foaming Face Wash, and I get it at CVS or Rite Aid. It's the best. It gets off makeup, but it's not drying, and you feel clean.","I try to drink a lot of water and always moisturize. When my skin gets cranky, I use Proactiv to keep it clear. That stuff really works.","'Bonfire' was kicking around for a very long time. It was an idea I wanted to explore for a television show. Then I was given this weird gift of time when 'Jessica Jones' finished season one. I got really organized and just kind of banged it out, but it took a long time. It took two years to even have a first draft.","After 'Jessica Jones' came out, I started hearing firsthand from a lot of women who were so inspired by the character, who felt represented, who felt like watching Jessica on screen helped them in their own lives. Women are devouring content like that because everybody is complicated; not everybody is one thing.","My first audition was for a Dr. Pepper commercial.","I thought that our first New York Comic Con for 'Jessica Jones' was epic because we had a pretty major reaction from the crowd after showing our first episode!","It's exciting to originate Jessica Jones. There's obviously more freedom in that versus playing a well known character.","'Sharp Objects' is honestly one of my most exciting reading experiences.","Everybody has that: everybody knows what it's like to go home and then regress and not be running from something, not like who you were when you were home. I think everybody relates to that.","I'm an actress, and I write, and I produce stuff. I have a guitar, and I have my knitting stuff. I have a lot of things going on; I love to not ever put all my energy into one thing fully.","Marvel is obviously a giant, global super-brand, so being a part of that is exciting because of the huge built-in audience and the appetite for it.","Marvel has, like, 9,000 characters. They could do a horror movie tomorrow and call it Marvel. They can do anything.","Jessica Jones is such a great part, and I do serious work on it. I feel really creatively fulfilled.","I didn't want to play the wife of some guy my dad's age.","My favorite part of 'Jessica Jones' is... all of it.","The thing about Netflix is that you get more minutes in your episode because there are no commercial breaks. You have time to let things breathe and be quiet. You get to see an entire scene play out instead of just jumping halfway in.","There are a lot of times when Jessica Jones is alone in her house, and there's no dialogue. She's rough around the edges, so getting to spend that time with her and see her be vulnerable and process the weight of her world is what makes the character so likable.","I don't have a lot of clothes or a lot of possessions to bog me down.","Any time you get to play or dress differently or look differently, as an actress, that's incredibly exciting.","I worked with my acting coach one-on-one for hours and hours, every single day for two months, before even setting foot on set or putting on Jessica Jones's clothes.","I'm from a small town, a farm, a hundred acres.","Thematically, I like playing with the ideas of stuff that you try to bury, and you think will go away, but instead you carry it with you until it becomes crippling. And sometimes you have to look back and deal with some stuff in order to truly move forward.","The more messy women that we put on screen, that we put in books, the more women can feel represented and seen, then they can access their own stuff, feel it's okay, and then have the strength to speak out about things like we're talking about. About rising up.","It's hard to always be reduced to the way you look or your sex appeal or what that is.","I live in Los Angeles, mostly, and have a lot of girlfriends and a full life out here.","I read the entire 'Alias' series. I devoured them.","Every day, you try something new. So I just try to keep myself healthy physically and nutritionally.","I kept telling people, 'I really want to do something like 'Breaking Bad,'' and then people would remind me, 'Krysten, you were on 'Breaking Bad!''","When you go to Marvel, they lock you in a room with the scripts; they really are that secretive.","I think it's important to be flexible and free, and you can't be free and spontaneous if you don't know what you're doing.","For me, rehearsal is very important, and I spend a lot of time doing it. Also, I work with my acting teacher for hours and hours before walking onto any set.","I don't fight for much, but when I fight for something, it's usually because I think I'm going to be right.","I've been bouncing around from comedy to drama and TV and film.","I'm sort of missing that part of my brain where I look at anything as a challenge. I always have.","The most rewarding thing is having a job that you love. It's not a luxury that everyone in this world enjoys.","I hope to someday have a fully functioning production company.","With 'Jessica Jones,' I'm in almost every frame of the show.","If they want to do a 'Defenders 2,' I'm in.","I didn't know how to throw a punch - why would I? Who knows how to throw a punch? Now I do it all the time, and it makes me feel strong.","It's really hard to sell a script, and it's even harder to get a movie made. It just almost never happens.","Sometimes, as an actor - and I've witnessed this with other actors that I've worked with - you don't realize that it's not all about the actor.","I feel really fortunate that I've been given a lot of roles that were very different from each other. For me, variety is the key. I don't want to play the same thing over and over again.","I have a lot of girlfriends. That's sort of my whole thing is, I have really, really deep friendships, more so than anybody I've ever met.","I'm a total girl's girl.","I love Tina Fey because she acts and she writes and she's hilarious and does a lot of different things.","Whatever headspace you need to live in for your character is sort of where you stay in between scenes.","I try to bring myself to every role. The last thing you want to seem like to other people is a talking head or an actor reading lines.","I think that the more comfortable and the more you rehearse - granted, I don't like to take the air out of a tire; there is a fine line - but I think the freer you are with your dialogue, for example, the more open you are to a good idea walking up to you.","I was always an outcast, even in my family.","A lot of actresses start out modeling because it's a great way to sort of get your foot in the door. That's all it is, though. They open the door, and you have to walk through it.","I knew I could always work harder and be better and show I'm more prepared. I had a whole science to, like, how you have to arrive 17 minutes early to something. If you're 20 minutes early, that means you're too eager, but 17 minutes gives you time to, like, settle, sign in, use the ladies' room, have some water, and get comfortable.","'Daredevil''s a great show; I feel like 'Jessica Jones' is a great show, and I feel like they really are tapping into something.","I think backstory is really important to know because I'm all about prep work. I like to do all of my work right away, as soon as I get it. I'm incapable of procrastinating on anything, so I like to do all of the work.","If we're at a lunch table, I'm going to always sit with the girls. That's just kind of how I am. I always gravitate towards women. I know how to communicate with women.","When I'm breaking in a character like Jessica Jones, I have this amazing opportunity to create her backstory. It's all of the work that happens before I'm ever on camera... Writing 'Bonfire' was like doing all of that fun stuff; it was like 300 pages of prep work.","Yarn, patterns, and needle sizes have come such a long way since your grandmother's afghans. Creatively, there is just so much to get into, so much to play with. It's an amazing way to turn inward and get off your phone.","When I moved back to New York, I saw a lot of girls knitting on the subway, and it had a bit of a comeback.","My Instagram is basically all knitting, my dog, and a little bit of 'The Defenders.'","I have such a crush on Tony Robbins and his passion, empathy, and sheer talent.","For solace, I love a book that opens up my perspective.","For escape, I love popcorn thrillers that you can read in a weekend, like 'Sharp Objects' and 'The Woman in Cabin 10.'","My favorite acting books are Stella Adler's 'The Art of Acting' and 'Sanford Meisner on Acting.'","I'm definitely scared by commitment.","To be honest, I didn't love the high-fashion world because models aren't always treated that well. I was a scrappy kid from a farm, and that world felt a little snobby. But I was grateful for it, and my photo shoots now are really fast because I know my poses.","I'm very into dresses, shoes, and makeup.","There are different audiences out there, and everyone has different tastes of what they want. And it's a good thing because otherwise, there wouldn't be enough stuff to go around.","It's rare to get a part in a show that's greenlit, let alone two shows that have been greenlit.","I'm not always the first person to run out and see something I'm in. I don't know; for me, that's not why I did it. I did it because I wanted to act. I don't really think about the end result. I don't feel like I have to see it - for me, it already happened.","I just sort of choose to see the good in things, and I choose to - I don't know - look on the bright side, as cheesy as it sounds.","There's only one person for every job. You can try all you want, but if you're not right for it, you're not gonna get it.","I've always been very positive and very resilient."],"Krystle D'Souza":["Sexiness is in what you cover, not what you show. When you are covered, you leave a lot to people's imagination. People see the mystery in my eyes and find it sexy.","Call it a coincidence, but my mother used to feel that I bear some resemblance to Poonam Dhillon.","I strongly believe in God. I go to church every Sunday, and if I happen to miss it, then I make up for the loss by going for it during the week. Whenever I spend time in the church, my mind is at peace.","Whenever I have any beauty doubts, I always look up the Internet for solutions and remedies!","Being the youngest ensures I'm the most pampered one of the lot!","I love shopping! I look for new shopping portals. I keep buying a lot of stuff online. I don't follow any one person per se, but if I feel that the particular wear will look good on me, I pick it up without thinking.","When I'm alone, I silently talk to God. Also, at the end of the day, I have conversations with Jesus, where I just talk about my day, my actions and give thanks for the blessings I have received. I do this, as I believe I have a friend in Him.","I have always loved fashion, trends, style, make-up and hair, but yes, some sort of a transformation truly happens when I play a 'bahu'. That's when I have to wear brown lenses to cover my green eyes, colour my hair dark, wear saris, and surprise myself that I can pull this off, too.","I am not really superstitious but do follow certain established norms.","I believe in doing yoga and do Vajrasana for 20 minutes after every meal. I also do cardio exercise to lose fat.","The child in me wanted to try out new things and do something different.","When I don't feel like getting ready, just a pop of colour on the lips does the trick for me. I have this fond liking for RUBY WOO from Mac. It's a Matte red colour and makes all the difference.","Who doesn't wants to be seen on the big screen? But that doesn't mean I will be a part of any project. TV has given me recognition, and I need to live up to the expectation of my audience.","I am very clear about keeping my professional and personal lives separate. I don't want to talk about certain things, and that's the way I am.","It's nice to know that people are so interested in my life. But I have never shared anything with the media. I like to keep quiet.","For my character, I mostly shot in the jungles and also did stunts and fight sequences on the harness. At the end of the day, I used to be hurt and bruised, but I completely enjoyed doing all these.","I don't think every relationship needs to be defined.","When I was approached to do a digital show where I will be giving away hair and make-up tips, I instantly got excited because that is something I like to do.","As a person, I love dressing up. I wear make-up when I am meeting a friend or going for a meeting or even when I am out for a coffee for that matter.","One need not spend too much of time and money to look beautiful.","I'm not superstitious. But my mother doesn't allow me to cut my nails after dark. Earlier, I used to wear a scapular from Potta around my neck, given to me by a family member. But during my shoots, it's not possible, so I tie it on my right wrist for protection.","I don't recite prayers as a blanket rule, but having said that, I do believe that prayers like The Our Father and Hail Mary are powerful prayers.","No matter how much you make the world a part of your life through social media, it's never enough. They all want more, and I truly understand why. It's their never-ending love for me that wants to know every detail of my life possible.","About my love life, I would like to say I am single till I have a ring on the right finger and a wedding date.","When I work, I work non-stop and so hard that I barely get time to see anything but the set and home. So whenever I am done with one show, I go into my globetrotter mode and just pick a place and disappear for a while.","When I started out, I had no idea what I was doing. I was 16, and acting was a new, exciting thing. So, I took it on. It was an excuse to get away from college.","I didn't even know how to speak Hindi or act. I didn't think about fame and money. I didn't talk about money with the producers, as I was a minor. My parents handled that part. But I am from a family where money was never an issue.","I think fantasy thrillers excite audiences as, inherently, people have a fascination for the unknown and the unexplained.","I was tired of the same saas-bahu family dramas that I was being offered, so I took a long break.","Many actors are not willing to wait and take the risk. They get restless sitting at home and, eventually, take up anything that comes their way. It's not that I wasn't offered supernatural shows and love stories again, but I chose to wait for the right opportunity. I deserve variety, or I will feel stagnant.","The best part is, I can speak Hindi fluently. Earlier, I would cringe at the idea of delivering even a one-line dialogue in the language, but now, I can mouth a five-page monologue without blinking. My diction has improved, which has enhanced my performance.","I have groomed myself over the years. When I started, I had skin problems, and had no idea what look suited me. I have put in a lot of efforts and worked hard on every aspect.","I believe opportunity doesn't knock twice!","My family is extremely supportive of me. My mother has been accompanying me to the shoots, and my father used to drive me around for auditions.","It gets monotonous for an actor to repeat roles.","When you are constantly around other professionals, you end up learning and growing.","My fans have been supportive. Their love has pushed me to do better in life.","I don't think I look great. I only see flaws in myself on the small screen. I make an extra effort to look good.","I feel that if I am uncomfortable, it will show on my face.","If someone decides to go ahead with a project that I had rejected earlier, and it works out well for him or her, there is no point in feeling bad.","I don't want to take up a project for the sake of it. I want to work and follow my passion, and not anything else.","Supernatural characters allow actors to experiment. The role isn't restricted to standing in the kitchen and crying. I love doing that, too. But I have done enough of that.","Every day, I have a parcel waiting for me at home because I have shopped something, as I have physically stopped going to places to shop. I don't shop from malls because the stuff there is very common. I like to be unique and different.","In a regular soap, you do the routine stuff, but in a supernatural show, there are so much more to do and learn.","I am very interested in behind the scenes, and I am very creative.","I want to do good work and not take on any movie. I want to do a good movie where I have the most important or very good role.","When I do a film, I want people to be spellbound by it.","Being an actor, I have to blow-dry, colour, and use all sorts of products on my hair. The best-ever 'Pantene Total Damage Care' range takes care of the damage from the core. The shampoo and conditioner both have been life savers for me and have saved my hair from all the damage it goes through due to the daily styling.","I oil my hair once a week with warm coconut and almond oil and wash it after an hour of application. The days I don't shoot, I make sure I don't even blow dry my hair after a shower. I also use heat protecting serums and leave-in serums before styling.","I have a glass of hot water with honey and lime in it right after I wake up. I eat in small quantities every two hours and make it a point not to eat anything after 8 P.M. in the evening.","Eating at regular intervals in small amounts and not starving yourself is the key to maintaining your figures.","I would say my legs would be my strength. I think I have the perfect legs."],"Krzysztof Kieslowski":["For me optimism is two lovers walking into the sunset arm in arm. Or maybe into the sunrise - whatever appeals to you.","I have one good characteristic: I'm a pessimist, so I always imagine the worst - always. To me, the future is a black hole.","There are mysteries, secret zones in each individual.","I like chance meetings - life is full of them. Every day, without realising it, I pass people whom I should know.","Different people in different parts of the world can be thinking the same thoughts at the same time. It's an obsession of mine: that different people in different places are thinking the same thing but for different reasons. I try to make films which connect people.","Maybe it is worth investigating the unknown, if only because the very feeling of not knowing is a painful one.","Of course I'd like to get beyond the concrete. But it's really difficult. Very difficult.","In real life, there are names that surprise us because they don't seem to suit the person at all.","The television industry doesn't like to see the compexity of the world. It prefers simple reporting, with simple ideas: this is white, that's black; this is good, that's bad.","To tell you the truth, in my work, love is always in opposition to the elements. It creates dilemmas. It brings in suffering. We can't live with it, and we can't live without it. You'll rarely find a happy ending in my work.","I was happy when I got into film school. I'd simply satisfied my ambition to show them that I could get in - nothing else - although I do believe they shouldn't have accepted me. I was a complete idiot. I can't understand why they took me. Probably because I'd tried three times.","Documentaries deal with people who live real, everyday lives. But if these people trusted us and told us the truth about their lives, it could be used against them - which sometimes happened.","I believe the life of every person is worthy of scrutiny, containing its own secrets and dramas.","Someone knocks at the door of an apartment to borrow salt or sugar, people run into each other in the elevator, and in this way become inscribed in the spectator's memory.","In believing too much in rationality, our contemporaries have lost something.","If I have a goal, then it is to escape from this literalism. I'll never achieve it; in the same way that I'll never manage to describe what really dwells within my character, although I keep on trying.","Do people really want liberty, equality, fraternity? Is it not some manner of speaking?","I have no problem being with people of different nationalities.","We're always looking at this love through the eyes of the person who is suffering because of this love.","I really don't know anything about music, and it's no great experience for me. But I do think that music has a purifying element."],"Ksenia Solo":["I consider myself incredibly lucky to live and work in places like Canada and the U.S. where polio no longer threatens to rob the livelihoods of innocent children. As a young woman, I stand behind the women around the globe who are leading the charge against polio and working relentlessly to achieve a polio-free world.","I was born in Eastern Europe, in Latvia, and I'm fluent in Russian.","It's funny because I'm so used to acting in English that any time I have these moments where I have to speak Russian, it definitely takes a different part of my brain to pull it off, but it's always nice and fun.","I understand the power of the Internet, but I can't say that I'm there. I'm old-fashioned and living in a different century. I don't know. I just don't really understand the craze of it.","'Black Swan' was absolutely unbelievable. I had always dreamed of working with Darren Aronofsky, and Natalie Portman, Winona Ryder, Barbara Hershey, Mila Kunis and Vincent Cassel. The entire cast was really a dream cast, and it was amazing to work with these powerhouse women that I've just admired for so many years.","My mom is actually a former prima ballerina, and all the women in my family are associated either with dance or choreography or acting, so I'm very lucky in a way because I grew up in a family of artists. I've been dancing since I was a little kid.","I always say that I was dancing and acting in the belly. I feel like it's something I was born with and inspired by my family since I grew up backstage, watching them perform. I guess it was just a natural path for me.","I am totally, completely, 100% in love with fashion. I would wear Chanel gowns to the grocery store if I could. I'm a huge fan of Chanel and Versace, and I actually have always dreamed of designing my own line one day.","You really have to stay true to yourself, as cheesy as that sounds. And you cannot take no for an answer, and you have to dream big. I think that's the greatest thing my family ever taught me: if you're going to dream, you have to dream so big.","In places like South Afghanistan, where cultural norms prevent men from entering homes, female vaccinators often make the difference between a closed or opened door."],"Kublai Khan":["Why do you speak to me of the stones? It is only the arch that matters to me.","But which is the stone that supports the bridge?"],"Kumail Nanjiani":["Being a fish out of water is tough, but that's how you evolve.","You can go slow. Allow your dreams and goals to change, but live an intentional life.","Nobody really knows what they're doing. Some are just better at pretending like they do.","In popular culture, there isn't any other conception of Islam and Muslims other than what you see on the news... When you go to a theme park, you see Muslims riding roller coasters and eating ice cream. Why doesn't anybody think of those Muslims when they think of Muslims?","Studio execs were like, ''Lord of the Rings!' People want to see sword-and-dragon-type things!' No, people just want to see great stories. Hollywood always takes the wrong lesson from successes.","Most people don't really do too many things because they're afraid they'll fail. There are people failing all the time, all around you. And nobody is going to notice your failure. Your failure is not going to be so spectacular that people write news stories about it. Your failure will be boring.","I don't want to generalize, but the target audience for a lot of the YouTube people is fairly young - under the age of 16. You still want to know what those people are watching, because I think it's interesting, but sometimes it just makes you feel old.","You really need to have that discipline. It's not even discipline. I just put down these rules. It's not like a vague, 'Motivate yourself!' and do something. It's specific hours set aside every day for certain things.","I'm from a family of doctors, and I think they really wanted me to be a doctor. I even sort of assumed I would be a doctor.","The world is getting smaller. And people are bumping up against people from different parts of the world with very different points of view. The challenge of our time is going to be, how do you allow other points of view to exist within what you traditionally see as your world?","I grew up watching 'Ghostbusters' and 'Knight Rider' and Hot Wheels commercials. When I got to college, having never set foot in America, I knew more American pop-culture references than my friends did.","My mom told us never to reveal that we were Shia in school. You would find out that some other kid was Shiite, and you would whisper, 'Hey,' or you would see someone at the mosque, and you'd be like, 'Hey, that kid's Shiite!' There was a lot of tension, a lot of violence in Karachi between Shiites and Sunnis.","I used to like to come up with inventions because I hated working so much when I had my day job. I thought, 'All I need is a great idea, and I'm out of here.'","I'm a massive rom-com head! Like, every rom-com in the '90s and early 2000s, I've watched.","Stand-up is successful if they laugh. It's unsuccessful if they don't laugh.","If you do a sketch, that's a very short narrative. Stand-up, it's bit-to-bit, minute-long narratives.","When I started working on 'Michael And Michael,' it was my life for three to four months, and then suddenly it's gone.","Wikipedia is kind of weird. I feel it's lame to put up my own page, but I desperately want someone else to do it.","You can get stuck in the trap of reading your YouTube comments all the time. Sometimes I regret it. Not everyone is going to love you. And for some reason, stand-up has this thing where everyone thinks they can do it. So everyone thinks they're an expert.","The worst job I ever had was an office job that I had for six years, and that's nothing against the people who I was surrounded by, because they were wonderful people.","Honestly, I would love to be friends with Fox Mulder on 'The X-Files.' That's almost a little too obvious, but that would be my answer. I'd love to hang out with him.","I never really got into game shows. The easiest one is 'Wheel Of Fortune' because you just have to know words, and for the most part everyone knows words.","When generally people make race-based jokes to me - even if they're not technically racist, they're sort of based on me being Pakistani or whatever - on Twitter, you know, I block a lot of people who say something weird about my name or something. It does bug me generally, but it is all about context.","I think, you know, a lot of the business of comedy is taking your personal experiences and making them relatable to other people.","I've found that the common humanity of people is the most relatable thing, and even if your stories are very specific about a different place, if you have a relatable core of humanity, people will go along with it.","I would say I try to make my comedy really personal. I try to tell stories that happened to me, experiences from my life.","I moved to New York first and was really apprehensive about moving to L.A., but I really, really like it.","I love, love, love the street-cart food. Gyros are like a meat-flavored fruit roll-up. A meat roll-up.","I stay home. It's the best place to be alone. There is hardly any walk-through traffic.","'Four Weddings and a Funeral' is one of my favorite movies, and I laugh all the time, and I cry during the one funeral. But I'll say that 'Monsters, Inc.' is a movie that really gets me super-emotional. Especially the ending.","I thought, from watching TV and stuff, that America was one place. They only show you L.A. and New York. They don't warn you about Iowa.","I want to be so famous that I'm the pop-culture reference that people would make to try and be racist to me. So I'd be walking down the street, and someone would be, like, 'Hey, look at this Kumail Nanjiani.'","I don't go, 'It is now time to change Americans' perception of Muslims. It's going to be a long day.' I think you just try to be unique and try to be yourself, and if something good comes of that, then great.","I've always played some version of a nerdy guy or something like that. I mean, one of my story lines on 'Silicon Valley' is that I am very bad with women!","Rom-coms have been one of my favorite genres of movies since I can remember. My favorite movie of all-time is 'Four Weddings and a Funeral,' and then 'When Harry Met Sally,' and 'Annie Hall' is top five.","I just hope that there's a market for somebody who looks like me as the lead of a rom-com, you know?","Because of the Internet, you're sort of forced to deal with people from very different backgrounds and beliefs. It's a great challenge of our time, and depending on when you ask me, I feel optimistic or pessimistic about it.","I always felt that it was never the duty of a person to really stand up for their gender or their race or anything like that - I always felt that was a personal choice. But I do feel now that maybe my opinion is evolving or changing a little bit.","I'm still trying to figure out how to have an adult relationship with my parents.","One of my favorite comedies is 'Shaun of the Dead.'","I'll tell you, nobody was more excited than me, in the entire world, that there is a 'Silicon Valley' Funko set.","I started a podcast about 'X-Files' and ended up on it. Then I started a podcast about video games, and I'm in the new 'Mass Effect' game. I have to pick the stuff I love and do a podcast on it.","I started doing standup because of Hugh Grant's best-man speech in 'Four Weddings,' which is basically a standup routine.","You just don't see Muslims being matter-of-fact Muslim. They're always defined by their Muslim-ness. We're either terrorists, or we're fighting terrorists. I remember seeing 'True Lies' and going, 'Why are we always the bad guys?'","I never decided I wanted to be an actor. I just started doing standup because I love standup. Everything else has sort of been these tiny steps leading to this.","I know a lot of brown actors who play terrorists because they're physically intimidating. For me, it was like, 'O.K., you'll be the nerd.' So I've played the nerd. I've played food-delivery guys. But I always tried to find something in the characters so that they weren't just defined by what they looked like.","A lot of times, it seems like social media has devolved into people just yelling at each other and not really conversing.","Think about when you were 12 or 13. The stuff I watched was awful! I tried to watch a 'He-Man' cartoon recently, and I was like, 'Oh my God!' I just had, like, a small brain. I was stupid.","Populate your life with people different from you. Once you leave school, you get to choose the kinds of people you're going to be around rather than forced to be around them.","I was actually looking at the poster for 'Tarzan,' and I was thinking how abs look so different now. These are not your grandma's abs. They go so deep and so sharp now.","I'd love to be in action movies. I've been trying to convince people. I don't think it's anything physical holding me back. I think it's a general vibe thing that's holding me back. I don't project action confidence, maybe.","I loved the Oscars, and I had V.H.S. tapes for the Oscars, and I used to watch them over and over. There was probably one year where I watched it, like, 20 times or something.","TV requires a lot more patience. No one's ever like, 'I gotta get up at 5 A.M. and write my stand-up!' It's an easy life. With 'Silicon Valley,' it's long hours and very unglamorous.","I know what is funny coming out of my mouth and what is not funny coming out of my mouth. You have to figure out, What is the joke that I can do that nobody else can do?","When I was studying comedy in Chicago, it wasn't long after 9/11. There were a lot Middle Eastern comedians who were doing bits about hailing cabs and being terrorists. So the first two years, I didn't do any of that because I wanted to separate myself from those guys. But race is a big part of who I am, and it should be a big part of my comedy.","I have a reward-and-punishment system: If I have done this much work, then I can play video games this long. It gives my day structure.","A lot of people say video games can be stifling. Older people say, 'We had to go outside, and we had to make up stories!' For me, video games broadened my horizons. Playing 'Golden Axe,' I was those characters. I imagined myself being in that world, so honestly, it was a really good thing.","Most of my exposure to American pop culture was through this weird prism of 'Mad' magazine.","I didn't know if I could be funny on stage or write a joke. But I saw that there are no rules. If you're funny offstage, you can figure out a way to be funny onstage.","My parents don't really understand my career. They don't really bring it up that much.","I was not a cool kid. There was no reason for me to be marginalised. I was just a nerd. I was kind of weird, and I found solace in video games.","I remember my jaw would hurt because I wasn't used to speaking English all the time. Like how, even if you exercise, you'll play kickball one day, and then you're like, 'Wait, I run, but new places are hurting because I don't use my muscles this way.' My mouth was not used to making these sounds.","I had this very strict rule when I began auditioning that I wasn't gonna do a thicker accent, because it was like, 'I can't tell if it's supposed to be funny because he talks funny.' And now I feel like there are certain characters that I could play that could involve doing a thicker accent, as long as it's specific to that character.","My parents aren't the demographic for a lot of things I do. If I did a stand-up show, and I saw 62-year-old Pakistanis in the crowd, I'd be like, 'I'm gonna bomb.'","Living in Pakistan, you didn't have a sense of how huge and varied America was geographically. I had visited once. I thought of it as this crazy, happy, exciting place where everybody's rich, and there's stuff everywhere. Compared to Pakistan, it's not untrue. Compared to Pakistan, the streets are paved with gold.","I still don't have a real appreciation for music because I didn't really start listening to it until my 20s. My wife knows everything about music, and I try and get her to educate me, but it's just not part of my DNA.","The plan was always to come to America, because Pakistan's a scary place. They don't have religious freedom. It's very poor, and there's a lot of violence and corruption.","My favorite writer on 'The X-Files' is this guy Darin Morgan. He wrote my favorite episode and the top five favorite episodes that everyone loves.","It happens to people. People ruin things they love! I'm sure the guy who played Jar Jar Binks loved 'Star Wars.'","There was one week where I got mistaken for Hasan Minhaj, who is on 'The Daily Show;' Kunal Nayyar, who's on 'Big Bang Theory;' and Karan Soni of 'Ghostbusters.' This was one week."],"Kumar Mangalam Birla":["Well, I think the golden rule I can think of is the fact that you must follow your passion and do something that's close to your heart. And I think that that's very important, well, to be successful and to be happy.","I think a leader has many roles to play. So, you know, one role is that of incubating talent; the other is that of being a strategist. It's a very interesting job I've got.","The work environment is very important in determining how enjoyable work is. It is very important to work with smart guys who have a superior level of intellectual bandwidth and still have softer skills as well.","First create jobs, and then provide skills to people.","It's not a good idea to always look for new frontiers, especially when you have opportunities in your existing businesses, in your own backyard.","The one important factor that keeps me going is the kind of people I work with.","I was very fortunate, because I don't think many people get to spend time with their great-grandfathers. So, he passed away when I was 15, so I spent a lot of time with him. We lived together. He traveled a lot, but when he was here, we lived together.","In 1991, the government unleashed the power of India and created a partnership between itself and industry. As a result, India has emerged as an economic success story, and that is a matter of pride for all of us.","One feels very blessed to be born into a family like the Birla family, which is a household name in India, which stands for tradition, is yet contemporary, stands for trust.","Being a conglomerate, each of our businesses has a different challenge; business landscape is different for each business. It makes it challenging as well as exciting.","The License Raj in India was a time when, to set up an industry, you needed a license. Which made the government an omnipresent and sort of all-pervasive authority.","My father taught us that to thrive, excellence in technology, quality, and customer service along with cost competitiveness is a prerequisite. His contribution to business, the economy, and society at large can never be underscored enough.","I don't think the western world is questioning capitalism. Capitalism as a concept is not something that society has written off. But today, there is degree of caution around capitalism. We believe in compassionate capitalism. Growth for growth's sake can never be an end in itself.","The culture of caring and giving permeates many Indian families. In their own way, they are engaged in philanthropic pursuits.","Very often, we think of leadership being at the very top of an organisation. I think what's unique about ABG is that we have a very strong cadre of leaders across the organisation who are highly empowered and therefore play a very major role in the growth and evolution of the organization.","Jack Welch is someone who I have always admired. In India, Narayana Murthy is someone who I have great respect for."],"Kumar Pallana":["I'm an old guy. I don't hustle and I don't bustle. So sometimes you're behind, but that's okay. Your peace of mind is more important. I have seen the people who hustle and bustle, and they are already gone, at a young age. They could have enjoyed life.","I want more job. I want to die entertaining.","My father lost his business. Our house was locked up, and we had to leave.","To make the people happy, to forget their problems. Then, to me, I'm doing my job. But to act is a God gift.","Each of us has our own destiny. Mine is to be an actor."],"Kunal Nayyar":["Comic-Con has been an amazing experience. It's overwhelming, I have to admit, because of the lines and the crowds.","I would definitely line up for 'The Lord of the Rings.' I'm a huge 'Lord of the Rings' geek.","People at the University of Portland were accepting and loving and open-minded. When you have a safety net, it allows you to take risks.","I was pretty awkward when I was young, but I was never afraid of putting myself out there. I would say stupid things but then they would laugh at me and possibly find it endearing.","When we first started 'The Big Bang Theory,' I would get incredibly nervous because it's such a big show and I was just out of graduate school. I'd come in and have this huge responsibility for the one line that everyone hopes will bring down the house.","I'm helping launch the new Milky Way Chocolate Ice Cream Bar. I play an astrophysicist on television, and the name of the bar is Milky Way, so put two and two together, and here I am.","We live in a bubble sometimes, and you can get out of touch with your fans. You go to the studio, you come home. But coming to Comic-Con is a real opportunity to connect with the people that made your show happen and are responsible for its continued success. It's really humbling.","I'm obsessed with 'Game of Thrones.' I love comedies - I really like '30 Rock' and 'Modern Family.'","These characters, they have to evolve. They're getting older on the show, these are things that happen in everyone's life. People do get married... this is just a natural evolution. I wonder if we'll have 'Big Bang' babies in the season finale?","I'm a pro! No, what I mean is I have performed with the Royal Shakespeare Company in England. I have been all over the place. I have studied theatre for seven years.","No one ever sees the sleepless nights, the years of studying and 14-hour days earning your dues. I spent three years isolated in an academic environment to be the best actor I could.","I have a dialect myself; it's more pronounced, because I have studied theatre and been in England. It's half-British, half-Indian.","Sometimes I'll be sitting with my friends; I'll say something Koothrappali-esque and make a face. There is a lot of Koothrappali in me as a human being. A lot of mannerism, humor, mischievousness, my innocence. So I don't know if I bring him home so much as I bring myself to him at work.","I really think if you take away a character's obstacles then there's no comedy.","I love going to the G4 sci-fi-type parties.","I have a fear of heights and I'm claustrophobic.","I like to work as much as I can, but I only really have the hiatus to work on other projects. I've kept myself busy recently. I voiced a character in 'Ice Age 4,' which was a lot of fun. I also did another small movie called 'The Scribbler.'","I went to the University/Resident Theatre Association auditions. Deans come and watch you in this theater. You have three minutes, and you have to do two contrasting monologues - at that time, this is 2003 - one classical and one contemporary.","It all started with the most basic level of Uta Hagen, right at the beginning. I'm like, 'Really? I came to grad school; I'm going to do the 'Respect for Acting'?' And I realized the importance of that, because it was really to just get you to get rid of everything. Get rid of everything you've learned and just start from the bottom up.","I did learn that there's no point in eating too much Vitamin C because it comes out of your bladder.","I know stuff about 'Lord of the Rings' and 'Star Wars,' but 'Star Trek,' I don't know.","If you want to go on the floor, go in disguise because otherwise you won't be able to. I would just put on a full Darth Vader costume and walk through Comic-Con so I can actually check it out and enjoy it as opposed to being approached by everyone, which is lovely, but it gets very difficult to enjoy because there's so many people there.","When you move from a different country, it takes a while to make friends. I found myself being lonely a lot at first. In New Delhi, I had all my family. But Portland is one of those cities you can immerse yourself in and feel comfortable. People are so friendly.","I love video games. I love, love, love them! I also love 'Star Wars.' I wish Jedi was a true religion.","Comic-Con fans are so affectionate, and it's always a lovely way to start a new season.","The really good stand up comedians can be angry but relatable, and they have interestingly humanizing personalities. Their observational skills are far greater than mine, so I'll just stick to reading lines off a page."],"Kuno Becker":["Cinco de Mayo is an important day. The Mexicans had to defend themselves from the French. It is historically significant, but it is not Mexican Independence Day.","It's a lot tougher to play soccer and make it look believable. But in boxing, it was easier for me. I got injured a lot more in the soccer world. In soccer, I pulled muscles. I thought boxing was going to be tougher.","When you punch somebody in the ring, you have to use your whole body. I learned that it's more about technique than physical strength.","I've been doing mostly independent films, and things like 'Goal' give me a chance to have more options."],"Kurt Andersen":["I often set two alarm clocks because I'm afraid the first one won't actually make me get up.","Anything remotely resembling news media is going to continue to migrate online until very little or none of it is produced on dead trees.","The mistrust of government that blossomed in the late '60s has become a chronic and in some ways pathological condition.","I think we tend to be kind of ahistorical, and think that life as we are living it in the moment is all we know.","Once a decade, once every eight years, Donald Trump finds some pretext to say I suck and that I'm bad."],"Kurt Angle":["When Jack Swagger copies my Ankle Lock and Randy Orton does my Angle Slam, it's disrespectful. I didn't come up with the Ankle Lock; Ken Shamrock came up with the Ankle Lock, but I waited until he retired to do the Ankle Lock.","You do not boo an Olympic Gold Medalist. I'm the best in the world. I came here for you. You don't boo me.","You go from Olympic wrestling into pro wrestling, and it's a very difficult transition, but if you make it, you can earn a great living while at the same time giving amateur wrestling a lot of exposure by being on TV every week. Fans know where you came from.","Join me in Olympic Heros for Abstinence. The best sex is no sex.","In Canada, you can't even have a barbecue in your backyard without being attacked by a moose or even a grizzly bear. Then again, the grizzlies don't beat anyone here in Vancouver; oh, it's true, it's true.","The cool thing about pro wrestling is we do a lot more acting as far as characters in general than MMA. I know a lot of people like the MMA fighters because they like the rugged look.","It took me a few years to explain to my colleagues and my mentors and the people that I looked up to and I wrestled that I'm not in wrestling anymore. I'm in sports entertainment. Pro' wrestling doesn't mean that we're saying we're a step up above amateur wrestling, because there's nothing above Olympic wrestling.","My true love is with amateur wrestlin;, that's where I was born. I've always wanted to wrestle.","There are many young Americans that are very distant from our political process.","I'm not going to be a guy that retires and keeps coming back. When I'm gone, I'm gone. Same thing as amateur wrestling; when I won the world championships in Olympics, I left and I never went back. Same for pro.","I've been chastised for going into mixed martial arts and backing out. But the reason I backed out was the terms - they wanted me ready to fight in four weeks, but you've got to be out of your mind. So I decided to go back to my roots, back to wrestling.","You've got to stay in pretty good shape to be a pro wrestler, and all the TNA wrestlers get a bit nervous when I wrestle them because they're afraid I'll tire them out, but the Olympics is a whole different level.","I don't like to have gimmicks. I don't like to have gadgets and stuff. I just like to go out there and entertain the fans by wrestling.","I love doing funny promos like the ones I did wrestling Rey Mysterio.","Pro wrestling is not fake; it's sports entertainment. We go out there and we perform, and a lot of what we do out there is real, but we're not going to insult anyone's intelligence - there is a predetermined winner. It's just the fans don't know who it is, and that's what makes it so intriguing.","Believe it or not, I kind of went into professional wrestling so I could get an avenue into acting.","The hard part for me was being an Olympic gold medalist and having that persona; you don't see too many Olympic gold medalists go into acting. It's actually even more difficult. You're not taken very seriously, and you're looked at in a different light, so it was kind of hard for me to go straight from Olympics into acting.","Pro wrestling was there, and I was good at it, thank God. I started getting a lot of offers, but unfortunately, at WWE I was under a tight leash. I think it had a lot to do with The Rock making the transition, and me possibly being the next guy - you know, the company didn't want to lose another top performer.","I really have been trying to get in movies with smaller parts, just to get myself in there and get more practice, and not have to take the big lead. In 'Dylan Dog' I was one of the co-stars, and I had a pretty good part in that movie.","Wrestling is such a competitive sport worldwide.","There are so many things that have evolved since I wrestled. They don't have periods anymore. They have rounds... it confuses the younger demographic.","Wrestlers in the U.S.A. are very aggressive. All they want to do is attack, but they'll make mistakes.","I love Vince McMahon. He came up with the Kurt Angle character. He ran with it, and then I was able to run with it. I thank him for the opportunity he gave me. Vince McMahon was one of my best friends, period.","I'm in professional wrestling, which is what I do for a living. I coordinate stunts. I memorize them.","Amateur wrestling, you can go by instinct. Pro wrestling, you have to memorize, and you have to go by what moves you said you were going to do. Sometimes you have to feel the crowd and do the moves at the right time and know the timing and tell a good story.","The Olympics is not really about the sport, it's about the story behind the person. You keep the sport relatively simple to understand - let the fans understand that a takedown is 1 point, a turn is 2, a pin and the match is over. Keep it simple, and keep the story on the individual.","I teased Randy Orton because he started using my finish, the Angle Slam. I said, 'Hey, I don't mind you using it, but at least give it a name.' When he hits it, the announcers just say, 'Well, he just hit that... thing.'","We take pride in making our Knockouts Division about wrestling, not about looking pretty."],"Kurt Bills":["The reality is that we are all economists. We all deal with scarcity as we make choices and calculate how to ration various items and resources that we consume, produce and utilize.","Having parents who were hard working, blue collar, and staunchly independent, neither political party's positioning really impressed me.","It's time to take Economics 101 to Washington. We believe in liberty, we believe in limited government, we believe in free enterprise, we believe in family values and the sanctity of human life, and we all believe Washington needs a good dose of Economics 101.","Since scarcity is the basic economic problem, if it does not exist then there is no reason for my economics course. Devoting time to the study of how people use limited resources to fulfill unlimited wants and needs should help us to discover how to best utilize the resources we have at our disposal.","Discovering various economists, economic works, reading financial periodicals and keeping up on current events in geopolitics and economics around the world opened my eyes to many facets of how the extended order works.","My hope is that people begin to understand what the fiscal realities are - how economic virtue differs from political virtue - and develop a realization of their individual economic philosophy in comparison to their perceived political ideology.","The young people I teach now know they are being sold down the river before we even start studying the trends and numbers. That's the toughest part of being a high school economics teacher... being a witness when our children realize that the greatest deficit of all is a deficit of leadership.","In Minnesota, we hold our leaders to a higher standard. We demand that the men and women we send to Washington stand above reproach and steer clear of the web of corruption, kickbacks and special favors.","We believe in liberty, we believe in limited government, we believe in free enterprise, we believe in family values and the sanctity of human life, and we all believe Washington needs a good dose of Economics 101."],"Kurt Braunohler":["In my new IFC comedy game show, 'Bunk,' we actually use our intern Patrick as a human timer - giving contestants the time it takes for him to wade through a bag of broken glass for a razor blade, to get gum out of his hair, to pick up every strand from a box of spaghetti I spill on the floor, etc, etc.","So much of existence is so boring. To have little moments of stupidity is always welcome.","'Bunk' is better than 'Wheel of Fortune' because we have a wheel, just like them, but our wheel is purposeless. It doesn't do anything. It just spins for no reason. Which is nice because it frees our wheel up to really pursue its dream: becoming a professional paddlewheel.","It is true that I do not wear shoes as the host of 'Bunk.' I want 'Bunk' to feel like there's a slight possibility that a confident homeless man just wondered into the studio and started hosting a game show.","I would love to be more specific, but really, any type of bird is the funniest animal. They have to move awkwardly when walking. They have beady eyes; they are very suspicious. They can't do anything right. They have no hands, which is inherently funny.","There's this secret Korean taco/cupcake truck I go to. To find it, you have to bring a hard-boiled egg to this deli in Bushwick where they give you the address.","For people who mourn for old Times Square - hey, there's a ton of places in the city still like that! Get on the train and go visit them!","New York is a place that can grind you down and spit you out. A true New Yorker doesn't get ground down - he gets polished.","The rules of game shows limit stuff so much. I remember on 'Money From Strangers,' being in the van - not even performing - and there was a lawyer there the entire time. 'No, you can't give money for that. Yes, you can give money for that. That's a partial answer. That's a full answer.'","For a really long time in my life, I fought against how I look. Because I was raised Catholic in school, where everyone had to wear a suit and tie. I hated everything that stood for. And I realized when I walked down the street, everyone would see the guy I hated and not the guy I was.","For a long time, I dressed like an idiot. In college, I had a fully shaved head with just two horns. Like, a coxcomb of hair that I would sculpt into two horns. I looked like a crazy person.","A lot of improvisers mistakenly assume stand-up is awful, because there are a lot of stand-ups in the world that did not appeal to me. It was so easy to make a blanket statement when I was improvising only: 'Stand-up's terrible.' It's so ignorant and stupid to do that. But it's easy to do that. So that's where I came from.","Other than Caroline's in New York, I pretty much haven't done clubs. That was primarily because I always liked the people and audiences at theaters and bars better.","It is an intern's job to go for coffee for anyone who asks, preferably delivering it scalding hot and cupped in your bare hands!","All the great game show hosts have a signature 'look,' from Bob Barker's year-round Brazil Nut-hued tan to Monty Hall's oversized lamb chop sideburns. As the host of IFC's new comedy game show 'Bunk,' I, too, have worked to develop a style signature by being the first man or woman in TV history to host every show in my bare feet!","People have said that to me: They say I have a TV face.","It used to be if you wanted to be a comedian, you used to just do sets. You'd go up three times a night, just get better, and then some people would see you and you'd do 'The Tonight Show,' and then boom, you're a comedian.","I pushed against doing a podcast for so long. I'm a very late comer to the podcast game. But you're responsibility as a comedian is to get your viewpoints out into the world, and we have a lot more avenues to do that. So it's a lot more opportunity, but really have to work all the time.","In doing my podcast, I do find that I tend to try out bits that I then try on stage later that day. If they work, great, and if they don't, I regret having talked about it on the podcast.","Auditions are just torture. I'm trying to get better at it. It's a very difficult thing to do. You go into a tiny room with a camera with somebody who is doing this with 100 other people, and they're so bored, and then you have to be like, 'Hey! I'm gonna show you what I got!'","There are a billion songs that I've heard and said, 'I don't even care to have an opinion about it,' but if I have to hear a snippet of the refrain of 'We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together' once, it'll get stuck in my head, and that drives me crazy.","You don't become a fully-formed human as a female, or even a male, until you're at least 30.","Who would want to get back together with Taylor Swift after having dated her? I'm sure dating her is like talking to a white sheet of paper with a little bit of vanilla ice cream on it that doesn't say anything.","Everyone wants something that'll appeal to, like, 13-year-olds to 18-year-olds. Especially working in television and trying to pitch shows, they're like, 'We definitely want something that a 14-year-old will be, like, super-psyched about.' And I'm like, 'I don't know if my reality is appealing to a 14-year-old.'","We are going to do 'Hot Tub' until we die. Every Monday. Then we'll come back and do it as zombies. 'Hot Tub' is very important. What we do is based on our live skills. It's stand-up and sketch and improv; everything we do in 'Hot Tub' is important to our jobs. And every Monday I'm excited to do it.","Eric Bryant and Ethan Berlin, the creators of 'Bunk,' asked me to come get involved in very early process when they wanted to make a game show.","I want to continually find ways to bring my ideas off the stage and into the real world, into the streets. I think I can make the world a better place, if only for a little while.","The entire New York comedy scene has moved to L.A. - it's bled the New York comedy scene dry.","It's amazing how much people talk about colonics here. That's not a thing anywhere else in the country. But I totally did a juice cleanse, I did a colonic - I'm getting into L.A. living!","I was writing this really long joke about the smell of poop, and I was like, 'What am I doing with my life?' I started to think about why I was a comedian, and then I came up with a reason for existence, which is: inserting absurdity or stupidity into strangers' lives in order to make the world a better place.","I never understood using Kickstarter for commercial purposes. If you want to raise money for commercial purposes, I think you should give someone a dividend. They make money, then you make money. It should be an investment, whereas I think Kickstarter's true purpose is raising money for things that are in and of themselves justifying.","I think we get stuck in routines so easily that when an absurd moment in life seems to be there for no reason, it wakes you up out of your everyday pattern. You pull back and look at life a little bit wider because of that one weird thing you weren't expecting.","'Bunk' is a comedy game show where, each week, three of my favorite comedians compete in a series of bizarre and meaningless challenges all for my entertainment. Ethan T. Berlin and Eric Bryant created 'Bunk.'","Anyone can become a game show host. It simply requires a giant, narcissistic ego and an inability to do anything else. The closest thing to school I did was looking in the mirror one hundred times a day and repeating, 'People should listen to you talk.'","For a long time, I would go out of my way to have a personal appearance on the verge of an insane person, because it was closer to how I felt, but I looked so dumb. So, I just stopped. It was like, 'I'm just going to look like a banker.'","My parents got divorced when I was 2, so I have this weird thing where I have 8 brothers and sisters, but I am also an only child.","The feeling of being an outsider was a big part of my childhood. I think that helps comedians. That feeling of being an outsider. That desire for a perspective that's all your own. The idea for me to make stuff myself with my own meaning came from that as well.","When I moved to New York at 22, I didn't know what I wanted to do. I took an improv class, and the first scene I did, I felt like 'I want to do this for the rest of my life.' It was the first time I ever felt like that about anything. I tried to make a living off improv.","Every day I do one or two podcasts that 92 percent of people never will hear. I'm constantly producing, constantly making jokes for Twitter. There's a lot of pressure there. On the flip side, I think having to produce like that makes you a better comedian.","I go on Wikipedia and alter pages of animals with fake facts that I've made up about those animals.","I grew up very Catholic. I wanted to be a priest."],"Kurt Browning":["Doing shows is always a side of skating that I've loved, it's the performing. I get to do that without the pressure, it's always fun between the skaters and the preparation, the show is always so much fun.","I love how my sport reaches out to people with the music and story lines, the glory of standing up for three or four minutes of tough, arduous, gravity-defying skating and all the stuff that goes with it.","I have been performing and touring and doing shows all over the world. But it's really something special to get back on the U.S. cast of 'Stars on Ice.' It's something I let go because of family commitments.","Michael Weiss and Todd Eldredge and I all competed against each other. Even though I'm older than them, we did cross over a little bit.","Four world titles is a good swath at the top of the podium. The Olympics didn't work out for a couple of reasons, but it feels good when people say 'four world titles.'","What I really wanted was to perform. So if it took four world titles or one Olympic medal, I just wanted so badly to be able to perform. So it doesn't hinder me sleeping at night that I don't have an Olympic medal."],"Kurt Busch":["You know, it's just a matter of working through the pitfalls sometimes and working through the challenges that lie ahead.","You really don't put a value on your first win, it is priceless no matter where you are.","I just always dreamed of racing cars, but I didn't think I could do it as a living.","Each driver has their own identity and from one week to another, normally it stays the same.","I feel comfortable around every driver out there and each driver is in charge of their own car, but you feel very secure racing the competition out there.","Newman and I were friends. We were great teammates, and he needs to check his trophy case on that Daytona 500 trophy I helped him get years ago.","The Daytona 500 is a big race, and Darlington is just as big of an event, and a lot of people get excited for it.","I've been fined probably more than any driver, and I've probably paid it out of my own pocket more than any driver.","This 51 Phoenix Racing team, I love them to death. They've got my back, I've got theirs.","I know where my priorities lie.","There are going to be little victories that we claim, even if it's finishing 15th and putting the car back in hauler without a scratch on it.","This is like my dad's race team where we had one Legend car. If we wrecked it, we couldn't race the next week unless we had enough parts to put it back together again.","So there is going to be that balance of understanding how to get the best out of the car that day, whether it's 15th or even if I have a shot at a top 10, protecting that car so we can bring it back when we have to.","It's almost therapeutic driving there and driving back (to North Carolina), with the time you get to think about things as well as create checklists.","I'm technologically challenged, so I finally hooked up Bluetooth in my truck so I can talk going down the road.","It's just that fun atmosphere, working on the car, being with the guys. This is exactly what I needed.","Just a ton of excitement, and the way the guys are together on this, they're looking at me to grow and to learn, and I'm looking at them to grow and to learn.","James Finch is exactly what I'm looking for, as far as getting back into the race car to have fun.","James Finch has always had pretty stout cars for the restrictor-plate races and I know we'll be very competitive at Daytona.","There's steps that I've taken already, and each week, talking with the sports psychologist on a routine basis and working with the different programs that we're going through. This is all stuff that you can say you're going to make a difference, but I'm putting it into action.","I am grateful to Penske Racing for six very productive years. Together we won a lot of races - 16 in all. I'm proud that we won on a variety of tracks.","I also appreciate the lasting friendships I've made while working with our great sponsors through the years, including Miller Lite, Shell and Dodge.","Over the Thanksgiving holiday I took time to reflect on what is most important to me and realized I need to find a way to put the fun back into racing.","Leaving a great organization and a lucrative contract is not easy, but it allows me to take a deep breath and work on things that can make me a better driver and a better person.","That's what race fans love to see. That's what they bought this ticket for. That's what they're sitting in the grandstands rooting on their favorite driver for is to see him get out there, mix it up clean and bring it home just like we were, third and fourth.","What we do is just race hard on the track every week. That's the way I'd like it to be documented, and if we watch the tape, we'll see that the No. 48 swerved into us first and I know that, before even watching the tape.","That's what I try to do each and every week is give my best effort and not give up, no matter what comes at us.","I feel like we're a very good top-10 car, but we really have to work hard and find a unique way to get these top fives.","Is my strike zone bigger than others? Yeah. It might be bigger than others, but I don't have a problem with it.","This is fun. This is entertainment, right guys?","When Jimmie Johnson goes out early and finishes 35th, as he did Sunday, he can look at the cameras, lament about it being a tough day, and then say, 'We'll just try to get them next week at Darlington.'"],"Kurt Busiek":["I love creator-owned comics. Most of my favorite books these days are creator-owned, from stuff DC publishes, like 'Fables,' to books like 'Saga,' 'Fatale,' 'Hellboy,' and 'Courtney Crumrin.'","I don't view Twitter as a promotional tool but as a really, really, really cool cocktail party.","I like superheroes. I like the drama of it, the stirring, larger-than-life aspect.","At one point, I worked up a list of five requirements for a superhero: superpowers, a costume, a code name, a mission, and a milieu. If the character had three out of the five, they were a superhero. But that's just my definition.","I'm a writer. I just love telling stories.","I wrote 'Marvels,' which was about a guy who had two daughters, and I wrote 'Astro City Volume 2 #1,' which was about a guy who had two daughters. In both cases, about a year and a half or two years apart. And then after that, I had two daughters, about a year and a half or two years apart.","That's the way it happens - some characters you set out to use, some are happy accidents. As long as it works, it doesn't really matter how you got them.","Theme is great for people who like to approach stories that way, but it's an organizing principle that helps us write a story that has some weight; it's not something that all readers have to care about.","Between 'Avengers,' 'JLA/Avengers,' and 'Trinity,' I've gotten down and dirty in the big universes and had a hell of a time playing in those sandboxes.","I wanted to be a writer, but the idea of writing novels or movies seemed really intimidating. I never got more than a few pages into one.","When I realized that people actually wrote comics, that it was a job people could do, I thought, 'Gee, these things are only 17 pages long! I could probably finish one of those and find out whether I suck before I've spent five years of my life on it.' In stumbling into comics that way, I discovered that I loved the form.","I could name you a dozen superheroes whose powers I'd like to have. But if I could have any power in the world, it would be the power to read or watch a creative work and absorb the technical skill of the people who made it. Because then I could have even more fun writing. That's my core identity. I'm a writer. I just love telling stories.","When you have a novel set in a fictional history, you still should get your history right.","The reason I quit being a sales manager over twenty years now is because I hate elevator pitches. I want to write stories and show people what's in them when they read them, not tell them all about it ahead of time.","You've got to leave the reader with more than just a name and a costume - they need to know who the character is, what they're like, what kind of attitude they have, what sort of role they play.","I created lots of characters in high school and college, and the first character I created in pro comics was Liana, Green Lantern of M'Elu, for a backup story in 'Green Lantern #162,' my first professional sale.","The most fascinating powers don't mean a thing if the guy's poorly motivated or dull, and the most generic powers won't hurt a well-motivated character. Personality and motivation are what make Magneto, Magneto and not Cosmic Boy. The powers work for him, but it's his motivation that makes him the character he is.","Marvel's got a crowded universe, and there are already so many characters hogging the spotlight that it's hard to break through that. First off, whatever character you're creating, odds are, there's already someone similar in one way or another.","Mainly, what I like to do is keep things varied and not get in a rut, not tell the same stories over and over.","I tend to think that the best face of humanity is that we learn. We explore, we study, we think.","Dracula, if he could see modern corporations, wouldn't like them much. He took care of his people, at least as he saw it. They had very little freedom, but they had a protector."],"Kurt Cobain":["The duty of youth is to challenge corruption.","I'd rather be hated for who I am, than loved for who I am not.","It's okay to eat fish because they don't have any feelings.","Wanting to be someone else is a waste of the person you are.","If it's illegal to rock and roll, throw my ass in jail!","If you die you're completely happy and your soul somewhere lives on. I'm not afraid of dying. Total peace after death, becoming someone else is the best hope I've got.","My body is damaged from music in two ways. I have a red irritation in my stomach. It's psychosomatic, caused by all the anger and the screaming. I have scoliosis, where the curvature of your spine is bent, and the weight of my guitar has made it worse. I'm always in pain, and that adds to the anger in our music.","Rather be dead than cool.","A friend is nothing but a known enemy.","I was looking for something a lot heavier, yet melodic at the same time. Something different from heavy metal, a different attitude.","Punk is musical freedom. It's saying, doing and playing what you want. In Webster's terms, 'nirvana' means freedom from pain, suffering and the external world, and that's pretty close to my definition of Punk Rock.","I bought a gun and chose drugs instead.","I don't blame the average seventeen-year-old punk-rock kid for calling me a sellout. I understand that. And maybe when they grow up a little bit, they'll realize there's more things to life than living out your rock & roll identity so righteously.","Drugs are a waste of time. They destroy your memory and your self-respect and everything that goes along with with your self-esteem. They're no good at all.","I like to complain and do nothing to make things better.","The sun is gone, but I have a light.","I really haven't had that exciting of a life. There are a lot of things I wish I would have done, instead of just sitting around and complaining about having a boring life. So I pretty much like to make it up. I'd rather tell a story about somebody else.","The worst crime is faking it.","I'm not well-read, but when I read, I read well.","I never wanted to sing. I just wanted to play rhythm guitar - hide in the back and just play.","I'm a spokesman for myself. It just so happens that there's a bunch of people that are concerned with what I have to say. I find that frightening at times because I'm just as confused as most people. I don't have the answers for anything.","If you ever need anything please don't hesitate to ask someone else first.","We have no right to express an opinion until we know all of the answers.","There's nothing better than having a baby. I've always loved children. I used to work summers at the YMCA and be in charge of, like, 30 preschool kids. I knew that when I had a child, I'd be overwhelmed, and it's true... I can't tell you how much my attitude has changed since we've got Frances. Holding my baby is the best drug in the world.","I've never been a very prolific person, so when creativity flows, it flows. I find myself scribbling on little notepads and pieces of loose paper, which results in a very small portion of my writings to ever show up in true form.","Looking back on the production of 'Nevermind,' I'm embarrassed by it now. It's closer to a Motley Crue record than it is a punk rock record.","We're so trendy we can't even escape ourselves.","I like to make people feel happy and superior in their reaction towards my appearance.","Rap music is the only vital form of music introduced since punk rock.","Ever since the beginning of rock and roll, there's been an Axl Rose. And it's just boring. It's totally boring to me.","I have to admit I've found myself doing the same things that a lot of other rock stars do or are forced to do. Which is not being able to respond to mail, not being able to keep up on current music, and I'm pretty much locked away a lot. The outside world is pretty foreign to me.","John Lennon was definitely my favorite Beatle, hands down.","I like guitars in the Fender style because they have skinny necks.","I've always wanted male friends that I could be real intimate with and talk about important things with and be as affectionate with that person as I would be with a girl.","I get a thrill meeting kids who are into alternative music.","Throughout my life, I've always been really close with girls and made friends with girls. And I've always been a really sickly, feminine person anyhow, so I thought I was gay for a while because I didn't find any of the girls in my high school attractive at all.","I'm so happy because today I found my friends - they're in my head.","I've had this terrible stomach problem for years, and that has made touring difficult. People would see me sitting in the corner by myself looking sick and gloomy. The reason is that I was trying to fight against the stomach pain, trying to hold my food down. People looked me and assumed I was some kind of addict.","I like to have strong opinions with nothing to back them up with besides my primal sincerity. I like sincerity. I lack sincerity.","I really miss being able to blend in with people.","I started being really proud of the fact that I was gay even though I wasn't.","I had a really good childhood up until I was nine, then a classic case of divorce really affected me.","I definitely feel closer to the feminine side of the human being than I do the male - or the American idea of what a male is supposed to be. Just watch a beer commercial and you'll see what I mean.","When I listen to 'Nevermind,' I hate the production, but there's something about it that almost makes me cry at times.","I sing and play the guitar, and I'm a walking, talking bacterial infection.","I wanted to have the adoration of John Lennon but have the anonymity of Ringo Starr. I didn't want to be a frontman. I just wanted to be back there and still be a rock and roll star at the same time.","I'm too busy acting like I'm not Naive. I've seen it all, I was here first.","If I wouldn't have found Courtney, I probably would have carried on with a bisexual lifestyle.","I'm really interested in smells. I think I'd like to own a perfumery someday.","I've always had a problem with the average macho man - they've always been a threat to me.","I didn't know how to deal with success. If there was a Rock Star 101, I would have liked to take it. It might have helped me.","I thought I would try to be gay for a while, but I'm just more sexually attracted to women. But I'm really glad that I found a few gay friends, because it totally saved me from becoming a monk or something.","I'm left-handed, and it's not very easy to find reasonably priced, high-quality left-handed guitars. But out of all the guitars in the whole world, the Fender Mustang is my favorite. I've only owned two of them.","Every time I see documentaries or infomercials about little kids with cancer, I just freak out. It affects me on the highest emotional level... Anytime I think about it, it makes me sadder than anything I can think of.","My mother encouraged me to be artistic. It was written in a contract at an early age that I would be an artist.","Out of all the guitars in the whole world, the Fender Mustang is my favorite. They're cheap and totally inefficient, and they sound like crap and are very small.","I won't eat anything green.","When I heard the Pixies for the first time, I connected with that band so heavily I should have been in that band - or at least in a Pixies cover band.","My songs have always been frustrating themes, relationships that I've had. And now that I'm in love, I expect it to be really happy, or at least there won't be half as much anger as there was.","I wanted to be in a punk band before I had even heard any punk music.","I've never considered musical equipment very sacred.","I never listen to 'Nevermind.' I haven't listened to it since we put it out. That says something.","Sometimes I wish I had taken the Bob Dylan route and sang songs where my voice would not go out on me every night, so I could have a career if I wanted.","I own a '66 Jaguar. That's the guitar I polish, and baby - I refuse to let anyone touch it when I jump into the crowd."],"Kurt Eichenwald":["I have no problem with responsible gun owners who own weapons for self-protection, hunting, or just sport. The ones who believe they have a constitutional right to 100-round magazines to fight off I don't know what - a zombie apocalypse? - try to shut down dialogue with threats and other macho posing because of their flawed beliefs.","Plenty of people detested Michael Jackson before his death wiped away the world's collective memory. Timberlake was originally dismissed as just another boy-bander. Legions have joined in a 'Hate Anne Hathaway' movement. Elvis, the Rolling Stones, Kristen Bell, even Mozart had haters.","The doctor gave me several warnings: Never tell anyone unless necessary, because I might be ostracized. Call it 'seizure disorder,' not epilepsy, because fewer people would be frightened. Try to choose a profession as free from stress as possible.","Bitcoins are not a real investment; they are bets inside a casino. If the price goes back up, don't be fooled. In the parlance of popping investment bubbles, it's something called a 'dead-cat bounce.' People who are desperate to keep the game going rush back in, hoping to bring the price back up, but it never lasts.","Basically, whenever someone says they're wrong, conservatives too often fall back on claims that those who disagree with them are biased and thus worthy of being ignored, a convenient position that allows them to avoid debating uncomfortable criticisms.","The myth that people with epilepsy swallow their tongues is very injurious. When I had seizures without my roommates present, I would often wake up with my gums bleeding, my teeth hurting or my jaw aching. Often, well-intentioned people, believing I would choke on my tongue, tried to force open my clenched jaw to put in a hard object.","In the aftermath of the oh-so-predictable crash, the Bitcoin fanatics have begun marshaling out excuse after excuse for why this non-investment investment lost so much of its value so fast. One was that hackers attacked some of the exchanges for Bitcoins and crippled it. Really? A hacker can wreck an entire market?","Too often, it seems, conservatives have scorned experts as incompetent, biased, or otherwise worth ignoring because they came up with answers that didn't fit their politically desired answer. Often, they proclaim experts have a liberal bias. Of course, plenty of Democrats have voted for conservative ideas, but that is beside the point.","Because the Second Amendment is an incomprehensible mess, because too many lobbyists have argued that it is an absolute protection of actions and items never considered at the time of our nation's founding, and because there is a clear state interest in protecting the lives of its citizens, the words must be removed from the Constitution.","When it comes to the teapot tempest that is the Hillary Clinton email imbroglio, the real controversy isn't about politics or regulations. It's about journalism and the weak standards employed to manufacture the scandal du jour.","There were plenty of reasons to suspect Obamacare might have been a colossal failure - although none of them had to do with death panels, huge lines for treatment, a government takeover of health care, etc.","Uninsured people don't just slink off into a corner and die. They seek treatment, but usually when it is an emergency, and this will be the most expensive kind of care available.","When it came to dire warnings about Obamacare, the Republicans were the kings of 'swing and a miss.' People would flee the health care industry to avoid Obamacare? Nope - according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, health care gained about 1 million new jobs in preparation for increased demand.","Obamacare is socialism? Nope - as insurance companies vie to sell new policies, competition within private industry is growing rapidly, with the number of participating insurers growing by 26 percent between 2014 and 2015, and the number of products they offer growing by 66 percent.","To a degree, the West is reaping what it sowed from a major strategic blunder in the aftermath of 9/11 - the entire concept of a war on technique, that is, terrorism. Defining the enemy when fighting a concept was impossible.","A war on Al-Qaeda could have been won with a decisive military strike in Tora Bora during December 2001, but American fighters at Tora Bora were refused requests for more forces when they trapped Al-Qaeda there; the Pentagon was busy husbanding resources for the Iraqi invasion.","Social media is not only the most important tool for inciting terrorists, it can also be an effective weapon against them.","I've often thought that Obama should come out in favor of oxygen, just to see how many right-wingers keel over from holding their breath for too long.","It is the ultimate conceit of conservatives: that more than half of American voters don't make up more than half of our country.","There isn't a lot of honesty when it comes to discussing Obamacare. Too many Republicans lie about the implications of the health-insurance program and dismiss out of hand the reasons a massive overhaul of the long-time system is necessary.","I am an Obamacare agnostic - if it works, as I hope it will for the good of the nation, then it's a great thing. If it doesn't, then that is a disappointing thing, and we need to try something else.","If Republicans truly are dedicated to the sanctity of life, they should be the first ones on the front lines trying to get policies for the uninsured.","People don't have a constitutional right to leave loaded guns lying around. And if they choose to do so - and a kid gets shot and killed because of it - it's not an accident. It's negligent homicide.","All anti-abortion protesters should be presented, on the spot, with an application to sign up as foster parents. They should also be given the names of children in their area in need of adoptive parents. And if they won't sign or volunteer, they should shut up.","Whenever someone says zygotes are babies, I reply: 'Imagine a thousand zygotes in test tubes in one room, and three toddlers in another. A fire breaks out, and you only have time to get to one room. Which would you save from burning - the zygotes or the children?'","When 'Christians' cite the Bible as the basis for secular policies, they must explain why they believe Muslims in the Middle East are evil for doing the same with the Koran.","I've long thought that Marco Rubio would make a strong G.O.P. candidate for president. While he was brought into office by surfing on the Tea Party wave, he has proven himself not to be wedded to the frequent lunacy of those folks.","I think it's wrong for the government to subpoena records from journalists involved in national-security reporting (particularly since I do it myself). I do believe it has a chilling effect on the ability to gather news about potential abuses masked by inappropriate classification.","Assess Bitcoins? All you can do is examine the trading patterns, which do not provide a real analysis of any underlying economic value. The economics of investments are not solely based on supply and demand, and that is all that goes into Bitcoin prices.","The bottom-line message of history is that if you're doubling and tripling your money in record time, you're also more likely to lose it all.","Bitcoins can be traded or used for purchases, but only with those sellers who will accept them. Because it is a system independent of external meddling, there can be no sudden devaluation of Bitcoins through the actions of governments.","If a doctor said you had stomach cancer, would you consult Rush Limbaugh for a second opinion? Of course, that sounds like nonsense, but many Americans have no qualms about listening to political commentators and untrained activists when it comes to even more complex scientific questions.","At any time of day, hundreds of different versions of Facebook are running on the Internet - with a changed color here, a moved button there - and the user response to each variation is measured. And the same is done with advertising.","As late as 2007, Facebook was still trying to figure out what it wanted to be when it grew up. An advertising space seemed to be the obvious answer, but how that would tap into the massive value of the personal data uploaded to the company every day remained a puzzle.","The argument by the anti-gay-marriage crowd is so absurd, so internally contradictory, and so awash in unproven assertions that it is difficult to take it as anything more than a construct cobbled together by people who just don't like those people.","No one - not a conservative or liberal or whatever - can stand back and 'define' what marriage means. Other people's marriages have nothing to do with mine; whether my neighbors are divorced or gay or widowed will not lead me to change anything about how my wife and I deal with each other or how we raise our children.","Plenty of gun opponents have pointed out the obvious: that the Founding Fathers could never have envisioned the kinds of 'arms' that exist today - Washington, Jefferson, and the rest had never even seen a bullet. Musket balls for guns that required constant reloading were the 'arms' of the day.","When the Bill of Rights was written, no one owned a MAG5100, 100-round magazine for an M-16. The concept of a mass slaughter carried out over a matter of minutes was incomprehensible.","By the dawn of the millennium, the hallways at Microsoft were no longer home to barefoot programmers in Hawaiian shirts working through nights and weekends toward a common goal of excellence; instead, life behind the thick corporate walls had become staid and brutish.","Until his dying days, Steve Jobs could not only predict the direction the marketplace would be heading, but help drive it there.","I have always trusted my impulses. I have always believed that once I'm in the circumstances, whatever they may be, I will find the right way.","There have been times that I have found myself in places, and I don't know how I got there, and I don't actually know where I am.","According to the Epilepsy Foundation of America, there are more than two million Americans with epilepsy. Half have what I have, idiopathic epilepsy, meaning there is no known cause for the seizures.","By the time I arrived for my freshman year at Swarthmore College in 1979, I had already had many seizures, although my family, friends and I did not know it."],"Kurt Elling":["I consider myself very fortunate. I have a beautiful wife who supports my work and is raising our daughter when I'm out on the road.","You don't know what bravery is until you overcome fear.","Sometimes people have this notion that improvisation is simply intuitive leaping into the unknown.","That's the thing: There are so many art songs in jazz. It's a much more rich experience for the singer than people think.","It's true that I'm not known as a crooner or balladeer. I'm known for a more crusading or quixotic temperament.","When improvisation is properly applied, it is compositional thinking, sped way up.","Music is a physical expression that has a physical impact upon the listener. Sound travels in waves through the air. This is not abstract. This is scientific fact. And it makes physical contact with the eardrum... and with the heart... and with the rest of the body.","Chicago has a burly, action-oriented but still self-assured and relaxed confidence to its stride. The city has a lot of wide-open space and all the possibilities that suggests. There's a lot of horizontal grandeur here.","In New York, the drummers rush for a reason - because there's so much energy crackling through everything in that city and so many collisions at a highly accelerated rate.","You can start from any source material, and you can approach it with a jazz ear, and then it will become a jazz moment.","I'm a goof, man.","You want to be doing your best work whatever field of the arts you're in because your life's going to be over all too soon, and you have to make the most of it.","Romance is one of the things that most countries share, and I've noticed how different communities have their own ways of singing about love and heartbreak.","I've got more low notes than I had when I started.","I hope that I'm also maturing emotionally as a human being as things go on.","I listened to a lot of King Crimson back in the day.","I haven't been afraid of John Coltrane or Miles Davis or Bill Evans or Wayne Shorter or Herbie Hancock. Why would I be afraid of the Beatles?","I'm a jazz musician, and I really wanted to not miss an opportunity to have the full connection to jazz.","The musicians in Chicago gave me my vocation, but New York calls to a jazz musician, for sure. You want to test your mettle.","Part of my joy as a singer is to give gifts to people, and one way I try to connect to them is to add something in French or German or whatever.","You don't want to make records so you can win a Grammy. You make records because you want to be a musician.","As improvisers, we're acting as composers in front of people.","It must be a hellish thing to know what's possible in music, to be hearing things all the time and not have an appropriate outlet for them.","It's a lovely thing to have people in any circumstance appreciate your work.","Man, I just feel so fortunate to be a jazz musician at all. I have a hard time thinking of it any other way. It's such a fulfilling vocation. I love it.","There's a spiritual complement to any attempt at transposing a commitment to humanity through music or art.","I really thought I was gonna have a straight gig. But these jazz musicians put their arms around me time and again and said, 'Hey, young fella, you're one of us. Come with us.' That's a big deal when you're young and looking for your way in the world.","You work very hard on the lyrics. Getting them to fit the contours of improvised melodies.","We live in a society where it's cool to be criminal.","Out in L.A., things relax even further than they do in Chicago. There's such a looseness to it, and there's a potentially refreshing advantage to that.","We all know that jazz demands a cultivation of the mind.","Of course we all know when music's too much in the head, and we define our greatest players by the way they are able to communicate directly from their emotional selves.","I've tried to learn as much as I can about the great jazz singers to understand what makes them important, vital artists, but there is always something more to learn.","Why limit yourself to one discipline or field of study?","Each of the CDs prior to 'Flirting With Twilight' were more like roller-coaster rides.","My intellect was quickened at divinity school, and my abilities to discern were strengthened, and that's always valuable.","I try to sleep as much as I can. I drink a lot of water. I practice consistently and just try to be ready for the gig.","The singer is always an ambassador of music.","I want to be the jazz singer.","A lot of the commercial world wants to bank in on the cachet that jazz brings.","People want to have access to jazz because it has a vibe that's very strong.","I don't want to take it easy.","You don't just let a guy drop off the earth and not come together with everybody who knew him and loved him and respected him. You try to do it the right way.","If you're going to be transparent, you're going to have to let the music come that wants to come.","I know how hard it's been for me to get my thing out there.","It's easy to get tired of religious fundamentalists. They're such a bore. They have no sense of mystery. It's a drag, man.","A lot of people are put off by the idea of scat singing. Either that or it's something to be made fun of.","I was very lucky that more experienced musicians allowed me to caterwaul until I figured out what it was really about.","My goal is to be really incredible by the time I'm 70.","I think my intention was there, and my love for the music was apparent. And there are very few singers who get up and desire to take the kinds of risks that jazz musicians routinely need to be taking.","I'm one of the culprits who keeps turning stuff around, shaking up original tunes and trying to stand the canon on its ear. But sometimes, you just need to sing the song.","There is an actor's responsibility in presenting the emotional content of the lyrics to an audience. But whether you do that in a straightforward fashion or an ironic fashion or a blase fashion is all about opportunities, and singers are missing opportunities as artists if they don't pay attention to the lyric.","There's a wide spectrum of possibilities in how to deliver a song.","'Man in the Air' was an experience in exercise.","The idea is to be unrestrained by categories.","I travel all the time. And as I go around the world, I try to learn a little something and not just take up all the available air.","There are incredible musicians around the world.","It helps me to learn things in different languages, even if it's just phonetically, and to make myself vulnerable to other audiences by trying to reflect back to them the genius of their own cultures, and to do that, oftentimes, in new jazz settings, new arrangements. It's a way to show respect.","My strength is to communicate with an audience and to know what jazz singing is capable of.","At a certain point, the graduate school thing didn't work out, and that meant I was liberated.","I'm thrilled when I hear the greatest jazz musicians. They continue to search in ways other musicians do not.","If I was going to sell out, I would do it for more than 10,000 records.","You learn as much as you can from the people that you work with. That's why you want to surround yourself with the heaviest people that you can possibly get to.","I had everything to gain by giving it everything I could.","While I revel in the memories of my own Grammy moment, I also know how it feels to walk away empty-handed.","I've worked with a number of big bands, but there's nothing in life like the Basie band.","I've tried to educate myself in the world and what's beautiful and what has meaning and is lasting. Then I just follow my intuition and see how it fits.","I like the power and versatility of a big band and how an orchestra can vary the dynamics from very loud to very quiet, and SNJO covers those bases.","I didn't arrive on the scene until after Jaco Pastorius had passed, but 'Three Views of a Secret' is a long-time favourite of mine.","I try to stick with things that I can sing with honesty.","I think I make most of my decisions pretty organically.","I don't really have a more intellectualized approach. After the fact, I can sure talk about stuff a lot - but when I make decisions, I really just follow what sounds good to me.","I'm lucky that I enjoy touring as much as I do. I'm not going to make a living just making records.","It's pretty rare in jazz to have a full-on steady band.","It's a beautiful thing to have time in the world, as a singer and as a musician, to make friends with people of the musical caliber of a Tommy Smith, an Arturo Sandoval, a Richard Galliano, a Till Broenner.","One doesn't have to scat to be a jazz singer.","I hope to be at the top of my game when I'm 65 or 70. I don't want to reach my peak at 29. Not that I'm holding back anything, but there's a bunch of junk I don't know.","I'm a guy who has more slapstick than Joe Cool moments in his day, so I'm not taking myself so seriously.","People just want to dig; they want to dance. They don't want to work all through the night, and neither do I. I like getting 'out there,' but communication should be occurring on more levels than heavy-laden philosophical.","I'd been studying philosophy at the University of Chicago. I hadn't been doing well, because I was sitting in with jazz musicians at night - it's hard to read Heidegger, but it's especially hard if you're half asleep.","Grammy nominations are certainly pleasant, but you can forget about them and lead a perfectly happy life - provided you have the approval of the musicians you work with.","If you start to dwell on your pain, the amount of pain will increase.","I can't say New York's home, but I've made a lot of friends, and I'm developing a map of what cats are here and where they play, and as a singer, you're always looking for projects that tie things in emotionally and intuitively with your life.","I couldn't do what I do without the encouragement and influence of the musicians I played with in Chicago.","Karl Johnson, my first piano player at Milt Trenier's, he just swung really hard and gave me a sense of really belonging to the jazz scene.","Chicago is my home. And the way Chicago sounds will always be a part of who I am.","The great jazz and jazz-influenced singers carry themselves with a certain panache and a certain elegance and, for lack of a better word, self-confidence.","Every record is a gate of a certain kind for me.","I spend upwards of 200 nights a year on the road.","Audiences have taught me how to sing better and entertain better.","With a smaller setting, you have a lot more freedom and flexibility within a given moment, but not necessarily the velocity you have with a big band.","Listening to something without being present is different from being there in the flesh.","You can never predict what the specific shape of your life is going to be, and you won't really know its general shape until, God willing, you're advanced in years and you have the time and opportunity to look back in a coherent way and see what your life was about.","Salacious? I suppose every once in a while the salacious thing is not a bad thing. It's kind of monochromatic if that's all you do.","I've got enough miles under my belt to know that whatever you envision in your mind, even if it comes true, will only keep a shape in the most general way.","I think of jazz as being homage through innovation. Don't quote that as a definition, but it comes pretty close.","You don't show respect to Frank Sinatra and his great example by trying to sound exactly like him. You show it by sounding exactly like you, and that's the way jazz has always progressed as an art form.","I remember seeing Tony Bennett on television. He was the only guy in the orchestra who was wearing a white tux, and I thought, 'That would be good. To be the only man on stage in a white jacket.'","Sometimes, with vocalese, I'm dealing with something, a great solo from the past, which is so iconic I can't presume to change it or mess with it."],"Kurt Fuller":["I grew up as a very sarcastic person. I was always the class clown, and to date girls, I had to be really funny. I was really skinny growing up. I was so thin, I had to run around in the shower to get wet. That kind of thin. So I always had to rely on humor and sarcasm.","I went to UC Berkeley. I graduated in 1976, immediately moved to L.A. with a degree in English - which did no more for you then than it does for you now - then sold real estate and did theater for nine years.","I can overact in two seconds.","You don't go to Berkeley to become an actor. In fact, I don't think you go to any school to become an actor. You've just sort of got to go out there and act.","Jensen Ackles has everything I want. He's in great shape. He's got a full head of hair. He's got a square jawline. He's a big star!","The Tracy Morgan you see is the Tracy Morgan in real life. He's a great guy but... man, is he a nut.","The Will Smith that you see in movies is exactly the same as Will Smith in real life. Except for when he plays a superhero, because the real Will Smith can't fly. He can only hover.","Acting is one of those things that anybody can do because no one can learn it, but only a few people can really do because it's nothing you can learn.","I'm not curing cancer. I'm not saving lives. It's my job. I'm an actor. It's a good, fun job. People enjoy it, but there are many other people who are doing so many things that are more worthwhile. I just don't see anything that special about it. I see it as entertaining.","I didn't get married until I was forty because I wanted to be stable when I got married. I think I just avoided my first marriage and went right to the second. It's sort of how I see it. When you're young, just trying to make it, and trying to find your way in the world, and figure things out... being married is not easy.","It's a strange thing to have a successful television show because if it's too interesting... people don't really pay attention when they watch TV. It has to be good, but not so interesting that you really have to pay attention because people multitask. So, if a show demands your entire attention, it has a tough time making it."],"Kurt Huber":["There is a point at which the law becomes immoral and unethical. That point is reached when it becomes a cloak for the cowardice that dares not stand up against blatant violations of justice.","A state that suppresses all freedom of speech, and which by imposing the most terrible punishments, treats each and every attempt at criticism, however morally justified, and every suggestion for improvement as plotting to high treason, is a state that breaks an unwritten law.","In spite of everything, I still believe that people are truly good at heart.","I hope to God that the inner strength that will vindicate my deeds will in good time spring forth from my own people. I have done as I had to on the prompting of my inner voice.","You have stripped from me the rank and privileges of the professorship and the doctoral degree which I earned, and you have set me at the level of the lowest criminal.","What I intended to accomplish was to rouse the student body, not by means of an organization, but solely by my simple words; to urge them, not to violence, but to moral insight into the existing serious deficiencies of our political system.","As a German citizen, as a German professor, and as a political person, I hold it to be not only my right but also my moral duty to take part in the shaping of our German destiny, to expose and oppose obvious wrongs."],"Kurt Johnstad":["It's how I've lived my life. You show up, work hard, and be humble.","Save for a few people in my life, every close male relationship that I have, they're all warriors, whether they're SEALs, competitive martial artists, or professional mountain climbers. They have a certain code."],"Kurt Lewin":["If you want to truly understand something, try to change it.","A successful individual typically sets his next goal somewhat but not too much above his last achievement. In this way he steadily raises his level of aspiration."],"Kurt Loder":["If you ask questions that interest you, you'll get answers that interest your audience.","You find the most important thing that really grabs you, and put it right up top. Don't bury the lead. Put it at the top. Best thing to do. Never go wrong that way. It's an immutable law of journalism. It just always works.","Whomever you're going to interview, you have to be interested in what it is you want to know from them. You have to be interested in the subject.","Well, news is anything that's interesting, that relates to what's happening in the world, what's happening in areas of the culture that would be of interest to your audience.","Well, in features, and in writing especially, it's often the style of the writer comes in.","Well, a lead is the most important thing about the story.","Unless you're doing a feature piece, which is going to be longer, and you have more time to get into stuff.","Television's very dependent on images. That's not what news is.","Television's not going read stories to you.","Some of the most important stories don't lend themselves to television treatment.","So, yeah, I think it had a major effect. I think in franchising younger people, it was just an idea that's never been trotted out before, but it makes perfectly good sense.","So you shouldn't really flatter yourself that they want to be your buddy. They don't. Generally. They want you for some reason or other, and you just have to fend that off all the time.","So no one should rely on television either for their knowledge of music or for news. There's just more going on. It's an adjunct to the written word, which I think is still the most important thing.","Rewriting is a large part of the whole job. And get rid of stuff that's not working. Just pare it down until it's a beautiful thing you can hand in, probably late, to your editor.","It's not a good thing to be friends with people you're covering. There's just no point in doing it. It's tempting, but they're not going to consider you their friend anyway. They just know that you're somebody that can do something for them.","It's gonna be short if it's news; put it at the top. Style's not an issue, just make it news.","If your audience is young, it'd be youth culture, if your audience is older, it'd be older people, if it were senior citizens, it'd be senior citizen issues. So you try and hit the target audience.","I worked for a newspaper in Europe for, I lived in Europe for about seven years, so I worked in this sort of a yellow journalism kind of a thing, it was like a scandal sheet.","I was in college for two years, and just hated it in the '60s.","I think television often has dismissed younger people. They figure, well, they're not really watching news, that's not our audience.","I spent time in, like, criminal courts, and covering murder trials for papers.","I know what the structure of the language is.","I don't find music being less important than, like, politics.","I came over here and worked for rock magazines, and I worked for Rolling Stone, which has a very high standard of journalism, a very good research department.","But music raises a lot of issues. Music is something that matters to people a lot, and they put a lot of passion into it. And I think when you have an area like that, you're gonna find a lot of issues coming up.","And you can't really cover people critically that you're friends with.","And the most important thing you can do is learn to edit yourself. And then go back and rewrite.","And that's very important, too, 'cause a lot of people just assume everyone's a Democrat, or everyone's a Republican or whatever, and they're not. And that's a really important thing to adhere to.","And so popular culture raises issues that are very important, actually, in the country I think. You get issues of the First Amendment rights and issues of drug use, issues of AIDS, and things like that all arise naturally out of pop culture.","And I think a good writer's gonna make it interesting. From the first paragraph it will all be interesting. Just work at it and work at it and work at it."],"Kurt Masur":["What I never overcame is a kind of shyness.","In South America, I heard the 8th Symphony of Beethoven. And the young conductor thought, Beethoven must be heroic. But this is piece which shouldn't be heroic. And this was such a misunderstanding, such a deep misunderstanding.","As I came to New York, it was for me a new beginning. To discover what people are living here. What do they need, what do they expect, what would they like to be the image and the performance of the New York Philharmonic?","You have to change your mind with every orchestra because every orchestra has a different character.","An orchestra full of stars can be a disaster.","Young conductors who are confident enough, they very often have success.","You know as I started as a shy young conductor, I always wanted to cooperate. To build up the musicians. To help them to be better than without a conductor. And sometimes young talented musicians have to be encouraged.","Very often, if I know the orchestra doesn't know a piece or it's a new piece, I have main ideas about it. But then we start to play and I never talk about places where they played so beautiful and so clear in the beginning that there is nothing to say.","The message of music was also the first thing what I learned from my first teacher. She was an organist too and she was very devoted to what she played, so she had a respect for every piece and she felt that she is not allowed to add something of her own.","Sometimes if you have very confident people, you have to tell them please, be polite, there are other players are good enough as you and you should never speak out of an orchestra.","Since the composer has said everything, if you discover everything, it will be enough and you will be a happy man. Don't try to say it's your taste, and because of that you are changing this or that. And I must say this respect is still there.","If you go to Japan for instance, you should know that they have a different way of playing Beethoven or Brahms. But if you play with them Mozart, Debussy, Mendelssohn, they have a wonderful light feeling for that.","I wouldn't say I've changed my mind. I changed some of my natural habits, some of my natural character.","I worked on scores. I went to the musical library in Berlin which is very famous. I discovered that we had scores of Beethoven, printed scores of Beethoven, that are full of mistakes. Not the wrong or false notes, but the wrong dynamic, understandable things.","I was different from most young conductors today.","I can go in front of an orchestra. I can go in front of an audience. But if you see me walking through an audience in the reception or through a lot of people, I'm still shy.","I believe so, but at first he must know. He must know in which spirit Beethoven has composed this piece. He must try to study that. And he must find out in which station of life of Beethoven he did.","I always imagined that to bring an orchestra to play together is not enough for a conductor.","Even my family laughed at me because they thought this young guy who's always stuttering in front of other people should be in front of 100 musicians and talk to them and leading them.","Even I had no opportunity to conduct very many concerts after World War II.","At the age of 16, something happened with my finger and the doctor told me, you never can be a organist or pianist, so think about what you do with music.","And to understand this, I think this is a most important point where I would like always to be understood what we do with the New York Philharmonic. That the meaning of the music is number one.","And if you are strong enough, then you can grow as a conductor more and more.","And I always tried to be not a star. To be someone who people like to talk to.","And at the same time, I had my very first concert at the age of 16. I hadn't heard a symphony orchestra before, and I was so deeply impressed I said I have to be a conductor."],"Kurt Russell":["I do get cynical, but what can you do? It doesn't make any difference.","I always look forward to working with Goldie because she's a great person to work with.","When I was working on my career, I was very aware of what I had done, what I wanted to do next. I'm having a good time just reading things that might be interesting to do.","I no longer look at my life and times in the motion picture industry as my career. I just look at it now as something I like and want to do.","I don't really look for specific types of projects any more. I'm not taking care of a career anymore. I'm just having fun acting.","My first year of pro ball I played in the Northwest league and made the all-star team, and the next year I played I led the team in hitting and was third or fifth in the league.","Human beings, from their own point of view, are very different than what people see.","We are in a democratic society. It's our job to question.","I was brought up by two people who just said, Whatever it is you're interested in, go do it. There is no winning or losing. You find out when you do it what the experience is.","If it hadn't been for the videocassette, I may not have had a career at all.","I seem to have a knack for picking movies that go on to be cult favorites.","Society questions the police and their methods, and the police say, Do you want the criminals off the street or not?","I usually hang out on the set. I get to know everybody. I have a nice time with the other actors.","I started playing ball when I was a kid. My dad was a pro ball player and he passed on his knowledge to me.","I played professional level sports. When you're playing for money, it's a whole other level.","I've never looked at my career in terms of, What haven't I done that I want to do? I just generally find a story that I think is a good one and go to work.","If they're willing to pay you what you think you're worth for it, that's why an actor goes to work. A lot of times they want to pay you a lot for a picture you don't want to do.","If I see one side of somebody, I want to see the other side.","I wasn't really serious about acting - I was serious about baseball.","Acting was something that just came along. But I made good money, so it wasn't something I was just going to put aside and pretend it didn't exist.","I got a kick out of the stands when they would heckle me. I would take the energy from that.","For guys playing sports at a high level, for money, I can't put my finger on it, but in a man's world of sport, there is something visceral to beating another man.","We all do that thing which is the best in movies - we relate.","I know I come off differently than I think of myself. I'm always surprised by what people say about me.","I can evaluate a player in a very short period of time because I'm very close to that game, very educated in that game and played the game for a long, long time. I wasn't just a guy with talent. I learned a lot about the game.","When you think you're good, you will play at that level. If you doubt yourself, you will play like crap.","When you first are in front of the camera as a young person, you'd be surprised at all the insecurities you can get."],"Kurt Schrader":["I am open and willing to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle on a variety of appropriate measures we can take to prevent firearms from getting into the wrong hands and mitigate future tragedies.","I firmly believe that if members of Congress fail to perform their most basic duty in passing a budget, then they do not deserve to be paid.","I'm big on this 'no budget, no pay.' I think that's important. Let's get right at the heart of the issue. Even when I was in the state legislature, the most important function we had was to pass the bloody budget.","At the end of the day, if it looks like you're not going to get paid, you might be willing to compromise to make sure that budget actually comes out. It's not all about your extreme point of view.","I'm for fighting a war on terrorism, not a war in Southwest Asia that Alexander the Great couldn't win, the British Empire couldn't win, the Soviet Union couldn't win. That's stupid. It's a waste of resources; a waste of America's best and brightest.","In the ever-evolving society we live in, it is the responsibility of all of us, as individuals and as Americans, to rid ourselves of this culture of violence."],"Kurt Schwitters":["The picture is a self-sufficient work of art. It is not connected to anything outside.","My name is Kurt Schwitters... I am an artist and I nail my pictures together."],"Kurt Student":["The secondary attack was made against The Hague. Its aim was to get a hold upon the Dutch capital, and in particular to capture the Government offices and the Service headquarters.","For fear of dropping the troops in the sea, the pilots tended to drop them too far inland - some of them actually in the British lines. The weapon containers often fell wide of the troops, which was another handicap that contributed to our excessive casualties.","After that he turned to the question of invading England. Hitler said that during the previous year he could not afford to risk a possible failure; apart from that, he had not wished to provoke the British, as he hoped to arrange peace talks.","In this respect I expressed my doubts about using the Corps directly on the South coast, to form a bridgehead for the Army - as the area immediately behind the coast was now covered with obstacles. These doubts were accepted by Hitler."],"Kurt Sutter":["I'm a guy who has problems with moderation. All or nothing. Binge and purge. Kill or be killed. Gray is not a color I wear well. I should be dead. I know that. I should not be successful. I know that too. My daily existence is a toss of the coin - one side, fear, the other side, gratitude.","I navigate through the world with the excitement and determination of a child. That's why I'm an artist. I'd die without an outlet for expression. Unfortunately, more often than not, that childlike energy is the maturity level I bring to many circumstances.","Man's inhumanity to man is as old as humanity itself. Some people just do evil things. Most do not. A billion people have seen 'Batman' movies over the past 20 years, and they have been entertained and inspired. One man saw it as a sick entry point for mass murder. The one is tragic. The billion are not. I choose to write for the billion.","I'm a guy desperately in need of buffers. I have big feelings, big reactions, big emotions. All the things that serve me as an artist, but challenge me as a socially-responsible human being.","I've learned in most areas of my life, to bounce heated choices off other people. Co-workers, my agent, my wife, a sponsor, etc. A majority of the time, that keeps me on the right side of things.","The lazy blogosphere has given up on journalism and now trolls Twitter for their on-the-record in-depth articles.","The whole Twitter phenomenon is really indicative of what's happening in this country. And I say this in condemnation of myself as much as anyone else - we are growing into a nation that has no time, desire or capacity for truth. All we can handle is 140 characters of knowledge.","I've made a career writing about fictitious anti-heroes. To create these worlds, I've spent a lot of time with active members on both sides of the law. And if I had to pick the most interesting of the two, the choice is obvious - we all love the guys in black.","What happens on 'Mad Men' in terms of the acting and the writing and the directing, it's superior. And yes, it has tremendous cache and buzz because it's become iconic, but it also deserves all the kudos and the awards as well, because it's a beautiful show to look at.","My wife, Katey Sagal, has transformed herself from a sitcom cartoon to a dramatic powerhouse.","All the people who follow me on Twitter know my sense of humor. I sometimes forget the blogosphere will give it more weight than I intended.","Unlike fiction, which you create before you go into production, with reality you kind of create it after everything is produced. The drama and the storytelling is really done in post.","Never in the history of 'The Shield' was the word 'LAPD' ever mentioned. We would mention districts, like Wilshire and Hollenbeck and Marina, but Farmington was a fictitious district, and we never actually uttered the word 'LAPD.' So that was sort of the deal we made with them.","I can be arrogant, I can be insufferable.","I joke that I learned the essentials of storytelling from Hanna-Barbera, but I pretty much did. That kind of television is what enamored me as a kid, and that's what really got me hooked. You could say that's where it all began.","I was really exposed to great old-time literature - the classics, the poetic realists like Strindberg and Ibsen and all those guys. I was really inspired by all those guys. That's when writing became a primary focus.","I'm drawn to the classic antihero, the guy who's probably made a bunch of mistakes and really has the capacity to go either way. That's the most interesting type of character for me to watch, to see what decisions they'll make. There's a lot of gray area there for a writer to explore.","Me personally, I'm a guy who it took a long time to figure out what I'm supposed to be doing. I relate to a lot of that finding oneself a little later in the game, or being thrown a curve later in the game.","The trap in Hamlet is he's the most passive of Shakespeare's characters. He's not a Richard III, not out there taking a lot of action. It's a lot of asides and soliloquies where he's wrapped in angst, and that's not a very interesting character.","I'm a storyteller... I haves a God-given gift that I can share with you and perhaps entertain you and bring you along for the ride... So when anybody tries to take that away from me, or impede that, I get defensive."],"Kurt Vonnegut":["I want to stand as close to the edge as I can without going over. Out on the edge you see all the kinds of things you can't see from the center.","True terror is to wake up one morning and discover that your high school class is running the country.","Laughter and tears are both responses to frustration and exhaustion. I myself prefer to laugh, since there is less cleaning up to do afterward.","This is Sunday, and the question arises, what'll I start tomorrow?","New knowledge is the most valuable commodity on earth. The more truth we have to work with, the richer we become.","The arts are not a way to make a living. They are a very human way of making life more bearable. Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow, for heaven's sake.","We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful what we pretend to be.","I tell you, we are here on Earth to fart around, and don't let anybody tell you different.","We could have saved the Earth but we were too damned cheap.","Science sent the Hubble telescope out into space, so it could capture light and the absence thereof, from the very beginning of time. And the telescope really did that. So now we know that there was once absolutely nothing, such a perfect nothing that there wasn't even nothing or once.","I'm convinced that no one can amount to a damn in the arts if he becomes sweetly reasonable, seeing all sides of a picture, forgiving all sins.","Maturity is a bitter disappointment for which no remedy exists, unless laughter could be said to remedy anything.","I think a lot of people, including me, clammed up when a civilian asked about battle, about war. It was fashionable. One of the most impressive ways to tell your war story is to refuse to tell it, you know. Civilians would then have to imagine all kinds of deeds of derring-do.","Still and all, why bother? Here's my answer. Many people need desperately to receive this message: I feel and think much as you do, care about many of the things you care about, although most people do not care about them. You are not alone.","There is no reason why good cannot triumph as often as evil. The triumph of anything is a matter of organization. If there are such things as angels, I hope that they are organized along the lines of the Mafia.","I let the dog out, or I let him in, and we talk some. I let him know I like him, and he lets me know he likes me.","About astrology and palmistry: they are good because they make people vivid and full of possibilities. They are communism at its best. Everybody has a birthday and almost everybody has a palm.","Everyone now knows how to find the meaning of life within himself. But mankind wasn't always so lucky. Less than a century ago, men and women did not have easy access to the puzzle boxes within them.","When a man becomes a writer, I think he takes on a sacred obligation to produce beauty and enlightenment and comfort at top speed.","If you appear in the 'Atlantic' or 'Harper's' or the 'New Yorker,' by God, you must be a writer, because everybody says so.","Here we are, trapped in the amber of the moment. There is no why.","There is love enough in this world for everybody, if people will just look.","Human beings will be happier - not when they cure cancer or get to Mars or eliminate racial prejudice or flush Lake Erie but when they find ways to inhabit primitive communities again. That's my utopia.","Anything can make me stop and look and wonder, and sometimes learn.","To whom it may concern: It is springtime. It is late afternoon.","I asked myself about the present: how wide it was, how deep it was, how much was mine to keep.","That is how you get to be a writer, incidentally: you feel somehow marginal, somehow slightly off-balance all the time.","Evolution can go to hell as far as I am concerned. What a mistake we are. We have mortally wounded this sweet life-supporting planet - the only one in the whole Milky Way - with a century of transportation whoopee.","People aren't supposed to look back. I'm certainly not going to do it anymore.","If you are an American, you must allow all ideas to circulate freely in your community, not merely your own.","I was not an anthropology student prior to the war. I took it up as part of a personal readjustment following some bewildering experiences as an infantryman and later as a prisoner of war in Dresden, Germany. The science of the Study of Man has been extremely satisfactory from that personal standpoint.","If you can do a half-assed job of anything, you're a one-eyed man in a kingdom of the blind.","It is a very mixed blessing to be brought back from the dead.","I consider anybody a twerp who hasn't read 'Democracy in America' by Alexis de Tocqueville. There can never be a better book than that one on the strengths and vulnerabilities inherent in our form of government.","It may be that the most striking thing about members of my literary generation in retrospect will be that we were allowed to say absolutely anything without fear of punishment.","Any reviewer who expresses rage and loathing for a novel is preposterous. He or she is like a person who has put on full armor and attacked a hot fudge sundae.","The year was 2081, and everyone was finally equal.","Science is magic that works.","I get up at 7:30 and work four hours a day. Nine to twelve in the morning, five to six in the evening. Businessmen would achieve better results if they studied human metabolism. No one works well eight hours a day. No one ought to work more than four hours.","Beware of the man who works hard to learn something, learns it, and finds himself no wiser than before.","One of the things that I tell beginning writers is this: If you describe a landscape, or a cityscape, or a seascape, always be sure to put a human figure somewhere in the scene. Why? Because readers are human beings, mostly interested in human beings. People are humanists. Most of them are humanists, that is.","What should young people do with their lives today? Many things, obviously. But the most daring thing is to create stable communities in which the terrible disease of loneliness can be cured.","I really wonder what gives us the right to wreck this poor planet of ours.","People have to talk about something just to keep their voice boxes in working order so they'll have good voice boxes in case there's ever anything really meaningful to say.","All time is all time. It does not change. It does not lend itself to warnings or explanations. It simply is.","Lot's wife, of course, was told not to look back where all those people and their homes had been. But she did look back, and I love her for that, because it was so human.","What troubles me most about my lovely country is that its children are seldom taught that American freedom will vanish, if, when they grow up, and in the exercise of their duties as citizens, they insist that our courts and policemen and prisons be guided by divine or natural law.","The universe is a big place, perhaps the biggest.","I am honorary President of the American Humanist Society, having succeeded the late, great science fiction writer Isaac Asimov in that utterly functionless capacity. We Humanists behave as well as we can, without any rewards or punishments in an Afterlife.","As a Humanist, I love science. I hate superstition, which could never have given us A-bombs.","People don't come to church for preachments, of course, but to daydream about God.","One might be led to suspect that there were all sorts of things going on in the universe which he or she did not thoroughly understand.","Actually, to be an effective person politically in this country, I think you have to be thirty or over, and also you have to be rich, well-placed, you have to be close to power. And I don't think that young people, because they look young, can do much, as I think they are counterproductive.","This country is being managed to death, being public related to death.","I don't plot my books rigidly, follow a preconceived structure. A novel mustn't be a closed system - it's a quest.","Who is more to be pitied, a writer bound and gagged by policemen or one living in perfect freedom who has nothing more to say?","I was a chemistry major, but I'm always winding up as a teacher in English departments, so I've brought scientific thinking to literature. There's been very little gratitude for this.","There is never a shortage anywhere of lawyers eager to attack the First Amendment, as though it were nothing more than a clause in a lease from a crooked slumlord.","I now make my living by being impolite. I am clumsy at it.","If people think nature is their friend, then they sure don't need an enemy.","When I'm being funny, I try not to offend. I don't think much of what I've done has been in really ghastly taste. I don't think I have embarrassed many people or distressed them.","I left the Middle West for Schenectady because the General Electric Company offered me a more congenial, better paying job than did anyone else.","People need good lies. There are too many bad ones.","I was taught that the human brain was the crowning glory of evolution so far, but I think it's a very poor scheme for survival.","All writers are going to have to learn more about science, because it's such an interesting part of their environment.","Never index your own book.","I think I belong to America's last generation of novelists. Novelists will come one by one from now on, not in seeming families, and will perhaps write only one or two novels, and let it go at that.","Oh, sure, we have another world war coming, and another great depression, but where are the leaders this time?","I think big business is a terrible thing for the spirit of the country, as our spirit is the best thing about us.","I am from a family of artists. Here I am, making a living in the arts. It has not been a rebellion. It's as though I had taken over the family Esso station.","A chaplain's assistant is customarily a figure of fun in the American Army.","I have no degree in biochemistry, neither do I have one in mechanical engineering, as the Army saw fit to terminate both courses before they were finished.","Back in my days as a chemistry student, I used to be quite a technocrat. I was firmly convinced that scientists would have cornered God and photographed Him in color by 1951.","Over the years, people I've met have often asked me what I'm working on, and I've usually replied that the main thing was a book about Dresden.","Call me Jonah. My parents did, or nearly did. They called me John.","The feeling about a soldier is, when all is said and done, he wasn't really going to do very much with his life anyway. The example usually is: he wasn't going to compose Beethoven's Fifth.","It was very lucky for me as a writer that I studied the physical sciences rather than English. I wrote for my own amusement. There was no kindly English professor to tell me for my own good how awful my writing really was. And there was no professor with the power to order me what to read, either.","Younger scientists are extremely sensitive to the moral implications of all they do.","During most of my freelancing, I made what I would have made in charge of the cafeteria at a pretty good junior-high school.","I'm screamingly funny, you know, I really am in the books. And that helps because I'm funnier than a lot of people, I think, and that's appreciated by young people.","Puny man can do nothing at all to help or please God Almighty, and Luck is not the hand of God.","Any man can call time out, but no man can say how long the time out will be.","My cash cows, the slick magazines, were put out of business by TV.","I hope to build a reputation as a science-fiction writer. That's the pitch. We'll see.","It is a big temptation to me, when I create a character for a novel, to say that he is what he is because of faulty wiring, or because of microscopic amounts of chemicals which he ate or failed to eat on that particular day.","I had no talent for science. What was infinitely worse: all my fraternity brothers were engineers."],"Kurtis Blow":["I was signed when I was 19 years old, in 1980. I went to Germany and France. Seeing the world at that time was just an awesome experience for a teenager.","Hip Hop is thee dominant youth culture in the world right now.","I used to date Latoya for awhile, I was a close freind of the family.","I was called Kool Dj Kurt Walker... but they wanted tocall me Kurtis Blow.","My first jam was at Hotel Diplomat opening for Hollywood.","Pete Dj Jones was the first person that I saw with 2 turntables. This was 1972.","When I was 13 I had a fake Id that said that I was 19. I was getting in all the clubs.","Yeah when I was 7 or 8 my moms would have little parties, and I would play the music.","The Bronx is famous for two things. Hip-hop, and 26 world championships.","The music business is really a spiritual business whether we know it or not.","That's the job of the entertainer, to entertain, not to motivate or inspire people to get violent!","I started DJing, breakdancing and MCing in the '70s and I got my record deal in 1979 with 'Christmas Rap.'"],"Kurtwood Smith":["I really miss the rehearsal process of theater.","If I had not gotten along so well with some of the people on the show, it would have been a different story. But in this case, it was great. But sure, it will be fun to look around.","We did this film in 13 days, mind you. And 13 days is not very long for a feature film. Nobody in their right mind would argue that. Nobody in their right mind would do that.","Peter Boyle on Everybody Loves Raymond is more of an insane Dad.","I don't mind the audience identifying me with Red.","We have a great time on that show, and we enjoy one another's company on stage and off. And sitcoms don't have bad schedules. We started out working five days a week, but now we're down to three.","More of him came from my step-dad, who is now passed away. The initial creators of the show kind of based the character on their dads and then I added my dad."],"Kushal Pal Singh":["Land is an emotional subject with a farmer in India because it is his only means of income.","Urban development in India... will be the biggest sunrise industry that any country has seen in any part of the world.","I am a little extrovert.","In urbanization, you think big because you are thinking decades ahead.","If it was not for Rajiv Gandhi, urbanization in India would have been history.","When a person is dispossessed of his land, there is a reaction and you have to deal with the reaction properly. You just can't deal with the reaction by giving him money.","Real estate is one sector that India is not very proud of.","Without land, how can you have development of roads, highways, townships, etc?","I learned a lot from Jack Welch about how to run a business.","As reforms have come into India, as India has started opening up, prosperity is increasing, as is demand for urban housing."],"Kwame Nkrumah":["We prefer self-government with danger to servitude in tranquility.","We face neither East nor West: we face forward.","Freedom is not something that one people can bestow on another as a gift. Thy claim it as their own and none can keep it from them.","Revolutions are brought about by men, by men who think as men of action and act as men of thought.","The best way of learning to be an independent sovereign state is to be an independent sovereign state.","A State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny. It is this factor which makes neo-colonialism such a serious threat to world peace."],"Kyan Douglas":["We all have our paths in life we are supposed to follow to find who we are supposed to be, but it's not always a straight path. There is something inside of us that guides us, and if you are quiet and listen to it, you'll be all right.","Queer Eye is a makeover show, meant to help our straight brethren.","Our Quakers love us. we're big with the Quakers. It's all about cleanliness.","You know what I like about disposable razors? They're disposable.","We shouldn't any of us be afraid of teaching protective measures to save lives.","There really is something raw about sexuality that's real and good and we must continue to learn to not be ashamed of it. But - we have to honor the reality of practicing safer sex.","The externals are important but I'm not interested in superficiality.","That said, we don't approach these improvements as only a surface aesthetic. The producers and we think that these men are helped with their inner needs when they pay attention to their externals.","Our sexual lives are maintained by the shadow side and the light side, so the more we can understand and embrace enlightenment, the less need there is for chemical enhancement.","No nose hair. Ever. You'd be surprised at all the little twigs sticking out. I just can't get it. How can you see that and not just want to hack it off?","It's not being marketed as a gay show by a gay person. It's just Ellen DeGeneres.","I'm no interior decorator, but just I have a feeling that plastic plants in the bathroom... probably not a good idea.","I'm all for guys being butch and guys being men. I identify with that and appreciate that. But if I'm going to stab my gay brother in the back who isn't butch and who maybe acts a little bit more effeminate, what good is that?","I like a woman with priorities.","I just don't know that shame and fear need to be our teachers; rather, compassion, understanding, and love should be our guides.","I enjoy my relationship with straight men. It's very nurturing. It's very validating to hang out with straight guys and be accepted. So many of us, we were not accepted when we were younger by straight persons in high school.","For the first time in my life, I want the right to get married. I've met somebody who meets the criteria of what I've always imagined in and wanted from a partner - someone to marry and to bring children into the world with.","For myself, Queer Eye feeds more to my heart and my soul than as a platform for a career.","Everyone's hip to the fact that we all do things to accentuate our looks - and it's much more accepted.","Drugs and alcohol can be so destructive.","Call me old-fashioned, but I like my conditioners to be conditioners and my shampoos to be shampoos.","I don't ever apologize for who I am because then I let someone else decide who I am.","Ever since I was young, I was always interested in exploring spirituality. I know that there are many paths to God, there is not just one path.","I've tried to take the opportunity to be as positive a person as I can be, as positive role model as I can be."],"Kygo":["I just like playing songs with happy vibes and good feelings.","I feel like music can affect you in so many ways. When you hear a song with a happy melody, it can change your mood; it can change your day.","I consider myself more of a producer and a musician than a DJ.","Making music all the time was my dream.","Edinburgh has a similar climate to Bergen - it's very rainy and grey. There were a lot of days I'd sit inside in front of the computer, make music, and dream about summer - instead of the rainy reality outside.","I am proud to perform at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert.","I just want to keep challenging myself and keep, like, trying new things.","I've been a sports fan forever.","When I look for people to work with, I'm just looking for talented people.","When I make a song, I'm really happy. It's an indescribable feeling.","When I am back home, I have an upright piano and I play constantly.","Edinburgh is where I started. A lot of the remixes I made were done in my room there, and it was a good place for me to make music.","The difference between doing a remix and an original track is that when you do a remix, you obviously already have the original track as a starting point. But with the originals you start from scratch.","I don't really know too many designers. I like a lot of what Kanye West has done with Yeezy, but I think it's a bit too, how you say, elevated; it's a little bit too special. Like he's trying to make something that's kind of a little bit too cool sometimes.","I'm always looking to develop my sound and I'm in the studio whenever I have the time to do this. Always looking ahead!","People don't really listen to albums anymore. They just find good songs.","I really do try and play as many festivals as possible.","I've got a great team around me with my family, manager and label, and we've all worked hard together to make things happen.","There's just a completely different vibe at festivals. Everyone gets to hang out and enjoy their favorite music all day. I really do try and play as many festivals as possible!","I started studying business and finance in Edinburgh as a backup plan. I was still making music many hours a day, and when I was at university, the electronic music boom started really taking off globally.","I get better and better every day, but there is still a lot to learn.","I just wanted to make melodies. I started trying to do my own thing and let the melodies make the genre themselves.","'Coming Over' was probably the fastest collaboration I've ever done.","I don't like to classify my own tracks as a genre.","I'm just trying to experiment with a lot of different stuff and see what comes out of it.","I get into a zone where I'm really in my own world when I make music.","Avicii's melodies were so simple and cool, and they were actually similar to the melodies I played on piano. I thought if I could teach myself how to produce and get those melodies out of my head and into the computer, maybe I could make some cool music, too.","I'm so happy people have enjoyed listening to my tracks.","If I never showed my face, it would kind of be easier.","I do have in the back of my head that you never know how long it lasts.","It's kind of hard when you're on the road all the time, from one show to the next, from one hotel room to the next hotel room, it's kind of hard to think about everything.","It's kind of crazy to see how many people actually listen to my music.","I guess the biggest thing I had to get used to was people staring. At first it was like, 'Am I wearing something odd? Is there something on my face?' It was kind of weird because when I go to the grocery store, people, they're not necessarily coming up to me asking for a photo, they just... look at me.","I get inspired by a lot of different stuff. My father is a huge music fan.","It was the fans sharing my music around that started it all for me.","I started taking piano lessons from the age of six years old. It's such an essential part of what I do in the production process. I wouldn't be Kygo today without those piano lessons.","I think my music covers a broader sound than just 'Tropical House'... My goal is to simply be a great producer in my own right without being pigeonholed.","I really enjoy doing remixes, but I don't want to be known as just a 'remix artist' for the rest of my career.","I've been so fortunate to have the opportunity to work with some incredibly talented vocalists, guitarists and producers, and I can't wait to share more originals in the future.","I get a lot of demos sent my way, and I listen to them, and sometimes they just have something very special.","Lemaitre has been one of my inspirations ever since I started making music.","While I was born in Singapore, I didn't actually grow up here. So I don't remember all that much.","I always knew I wanted to create original material, and after having meetings with all sorts of record labels, I decided that Sony was the right place to do it. They knew what I wanted to make and gave me the freedom to express myself.","I didn't think it was cool for me to walk around with a huge Kygo logo on myself.","I find inspiration in what artists and regular people on the street wear, but I'm also very influenced by what I like to wear since I style myself.","When I go into a store and find a T-shirt that's well-designed with a great fabric but the fit is all wrong, the T-shirt is ruined for me.","My biggest influence growing up was Avicii, who put me onto creating the sorts of melodies that feature throughout my songs today.","I wouldn't be where I am without my fans, and I am very thankful for them.","Sometimes I can sit at my computer and find a cool sound, or a new synth patch, and get super-inspired by that and make a track based on that sound. But the piano is where I find the inspiration and come up with the melody.","Elton John and Billy Joel, I find them both to be huge inspirations, those guys are so talented.","I want to be known simply as a producer who makes music.","I hate being put in a box labelled 'tropical house.'","Compared to EDM, I feel like there are a lot of girls at my shows.","If you do the same thing all the time, it's not very challenging.","A lot of producers don't have any musical education. I couldn't make the music I make without playing the piano.","I called it 'Cloud 9' because that's the place I want to take people when they are listening to my music. It's also where I am when I make music.","When I travel too much, it affects the music, and that is the most important thing. As long as I make good music, I can play shows, but if the music starts getting bad, the show offers won't come.","There's nothing like playing at home.","Coldplay doesn't have to stay within a certain genre; they just go where they go.","SiriusXM has had my back ever since day one when I was making remixes in my dorm room at university, and it means a lot that they're supporting my music as I prepare to release my debut album, 'Cloud Nine.'","I love finding talents to pair my music with such as Conrad on 'Firestone', Parson James with 'Stole the Show,' and Will Heard on 'Nothing Left.'","I'd love to work with some of the people I've remixed for - Ed Sheeran or Chris Martin or The Weeknd. But it's not just big names like these guys that I want to collaborate with.","The opportunity to be a part of the closing ceremony of the Olympic Games in Rio is a huge milestone in my career, and it will be the biggest performance of my life.","2015 has been a crazy year for me, and Spotify have supported me right from the start. It's an honour to be their Breakout Artist of the year, and I'm super excited to see what we can do together in 2016!","It's a cool feeling to see how far my music has been spreading.","I really like streaming services. It's a great way for people to find your music.","I like to try to keep my music happy because it can make other people happy. And that's the way I feel when I listen to Avicii's songs. I get happy because his melodies are so happy.","I really like melodies.","I've really enjoyed working together with Apple to help launch their new streaming service. It is really cool to see Apple getting involved.","I think people were looking for something new in the EDM scene and found it in my music.","When I'm on the road and it's super stressful, it definitely affects my music. When I'm hanging out with my friends and my girlfriend and things are good in my life, then it's better.","All my collaborations happen in different ways. Sometimes it's through a chance meeting at a festival or event, while others can happen just off the back of me liking their music and reaching out.","To finally be able to actually play the piano with vocalists and actually do, like, a proper concert - that feels really good.","When I started making my tracks in the style that people call tropical house, I didn't do it on purpose to make it sound tropical. I made whatever I felt sounded good. I just wanted to make my own thing, and then suddenly people started calling it tropical ... I'm like, 'Yeah, that's probably a good name for it.'","I don't want to make just tropical house. I want to make everything, just like, whatever I feel like making.","I feel like when I get the demos - I get a lot of demos - but when I get the right demo, I get very inspired. I produce around it, and it often goes very fast.","What I really enjoy and what I do in the studio is play keyboard.","I like bringing keyboards and stuff on stage.","When I get up there, maybe I'm nervous for the first song, but then I get into it. It's a lot of fun to stand up there. I always enjoy the moment when I'm actually standing on stage. When I'm done, I'm like, 'Oh, I want to play one more song.'"],"Kyla Pratt":["Being pregnant is supposed to be the happiest time in your life.","I'm all about your mindset, being focused, staying positive, being optimistic, and knowing that these are all aspects of my life that I love and enjoy.","To see two couples that are battling to make it work just shows that love is in a marriage, but there are also trials and things that you have to make it through and showing women and men how to keep it spicy.","I'm the girl who's like, 'Why wear heels when I can wear tennis shoes and be comfortable?' I've always been the girl who's like, 'Let's go play basketball.'","For me, acting was a reward. I had to get good grades in order to act, in order to be on TV. I had to do well in school so I could work. To me, it was like an after-school activity, something to look forward to.","I like to do stuff for my brothers and sisters to appreciate because they look up to me, and for other kids around the world who want to get into acting or who just want to have somebody to look up to.","I think the main thing that I've learned while working on 'Let's Stay Together' is how to balance mommyhood and working.","I just feel like when a good project comes along, I'm not going to discriminate against it because it's television or because it's a film. I never want to say no to something just because of the area that it's in. If it's a good story or I think it's going to be exciting to play or exciting to be a part of, then I'm going to be a part of it.","I developed my own production company. I'm reading different books and writing, working on myself. I'm being focused on that, but also being focused on in front of the camera and balancing mommy life at the same time. I just want to continue to move forward.","I'm just focusing on 'Let's Stay Together' and slowly building my production company. I'm trying to get into writing as well.","I love what I do and being in front of the camera. But I never want to limit myself to just one thing and just venture out into new things."],"Kyla Reid":["Fingers crossed, you'll hear a lot more of me.","Dreams do come true if you work hard and you get your head down.","I've always been a fan of Drake's. I wouldn't say I listen to all of his music, but I would say that I pick tunes out of his that I love and then put them on repeat.","Any songs that I like, I sort of rinse them out.","I honestly felt someone was having me on when they were like, 'Drake wants you on this track.'","I'm never not singing.","I remember at one stage, I was like, 'Oh no. I'm going to be remembered as the 'Do You Mind' Girl.'","Aaliyah was one of my favourite artists.","When I was first going out to funky events, it was a lovely kind of music to dance to - it had such a nice vibe.","I got married and had a baby, so I was doing the mummy thing. I got hyperemesis and was only supposed to go away for maternity leave, but then it ended up being three or four years, and by that time, it was hard to get back into the music world, so when Drake called, it was the perfect opportunity.","I want to show everybody the diverse me and show people that I can do a tune on an R&B song, I can do a tune on a house song, I can do something on an Afrobeat. I really want to show that.","I love being a mom. I love singing. Why can't you have both? A lot of people would say you can't, but I think you can balance it; if you work hard, and you plan everything out properly, it works.","When I left school, I went and bought my own sound system, and me and my dad would just go along to all the pubs and clubs around the local area and just sort of do our own little cover shows."],"Kyle Abraham":["A lot of the time, when I'm choreographing, I'm not thinking about what movement look best next to the next movement - I'm actually thinking about what song and what sound sounds right next to the next thing. So kind of choreographing as if I'm always making a mix tape, so to speak.","I love Pittsburgh because it's a humble city. It's really grounded in its rich history and culture.","Middle and high school is a time of people telling you who you are before you know who you are. I was in advanced classes at Frick and Schenley, and people would say I was trying to be white because of the way I spoke. Or they'd say I was gay.","I didn't have good grades until I started dancing, because I didn't try - I didn't see the point. Once I realized why I wanted to go to college, I started to study and do well. I knew I had to have a certain GPA to get in.","Ralph Lemon is my idol. But music is my biggest passion. Frank Ocean's 'Pyramids' is on repeat. That kind of stuff with Frank Ocean makes me cry.","The first dance performance I saw was Joffrey Ballet doing 'Billboards' to Prince.","I started dancing in my room... I wanted to find out more about my movements. I wanted to elaborate on whatever it was that I was doing there.","I guess it's hard work... whatever the decision is, how to show it to people that aren't necessarily dancers, how to get people to think about more than themselves."],"Kyle Bornheimer":["I've been at this a long time, but commercials are what hit for me. Casting directors watch those commercials.","I don't find that I subscribe or believe in many rules about what comedy is and what makes it funny.","In high school, I tried to cook dinner for a girl, and it was horrific. It was at her house. I was trying to make pork chops with my mom's recipe, just trying to be Mr. Awesome, like, 'Yeah, I cook, too.' But I just burned everything. There was smoke everywhere.","Even when they have a star that they're going after, casting directors love, if anything, just the excuse to see people. They like to have a dugout full of actors that they can go to.","My dad had a huge movie collection. So we all had a good sense of entertainment history. I was a Jack Lemmon fan more than most people from my generation.","For a year, I was the world's worst assistant to a talent manager. I was awful at it. Really disorganized. Just not the person you want at the front desk of your office.","I played a waiter on 'Will & Grace,' a waiter on 'Medium' and on 'Weeds.' They all got cut out. I'm an awful waiter in real life. Maybe I was an awful waiter on screen, too."],"Kyle Chandler":["I really love to ride my motorcycle. When I want to just get away and be by myself and clear my head, that's what I do.","Opportunity does not knock, it presents itself when you beat down the door.","If you're not really having a good time, it's not worth it.","I've stopped racing to get to the red light.","I love the institution of marriage, and I love my marriage.","What I do is not rocket science, but I sure do love it.","I did play two years of high school football and was very short and uncoordinated but the second year I was very tall and skinny and very uncoordinated.","I grew up in Chicago, so I've always been a Bears fan. Dad used to take me to Bears games and Cubs games. My brother used to ride me over to Lake Forest College on his Honda Supersport and we'd watch the Bears practice. I remember those guys out there as monsters - they were the biggest things I've ever seen!","What, am I supposed to run around in a little red cape and save the world?","I love playing a role where I think I'm right and then you learn you're not. And it's what you do with that information.","Look, isn't there any way you can just stamp me as not crazy and let me get outta here.","My grandparents got married at a very young age, and a lot of what I think about marriage is based on their relationship. I watched them over the years and saw how they dealt with everything together, as a team.","Austin is such a free and creative place, but I can't enjoy it as much because everyone I love is back in L.A.","When you walk out of your house in the morning, you don't know what you're going to see.","The only reason anyone ever called me a hero is because I get this paper, here.","I do like to cook; I'm sort of a mad scientist in the kitchen.","We run into some pretty tough arguments sometimes, but the idea is that at the end of the day, my wife and I realize that we'll always be holding each other's hand. This is a lifelong relationship, and after 12 years she hasn't gotten rid of me yet.","I don't think I had a script on 'King Kong.' But usually you read a script and then you go and audition for it. It's rare when there's no script. I sort of like the latter better, because I'm more successful at it.","I always treat all the jobs I do as an acting class.","We ended up moving out to Texas. We live outside of Austin. We've got a couple horses, we've got three miniature donkeys, we've got four dogs. Miniature donkeys are very warm, loving animals.","Oh, man, if in real life I was as cool and suave as Coach Taylor and had all the answers, things would be easier.","One way I differ from my character, Coach Taylor, is that I never would have taken this faraway job without my wife's consent.","I can gab with pretty much anyone.","I think that sense of humor is important in marriage. A sense of humor gets people through marriage.","I was never upset that I did not get an Emmy. That I did get an Emmy nomination, I couldn't be happier and prouder.","High school was interesting, because I went from a public school middle school to an academy where the first year we were doing Latin, chemistry, biology. I mean, I was woefully unprepared for the type of study.","My wife, she likes to have things uncluttered, and if something is missing, then one has to be very careful not to ask her if it was thrown out - you have to ask her simply where it might be.","Marriage is hard work, period.","I grew up in Chicago, so I've always been a Bears fan.","Every actor wants to be everybody - play all the roles.","I just went and saw 'Crazy, Stupid, Love.' Julianne Moore - I've been in love with her since 'Boogie Nights.' But also, 'The Big Lebowski.'","Thank goodness I've saved my money.","I'm in a great position now where I've got recognition. I'm not recognized too much. I think I'm recognized enough by the industry.","Television, cable, features are always out there.","Everything moves a little quicker in Los Angeles.","I work six months and get three or four with the family.","I own my own time.","Sometimes a scene may be about one thing, and it may end up still being about that, but the emotionality of it comes from somewhere else, or the humor of it comes from somewhere else, and it gives it that real-life quality.","I just can't say enough about the actors having faith and trust in the writers and the writers having faith and trust in the actors.","I don't want to say I'm never going to direct again, but directing's hard work.","It's much more enjoyable being an actor.","I also played two years of high school football but I wasn't very, how shall I say it, talented.","I love playing a role where I think I'm right and then you learn you're not.","We run into some pretty tough arguments sometimes, but the idea is that at the end of the day, my wife and I realize that we'll always be holding each other's hand.","My grandparents got married at a very young age, and a lot of what I think about marriage is based on their relationship.","I'm in a great position now where I've got recognition. I'm not recognized too much.","I want to find material that piques my interest, keeps me outside the box and challenges me.","My daughter loves horses. My other daughter loves soccer.","I work six months and get three or four with the family. I've stopped racing to get to the red light.","When I'm around authority, I still feel like I'm 14 or 15 years old."],"Kyle D. Pruett":["Women had to deal with the men's response when the women wanted more time out of the home; men now must deal with the women's response as men want more time in.","It is undeniable that a woman's ability to stretch and pursue her total competence outside the home and get paid what she's worth for it makes for happier and more fulfilled women."],"Kyle Dunnigan":["I think a bird is the worst present you can give somebody because it's guilt-ridden. This animal has the gift of flight, and you put it in a cage and watch it not do that until it dies.","I was bored at college, so I put $10 in a jukebox in this place where people played ping-pong and pool. I put in $10 of 'Jingle Bell Rock,' and this was back in the '90s, so it played 'Jingle Bell Rock,' like, 40 times in a row. It was just really fun to watch because after the fourth time, people were just losing-their-minds angry.","I think comedians start off as pranksters or something.","I just always wrote songs as a side hobby. So it was sort of a natural thing to write comedy songs. But when I started writing songs, I wrote very serious songs. Or things that a 13-14 year-old would think are very serious issues.","Every year, dads will dress up as Santa and try to surprise their kids by coming down the chimney, and every year, a dad gets stuck and dies.","I love doing different things where, for a little while, I can focus on standup then sketch writing, then performing, then directing a video. That, to me, is stimulating.","Very specifically, Nickelodeon is aimed at eight- and nine-year-olds.","I like to edit; I like to work with other people, and that's something stand-up doesn't really have.","My big influences are piano artists like Billy Joel and Elton John.","A pope going through a faith crisis would be funny to see."],"Kyle Edmund":["Training is very tough. I probably hurt and get out of breath more in training because in matches, you can hit an ace, then have 25 seconds off. In training, you're doing drills constantly.","In practice, there is no consequence. If you miss a ball, you just pick up another ball and serve again, or you come back the next day and play. In the matches, every point has got a consequence. If you lose, you don't come back the next day and play.","The tennis calendar is incredibly long, so it's normal to go through ups and downs, and you want to keep the ups as long as possible and the downs as short as possible. You have to be realistic with what you're doing.","I'd be walking off the court thinking I didn't put everything out there, which was the last thing I wanted, so I just went out there and focused on my game, and it worked out great. It's nice to know I can play at that level, but to do it week in, week out is a different challenge, and I want to be able to do that.","My training has always been a priority; whatever needs to be done will get done first before anything else. Social life will come after that. I still love being around friends and family, but with all the travelling overseas, it makes it very tough to fit in.","I like all kinds of music. On my playlist at the minute is Professor Green, Tinie Tempah, Maroon 5, Stereophonics, Jay-Z, Drake, and lots more. I always listen to music when I'm in the gym; it helps me to get pumped up.","When I was around the ages of 9, 10, and 11, I loved watching Marat Safin because I found his game exciting. Since he retired, I would say that my idol has been Andy Murray.","My phone is key. This is because I like listening to music, and often, not travelling with it would be a killer. I also love my bed, but unfortunately I can't travel with it, but if I could I would."],"Kyle Gallner":["Horror is a totally different animal. It's intense. You can do drama or comedies, but in horror, you really have to trick yourself into believing a lot of unbelievable phenomena.","I do not have a fear of heights at all. I was the kid who would see how high I could get in the trees. I was always climbing something. But I wasn't allowed to look down; I had to step off completely blind and backwards.","I am terrified of flying. I am a wreck right before I get on an airplane. That, and the ocean. I can only get in there for 10 minutes, I have this strong urge to run out and I won't go back in for the rest of the day. I've always been like that.","I play mostly bad guys on TV and mostly good guys in movies.","In TV, kid roles are like this: You're either in a couple minutes of an episode playing somebody's kid, or you get in these procedurals where you're crying or you're playing a witness or you're playing a crazy person. Every once in a while you get a big guest star role, but there's a formula to those TV shows."],"Kyle Hill":["A rainbow is the product of physics working for your appreciation of beauty.","We tend to accept information that confirms our prior beliefs and ignore or discredit information that does not. This confirmation bias settles over our eyes like distorting spectacles for everything we look at.","Most people would put me firmly in the nerd/geek category. It wouldn't be a change from where I've been put my whole life, but my place now has standing. Nerds are inexorably cool again.","Bullets are fast - even a 9-millimeter handgun launches lead at Mach 1. And the bigger the bullet gets, the more grains of gunpowder it carries, the faster it goes. Modern rifles can fling the small pieces of metal at half the velocity needed to escape the gravitational pull of the Moon.","Human atoms are the notes, their life the symphony.","When we overestimate the benefits of exercise, underestimate how many calories we eat, and overcompensate for a job well done, exercise is really a false protection from fattening food.","Thor is magical, yes, but it is the magic of reality. His hammer was crafted 'in the heart of a dying star,' but so were you! Most of the atoms that make you up are in fact the innards of a ball of gas in space that got so heavy that it exploded. Stars died so that you could live, as physicist Lawrence Krauss would say.","Reality is on a delay. For you, nothing is now. Realizing this fact is unsettling. If we can only react to the past, how do we manage to navigate the present? It's easy to spiral into a treatise on free will while in the fetal position, overthinking our forever past.","Whether we know it or not, each of our decisions is influenced by what we want to see or think.","Climate change denial, anti-vaccination proponents, creationist teachers, faith healers, fake bomb detector peddlers, psychic frauds, alternative medicine pushers... we need scientific thinking. We need a generation of kids who think an experiment is more important than a preconceived notion or an argument from authority.","Picking apart a story for its scientific underpinnings doesn't diminish it, it enhances it, makes us dream of the possibilities it proposes. I think appreciating the magic of reality, going from 'can't happen' to 'could happen,' is the fundamental appeal of science fiction.","You can do crunches all day long, and you abs will indeed get bigger and stronger, but you will never see them. The only way to see the muscles you work so hard for is to lose weight globally - across your entire body.","Jesus walking on water is an allegory, not fluid mechanics. God destroying the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah is a warning, not a historical battle. Doubting Thomas is an example, not a person. The story of Noah, with all of its scientific and historical impossibilities, can be read the same way.","What is basically just an IQ score has roots in education, socioeconomic status, genetics, and environmental factors. Looking at any one of these roots doesn't give you a full picture of the tree, but it does tell you that a tree is there.","The story of Noah is self-contradictory, uncorroborated by independent historical evidence, and is generally at odds with everything we know about our planet's geology, biology, and species diversity.","The disturbing truth about science communication is that we have theories and ways of delivering messages that really are like putting a candle to the dark, as Carl Sagan would say. We aren't sure what will work, when, or how much. But for all that uncertainty, that doesn't mean we shouldn't try.","Dragons are basically our pipe-dreams of what birds would be if they still looked liked ancient dinosaurs but followed evolution's flight plan.","Bigfoot does not exist because there would be evidence left behind - hair, feces, bones, kills, offspring, a carcass - if it did.","I have a save file in 'Final Fantasy XII' that is 125 hours long. I have gotten into legitimate arguments over the rules governing the tapping of mana in 'Magic: The Gathering.' I don't like hugs or parties, high school sucked for me, and Nathan Fillion deemed something I wrote his 'Favorite 'Firefly' fanboy rant to date.'","As any successful mad scientist will tell you, energy ain't free. Popular culture tends to forget this, instead focusing on the destructive capabilities of our finely crafted death rays without noting the massive energy expenditures required to use them.","No matter how many times you've seen the movies and the TV shows that have a protagonist leaping in the path of a bullet, physics forbids such sacrifice. Because of a bullet's radical speed, you can't jump in front of it, but you could get in its way. It's not as dramatic, but it does save lives.","The recipe for a human doesn't fill up a shopping list as you may suspect. Just twenty-two elements can describe almost all of the molecules that are, at this moment, you.","Evolution is ultimately why cancer is so deadly. Take two biopsies from different sides of a tumor, and they can be genetically very different, making it that much harder to fight. Variation is the toolbox of evolution, and this variation gives cancer strength.","Imagine how many women could excel in science if not for the pernicious myth that science and math are a man's game. Likewise, fitness isn't defined by the Arnold Schwarzeneggers of the world.","Why would you envy a man who doesn't know the names of all the planets, is a 'high functioning' sociopath, and has no friends? Because Sherlock Holmes thinks in all the ways we wish we could.","We are all cognitive misers. Our brains do not expend mental resources thoroughly examining problems when snap judgments will do.","Sherlock is a portrait of humanity - he takes nature's gift of thought and runs with it, bringing along all the human struggles, fears, and insecurities. He's the hero we could see ourselves being.","I was in China when Pokemon fever hit, and I got it bad. But as I got older, I didn't stay with it. My binder full of rares has since disappeared. I have refused to play the other games like the newest 'Pokemon X/Y' out of some misplaced hipster angst.","Making the leap from Monsanto's business practices - whatever you may think of them - to the 'dangers' of GM foods is a mistake in logical reasoning. It is akin to saying landscape paintings are potentially evil because the painter was a serial killer.","By calling GMOs 'poison' and 'evil,' Bill Maher poisons the well of reasoned scientific discussion with ideologically driven fear mongering.","It's fashionable to think that the conservative parties in America are the science deniers. You certainly wouldn't have trouble supporting that claim. But liberals are not exempt.","In science, the kind of evidence matters; all unlikelihoods are not created equal.","For peer review, replication, and objectivity to make any headway on the continuum, for science to find the right answers to anything, there have to be wrong - or at least unlikely - answers.","Science is a highly technical and intellectual endeavor. Any theory or fact or discovery has an ocean of depth to it. You can always go deeper with science, and you can always ask a new and interesting question. That's what makes a topic nerdy: depth.","Cancer is real-time evolution, and your body is the selective pressure.","If you wanted to travel backwards in time, you're out of luck. We have theories on how it might be possible to do so, but they all involve wormholes and black holes and other stuff that would probably kill you. If you want to travel forward in time, you just have to go really fast.","If a process or adaptation seems too smart for nature, that's a failure of your imagination, not the hand of God. I can make that claim because we have a working model of life's morphing and molding without it.","It is as though nature is a wonderful symphony that science sits in awe of. It looks closely at each player, how the tubas are tuned and how the strings are strung. Creationism lets out a loud 'shush' at such excitement. Just enjoy the show and stop asking questions.","We brick-and-mortar ourselves away from nature. The outside world is behind glass, underneath a slab of concrete, running through PVC. Our steel and concrete are suitable enough until nature comes knocking. And when she wants to get in, nothing can stop her.","It could be the case that all the studies supporting a warming planet are wrong; science always leaves that door open, but anthropogenic climate change remains the best explanation for a mountain of data that scientists have been poring over for a century.","Galileos still exist in science. Sometimes a lone proponent of a new idea turns out to be right.","Researchers may like to think that, given all the facts, we make rational choices. Ask economists how that assumption works out for them. No, we are emotional creatures who use value-based reasoning in conjunction with our rationality.","How the original 'Cosmos' affected me personally was long-term. I wasn't born early enough to see the original series, but after getting a hold of it in my teen years, it was one of the driving forces behind my passion for science.","Given the weight of an Oscar statuette, one made out of solid gold would be worth $219,000. That twinkle in a winner's eye would be more than just a realization that he or she is a decent actor; it would be the joy of holding a chunk of metal worth a new Lamborghini.","When the first episode of 'Mythbusters' aired in 2003, I couldn't drive a car. I couldn't see a R-rated movie. I was 14 years old, and I couldn't do much of anything. But 'Mythbusters' taught me that I could do science.","Raised on Bill Nye videos, LEGOs, and CD-ROMs of dinosaurs, I was a lump of nerdy clay waiting to be molded. 'Mythbusters' came to me at a critical time, and it transformed me into who I am today.","It's okay to take that reservoir of passion that you have and let it flow into whatever you love. Experiment, question, replicate, be critical, be nerdy, be yourself.","You can do yoga all day, you can run or bike or swim, but a pull-up will still be hard. It's not that you have to be a juiced-up 'lunk' to do one; it's a matter of physics.","People are misers of mental effort. If we don't have the interest or the capacity to look into the arguments, if the message isn't personally relevant, if we judge that we already know all we need to know about a topic, there is no reason to spend precious mental resources."],"Kyle Kinane":["The time that I have on this earth should just be filled with good times.","The exciting part about life is finding out what you can't do, because you don't find out until you try to do something and you're stopped.","Nobody mountain bikes anymore - or ever did - in comedy, so I have to go by myself.","Sometimes your dreams come true, and it's a real drag.","I think the problems with comedians that are political, and there are some brilliant ones, are the ones that offer no solutions. Not that there's a moral obligation for a comic to fix things, but I like to see a comic that's upset about something and offer a solution. It can be a funny solution. I like to see the thought process.","I am somehow allowed by the universe to do exactly what I want to do to make a living.","I try to stay away from calling people nerds or whatever, because I've got my own fetishes and interests.","I was raised Catholic in the Midwest, so I can't enjoy anything.","I'm glad I'm a comedian. Otherwise, my life would just be a series of undocumented low points.","The category I come closest to is 'lumberjack hipster.'","I like to challenge myself not to be negative, because it's easy to take comedy to a negative place and criticize the outside world. Trying to praise something through comedy or be appreciative and making jokes about it is more challenging than cutting things down.","Sometimes I realize halfway through a story, I'm like, 'Why would anyone care about this? It's uninteresting.'","I now get to have the life I wanted when I was 18 years old. Now, I'm like, 'I can buy any skateboard I want.'","I know what I like, and I'm not trying to adapt to new things.","Young writers take themselves very seriously in college.","I think I told my parents I wanted to be a writer, just so they'd kind of think I had some direction in life. It made it easier to pick out classes at college, like, 'Oh, this is writing classes, that's what I'm doing.'","When I lived in Chicago, I didn't like it. It's nice to visit.","I still love a well-crafted joke. Twitter's been great for that.","I'm hardly a known name, but I don't want to go, like, 'Oh, people call me a storyteller comedian, let me just go up and just talk about my day.' I don't want that to happen.","In 2007, I had on-paper success. I got to go to that Aspen comedy festival, which was pretty exclusive, I guess. Then I did Carson Daly. That was enough validation.","My theory on politics is no one really knows how it works, so I choose not to comment on stuff too outside of my league.","I don't want to make it a hard, fast rule, but it's surprising how many 'fun for the whole family' acts are real scumbags. The people that confess they're scumbags on stage are generally really great people. They're more honest with the audience with who they are."],"Kyle MacLachlan":["Becoming a father increases your capacity for love and your level of patience. It opens up another door in a person - a door which you may not even have known was there. That's what I feel with my son. There's suddenly another level of love that expands. My son is my greatest joy, out of everything in my life.","My workout is my meditation.","I believe in fate. Sometimes that means an old bearded guy sitting on a cloud and pulling the strings; sometimes it means random atoms swirling through a cheerless universe; sometimes it means everything being preordained thanks to your karma credit from your previous lives.","The most appealing thing to me about food is combining and layering flavors, tastes, and textures. So the perfect sandwich has to be toasted. It has to have Emmenthal Swiss cheese and a combination of sweet and savory - some cranberry or fig thing happening - with different kinds of meats like Black Forest ham and roast beef.","When I think of 'Mad Dog Time,' I think of the fact that I got to drive fast cars all day long up in Canada. That was really fun. We were on these back roads with these great cars.","Lynch is not as strange as his films. He's a complex guy with a very interesting view of the world. But he's very accessible, with a good heart.","Even after doing that TV thing, 'Roswell,' I'm still waiting to see my first UFO.","I'd love to visit South America, especially Argentina, as I'm a winemaker myself. They do a fantastic malbec, so it would be a dream to sample their grapes. New Zealand would be great, too. I'm a golfer, so it would combine both my loves.","I am a big one for subtlety and empathy. My dad was softly spoken and didn't carry his honours and accomplishments for everyone to see.","I originally wanted to be an opera singer. I studied classical voice at the University of Washington but soon realised I didn't have the instrument or the discipline. The road for opera singers is more difficult than for actors.","Hamlet is a little daunting.","I get very caught up with things. I used to be dominated by domestic things. I had a lovely house in LA-and it became this growing, mad obsession.","I always think of the Pacific Northwest as giant trees and rain and clouds and dampness, like the Native American art from that area. That all says Pacific Northwest to me. Salmon. It really only exists on the Western side of the Cascades.","I try to travel as light as possible to avoid baggage issues. Los Angeles airport is notorious for baggage delays, so I'll often FedEx a suitcase ahead or back so I don't need to stand around; it also minimises problems at check-in.","My breakfast consists of two cappuccinos and maybe a toasted English muffin, and that's pretty much it for me unless I decide to go a little more upscale, and then I'll have scrambled eggs.","Actors have an unusual perspective on clothing. You've really got to know the impact of what you're wearing on the character you're playing.","Hollywood is not good when it comes to age.","I questioned everything. I didn't see a character developed in Platoon at all. The character in Blue Velvet was much more fascinating to me.","I really fight for my privacy.","I'd like to do more Shakespeare. I'd like to do Iago in Othello. I look so benign. It would be interesting to see that black evil come out of my soul.","I've done Graham Norton's show three times now. He tackles taboos and subject matter that wouldn't make it past the censors in the States.","The difference with doing a play is that you are in control. In film you are in the hands of the director and the editor and the producer.","The film world is a crazy place to be. You sit around all day waiting for the phone to ring. Are people talking about you or aren't they?","The Monmouth Coffee Shop is the best place in London.","The nice thing about New York is that you're finally able to wear those winter clothes that have been sitting in your closet in mothballs.","I like to go and watch 'Blade Runner,' which made no sense but which I loved going into that world. I think people loved going into the world of 'Dune' with all of its problems.","I'm proud of 'The Hidden.' I feel like we took a B-movie and kind of turned it into an A-minus action movie. We kind of elevated the material a little bit. It's got a great car-chase scene at the very beginning. It has some terrific moments in it, some funny stuff. It's a great rental.","'Dune' was like a giant machine, and it was hard to keep track of all the pieces, but 'Blue Velvet' was a very sleek, compact little experience.","I've always enjoyed drinking wine, ever since I was in college. My appreciation really took off when I began to visit Napa. I was toying with an idea of making wine in Napa, but it's prohibitively expensive, and the competition is fierce.","Working on 'Housewives' was very similar to 'Sex and the City.' Different cities, of course, but a high level of talent in the writing and acting on both!","When I started acting, my whole focus and intention was to work as a stage actor in a company where you're asked to different roles - do a comedy, do a tragedy, etc. I haven't had any reservations about jumping from one type of genre to another.","The way 'Showgirls' was presented to me, it sounded like an interesting project, and it kind of just went off the rails as we were doing it.","I did a little movie called 'Touch of Pink,' where I played a Cary Grant-type guy, which I thought was a lot of fun, and I thought I was moderately successful in my own interpretation of Cary Grant.","Walla Walla is where I make wine, with Eric Dunham. He and I partnered up on a small project for me. We make pretty good cabernet and syrah.","'Portlandia' is the most fun show. When I get a breakdown of what the arc of the story is going to be, I could never in my wildest dreams anticipate the direction.","Most actors are pretty adaptable because we work with so many directors.","When the audience first sees Cooper talking into his tape recorder at the beginning of 'Twin Peaks,' I think that's the greatest introduction to a character I've seen in my career. It tells you everything about the guy right there in a few minutes as well as bringing up a whole load of questions.","The fact 'Twin Peaks' had a life at all took most of us in the cast by surprise. We thought it would be too unusual for network television. The original intention was that it would be a two-hour movie. If the network didn't want to pick it up as a series, it could just show that. But ABC took a chance.","Everyone has their 'Showgirls.' We remember the great films actors have been in, and the rest get forgotten. But occasionally, people like to revisit the ones that get swept aside.","David Lynch plucked me from obscurity. He cast me as the lead in 'Dune' and 'Blue Velvet,' and people have seen me as this boy-next-door-cooking-up-something-weird-in-the-basement ever since. I was 23 when I first met him, in his bungalow on the Universal lot, and could never have predicted we would have such an enduring relationship.","I like eating, cooking and shopping. It all goes together.","When I went back home to Seattle after filming 'Dune' in Mexico, I thought, 'Did this really happen?'","A lot's riding on 'Dune,' and my friends in Seattle realize what's happening if I freak out a bit. They accept whatever I happen to be, and they tell me when I'm slipping out of Kyle. They call me the 'God Emperor of the Universe.'","I'm a pretty organised packer, laying out everything beforehand, as I don't like to take extra stuff. I've got a good eye for judging how much I can stuff into one suitcase. I've often not brought the right items, but I'd never avoided a chance to shop, unlike most men.","When I'm in a foreign city, I like to get to know it like a local.","I never felt that my life was not complete without a child. I don't know if that, as a younger man, I'd have had full appreciation for it.","Becoming a parent expands you as a human being. I am having the most wonderful time. You've married, but the addition of a child strengthens and deepens everything.","Looking at 70 from 49, I don't see it slowing me down. Maybe I'll need a nap during the day! I'm thinking when I'm 85 I'll settle down a bit. But I'm going to fight, kicking and screaming, every step of the way.","I think most actors feel an obligation to do right by the people they're playing.","My first-ever visit to a cheese factory was in Tillamook Washington... yes, I am that nerdy.","My first album was The Doobie Brothers... 'Captain and Me.' You always remember your first!","Sometimes for an afternoon snack, I'll get some tortilla chips and half an avocado, and I'll just eat that like guacamole.","I have an avocado tree at my place in Los Angeles - it's the smoother-skinned one, which tends to be a little stringy. Often the birds or raccoons get the avocados before I can harvest them. I have figs, too, which are great with prosciutto, of course. I have limes and lemons, which I use to make lemonade.","It's amazing to think of the nutritional responsibility you have in cooking for a kid, which then makes you wonder if you're getting enough yourself.","If I'm going to make something in the kitchen, even if it's something as simple as a sandwich, I will take the extra time to make it a great sandwich instead of just an average sandwich. I don't mind investing a little extra work to make something special.","I have olive trees and have tried my hand at curing small batches of olives, with varying degrees of success. So sometimes there are leftover olives I use in pasta sauce because they didn't quite make the grade.","I think my wife married me for my guacamole.","I've got German, Cornish and Scottish ancestry. It might help explain my affinity for forests, the sea, and fatty foods."],"Kyle Massey":["You never know where life is going to take you. So everything I do, I just take it one day at a time, and it always leads you to the right place.","I just like to hop up on the dance floor and do my thing.","People have been watching me since I was eight. They've been watching me grow up, so they feel that connection with me.","I support Children's Hospital of Los Angeles through Disney Channel and Britti Cares International in support of children with various diseases and illnesses and donate my time with pride and dignity.","Working with animals forces an actor to work harder because you have to be quick when it comes to improvisation, and you can't break character - at all.","My brother, Chris Massey from 'Zoey 101', was acting first at a young age. I just followed in my sibling's footsteps."],"Kyle Mooney":["'Nathan for You' was my first time being in a writer's room, really.","I guess I always have been a collector.","I am the youngest of three boys, and I was super-informed by what the older ones were into.","I've always been kind of deep into thrifting and secondhand clothing.","I feel like I've got a pretty relatively extensive Christmas sweatshirt collection.","I still watch TGIF shows like 'Family Matters.'","A lot of my characters are people who are, in essence, lying to themselves. They present one thing, when in reality they're another thing. Maybe they're not as tough or as cool as they want to be.","It's always exciting to create a character that people can relate to, where people are like, 'Oh, I know this dude,' but maybe you've never actually seen this type of character on TV.","Adam Sandler, Mike Myers, Dava Carvey, Eddie Murphy, Will Ferrell - they're all the best.","Whenever anybody says what you do isn't good, it's always unflattering and makes me feel uncomfortable. But when the person who's in charge of the United States of America says, 'Not good,' I'm like, 'Oh.' It's a little unflattering.","Generally, I'm attracted to videos that hit me some way nostalgically.","The Christian kids' movies are fun because so many of them are made with low production value, but they're still trying to appeal to a broad audience like a Sesame Street or something. It's always fascinating to see how hidden or obvious they want to make their message. Also, the acting in them can be pretty fun.","I'm always pretty influenced by stuff from when we were younger."],"Kyle Schmid":["This past year has been something else... it's opened my eyes to many things and many people. It's had its ups and downs and ins and outs. And I believe we've all been able to take something from that and grow in our own imparticular ways. We've over come obstacles, and set in motion opportunities that can change our own individual lives.","The first day was memorable for me. I walked into this studio with these giant eyes, slowly met everybody and got to see the story boards and sketches of our characters. I got the see the sets and was just amazed that all this was to be something we all were going to be part of for almost a year.","I have a group of four or five friends that I consider my friends and best friends and people that I want to hold onto for the rest of my life.","I'm petrified of spiders. I hate them. I sleep with a glass of water beside my bed every night. I woke up once to take a sip of water and almost swallowed a dead one floating in the glass.","I'd like to guest star on 'Game of Thrones.' I love period pieces and dark material. I think the show has a good balance of that and some solid characters.","I haven't modelled since I was 12 - that was a one-time thing, and I did it as a kid to make a little money to save up for university. Acting is my first love as well as writing and eventually producing and directing.","Soccer is my first love. I've been playing since I was 4 years old. I traveled the world doing it. I broke my leg when I was 16 or 17, and acting kind of filled the void.","We all are who we are. We're not necessarily good, and we're not necessarily bad. So much television, in the writing, is so one-dimensional, in that aspect, where you have your good guys and you have your bad guys."],"Kyle Secor":["Fresh blood is always good.","I have close friendships, deep bonds with men.","I can have more of a normal life in Los Angeles, where I can be fairly anonymous.","First it was football, then basketball. I still think about going back to college and playing basketball. Another romantic thing was that I wanted to join the Army, but it was only because I loved the uniforms.","Yoga is sort of like acting because it's something you don't really know about - how it happens, why it works. You just do the poses, and you get the benefits. I like sharing that. And I think I have a talent for touching people, getting them in tune with their bodies.","I had a feeling '86 would be a good year."],"Kyle Shewfelt":["Honestly, it's not the medals that I feel so proud of. It's the way I conducted myself as an athlete, the hard work that I put forward.","Not only is yoga excellent for flexibility, but it is also a great tool for longevity and injury prevention, as it allows for internal body awareness.","I've always lived my gymnastics career with a lot of passion and a lot of purpose.","I was fully immersed in the now as an athlete.","I was so focused and so driven, there was this fire inside of me that was burning so brightly.","It's important to feel settled and balanced in life, and that has been tough for me to do.","Life never works out the way you think it will. But you just have to deal with it.","When I look towards my future, I want to leave a legacy that runs rich.","I want to make a difference.","I want to contribute to sport and the community in a positive way.","I have no regrets. Not a single one.","I'm on a missionary journey to become the best version of myself.","I really want to feel that I'm in a very balanced and good place in my life. And I do feel that. But I think it's always important to learn and draw little bits of inspiration from wherever we can.","The Olympics is about letting people believe in their own dreams.","The unknown is very scary."],"Kylie Bax":["Modeling, for me, isn't about being beautiful but creating something interesting for people to look at and think about.","Always wear a smile sometime during the day - it makes you feel happier and look younger.","Greece is the most magical place on Earth.","Some tell me I'll break my ankle on my high heels - but I live in them. I'm known for doing speed dashes and leaps and bounds in heels. No problem.","I stayed away from mirrors when I was younger and I didn't like having my picture taken. I was tall and had braces and felt ugly.","I love it when a photographer lets me create my own movement and feeling to the images. By that I mean he doesn't restrict me in his or her own ideas but rather gives me a direction and lets me work within those boundaries freely.","I like to walk around my apartment naked. I like sitting around in the nude watching sports, actually.","My greatest fear is flying. And I do a lot of flying, so that's a bummer.","I wish I had more hair on my head. Maybe if I sprinkled fertilizer on it, it would grow.","I'm working on just finding a boyfriend right now.","I can pull a bone out of my shoulder and dislocate it.","I wish I had Wonder Woman's magic lasso like her to make people tell the truth.","If we can send a man to the moon, then why don't we send a woman?","I want my children and grandchildren to see what I look like now.","I never feel comfortable modeling when I'm pregnant, even if I'm not showing.","My mother was a beauty queen in her hey day. That's where I learnt a little about makeup and hair... I had never picked up or even seen a 'Vogue' before I was 17. I had no idea about fashion, magazines, models or designers. No idea.","My first child, I think I was completely shell shocked. I was ecstatic but in shock that I was now responsible completely for another life and it was my co-creation and how did I manage that?! I was in awe that I had actually done what millions of other women had done, given birth and now an added responsibility of 'mommy' in my life ahead!","Kiwis must not fall behind the standards of other countries. We pride ourselves on our quality of life. Thus we must pave the road in the right way for the future generations.","I don't admire one particular style, but for evening events, I always look to Grace Kelly for inspiration.","Most of my friends are male. Men are more fun.","I'm not a hat person. I really don't like wearing things on my head.","My aim and my passion is to own and breed race horses."],"Kylie Bunbury":["I was a tomboy growing up, so I think I naturally take on a little male swagger.","I'm black, so I should be able to play a 'thug?' No. Hello. Open your mind. I'm a person that believes in breaking barriers.","When you have haters, you're doing something right.","I just want people to remember I'm not perfect. I just try to lead with love every day.","I normally play very serious characters.","I gravitate towards strong messages and things that make an impact.","I never want to change. I get nervous about that... people thinking that I've changed just because the circumstances of my life have.","I grew up in an athletic family. My dad played and my brother currently plays professional soccer, so I'm athletic.","I firmly believe everyone needs to have balance in their life.","I'm a woman of color, but I have so many different cultures inside of me.","Living courageously in your uniqueness is really important: just being completely yourself. I know that sounds really cliche, but just do what you want to do.","I would love to do something that takes me on an adventure. I really want to do it all.","When it comes to sports, it requires a lot mentally and physically.","I played basketball; I ran track and also played soccer. I think that I am naturally athletic.","Young girls need to see women who are strong and vulnerable and complex onscreen.","I want to be a good actress, I want to be a good person, and I want to play baseball.","I know me. I only have brothers, and I know that I would do anything for them, and I would back them up to the ends of the Earth.","I always say that fashion is a thing that I'm going to get into at some point.","I still have a lot of moments where I don't feel worthy.","What I look for in a role is a woman who is important - not on the sidelines, not arm candy: women who do important things.","I think that TV and film are very important mediums to show what people of all races, ethnicities, sexual orientations can do, and I think that, as women, we are still in the process of proving what we can do, what we can accomplish, and who we are.","When all you've done is work toward being a professional athlete, and then you injure yourself, and you know that you're going to be out for a while, it's gut-wrenching. It almost feels like your life is over because that's all you've ever worked for.","I did this film called 'Prom.' It was a Disney movie. And at that point, I didn't know what the hell I was doing. I had no idea how to act. It was purely instinctual. I just remember the first scene I did and the first take, it feeling so right.","I was born in Canada, and then my dad played pro soccer in England and then also on an island off the coast of Portugal. So we lived there for, like, 10 years. And then we moved to Minnesota. So I feel like I've experienced a lot of different cultures, and I'm still figuring out who I am.","I sing. I used to think singing is going to be the route, and I still sing to this day. I still try to write lyrics.","I just really love to do new things and experience new things.","I think pressure is good. Just watching my brother and my dad be professional athletes, I think pressure has driven them and has caused them to excel more.","I'm pretty proud of my fastball. I can throw a screwball. It's not as accurate, and I don't have the velocity like I do with my fastball, but I think my fastball is not too shabby.","I do feel I have a responsibility to empower women and to inspire them.","I grew up with brothers, so I very easily get along with men.","I really feel like the proper representation of women, in TV and film, is really important and vital.","I've always wanted to know what it's like to be the first to do something.","I think any player, as a rookie coming into any sport, has to prove themselves.","As time goes on, we suppress our dreams, which really makes me sad.","Child actors are notorious for being brats.","All you need is heart, work ethic, and to dream big.","If I can learn how to pitch in two months, and I'm doing OK, how can we not assume that a woman who's been working on it for her entire life won't be playing in the MLB? It's ridiculous.","Baseball wasn't necessarily my first sport in terms of liking it. I'd never played baseball or softball growing up.","I think the biggest thing that I learned, and why I've fallen in love with baseball, is how mental of a game it is. It's such a mental sport, and it's beautiful. I think definitely the mental aspect, the stats, and the mathematics, that, to me, really blew me away.","I'm an athlete in general.","I get very agitated if I don't get something right away.","I knew my focus was going to be somewhere in the arts. I've always painted. I've always sung. I didn't know when or how it was going to happen - or what it was going to be.","Because our father played professional soccer, being in the spotlight never felt weird to me and my brother. We always felt we could do anything.","It's incredibly important to my spirits and mental health that I come back to Minnesota and not be surrounded constantly with Hollywood life. Spending time in the backyard, helping out in the garden, going out to the lakes, reminds me of what's important and allows me to realign myself.","I want to feel like I'm beautiful because I'm me.","I know I'm known for dramas, but around my family and friends, I'm really goofy! Not saying I'm necessarily funny, but I'm very goofy.","It's important that we're properly represented and for viewers to see all the bits and pieces of being a woman of color.","For me, I've always wanted to portray roles that are empowering. Also, being empowering doesn't necessarily mean being strong all the time.","In terms of being a vessel for female empowerment and a role model for young girls, I take it on gladly and seriously, but I hope people remember that I'm just a regular person, and I'm not going to be perfect.","I think it's really important that we see women represented properly in TV, and that's a multi-dimensional person: a real human being who's flawed, who's weird, who's awesome.","I grew up watching the Williams sisters. I did a lot of research on Serena and kind of stole some things from her."],"Kylie Jenner":["I've realized through the years that I just find happiness in other things, whether it's my dogs or my friends or, like, looking at the sunset. So if I were to wish for something else, it would just to be happy all the time, to have a superpower of not letting things affect me, and to be true to who I am, always.","I definitely think prom should feel sophisticated. I'm not really into cutouts and all that. I would go for a more simple look - maybe a dark-colored dress and a red lip and long wavy hair; and for nails, a French tip is always classic and cute!","Every time I start to get worked up over something, I just think to myself, 'Is this really going to matter in my life tomorrow, in an hour, in a year?' You just can't get stressed about the little things 'cause it's just not worth it at the end of the day.","I like to have fun, I'm silly, and I keep the mood light.","If you're different, or if you think something about you is just weird and out of the ordinary, I just think that's so dope.","I change my style maybe every month. I'm, like, punk one month, ghetto fab the next, classy the next. I'm just young and finding out who I am.","What I think is so amazing about having everything, and feeling like I have everything, is that I don't really find happiness within materialistic things. Like, it's cool if I can buy myself a new car, and I think it's amazing for a week, but then the thrill is over, and I'm like, 'Oh, so I guess that wasn't really happiness.'","Every time I get my makeup professionally done, I take a photo.","I just want to inspire my fans to be whoever they want to be, because that's what I've always done.","I feel like I've lost so many amazing traits because I've listened to stupid people, ignorant people who are bullies.","People think they have a perfect idea of who you are from a four-second Snapchat video... and fake blogs, stories, magazine covers. In reality, that's not the case. Nobody knows who I am except family and my close friends.","It sucks being judged by the world instead of your close friends or family. I try to just realise that the only people who matter are my family and friends.","There is absolutely a side of me that people don't know. I'm not myself on Snapchat or Instagram. That's totally not me.","When I'm, like, 30, I want to go off the map, have a family and live in Malibu with a farm, and just raise my own chickens.","Having a reality TV show, everyone feels like they know you, but that's only 10% of my life. There's a whole other side of me that people don't see.","I'm not materialistic. I love clothes and all that stuff, but I don't need it to live.","I don't think I need a significant other to be happy because I always like to find that for myself, but I think that it makes me a lot happier when I'm sharing my life with somebody.","I don't want to be a bad role model.","I'm ready to live on my own. It's a really big step, but I'm ready.","I'm a brand ambassador. I've been a fan of Nip+Fab for a while, so it fit perfectly. I just love their stuff.","I want to explore a lot of things, do acting here and there.","I love L.A. I'm such an L.A. person.","The more people love you, the more there's going to be people that hate you.","I know how influential I am over my fans and followers. I feel like everything I do, my hair color, my makeup, I always start these huge trends, and I don't even realize what I'm capable of.","I don't really follow trends - I don't like wearing what other people are wearing. I just like to be original!","I don't really wear perfume. I use Victoria's Secret sometimes. They have this Coconut Passion spray. But fragrances can give me a bit of a headache.","There are new rumors about me every day.","Everyone asks, 'What's your favorite trend?' And I never answer that.","I love to dance, so I'm definitely always the first one out on the dance floor. And when it comes to guys, I don't get shy. So if I wasn't with a date, I wouldn't have a problem going up to a guy and just saying, 'Are you gonna dance with me?' Trust me, it'll work for you too! Guys like it when you aren't afraid to make the first move.","I swear there are things you can do to work on problem areas without having to think about plastic surgery.","I'll usually wash my face with a face wash, then I'll go to my makeup. I like to use Nip + Fab Dragon's Blood Fix Serum. It's moisturizing and also a great primer for your makeup. And, I try to use sunscreen every day.","Khloe has the youngest hands. You can tell a woman's age by her hands, and she taught me that. She has way younger hands than I do because she's addicted to wearing sunscreen on them. I'm not consistent with it, but maybe that will be my new year's resolution.","I honestly hate wearing makeup.","I'm always down to share my secrets, share my beauty tips. Most of the stuff my fans never knew I get from CVS and stores like that. It's fun sharing all the stuff that I use! I don't use crazy stuff. There's always ways to do it for less.","I take, like, 500 selfies to get one I like.","I still do Juvederm for my lips. I go to Dr. Ourian in Beverly Hills. He's the best, and he's super natural about it.","Since I was 9 years old, I've been in the entertainment business, and everyone is always telling me what - and what not - to do... you just get a tough skin and have to not care about what people think, or you will not end up in a good place.","I've been bullied my whole life, whether it was about my peers or comments on Instagram or Twitter, whatever. And I never talked about my story, really. I feel like I've kind of accepted it because I realized that just comes with the territory.","I feel like, growing up, I haven't had a lot of room for error - I don't have room to make mistakes. You need to make mistakes to grow and learn, but I'm just a little different because the world is watching me, every single thing I do.","I still feel insecure all the time. I feel like it's just a part of being a human being... I just learned normal is very boring.","I think that other girls and boys my age will maybe see that I'm so accepting and be accepting of other people, too.","I never feel pressure to be a good role model. I always try to do my best to inspire people to be good and do the right thing, but I just can't live my life always trying to be a good role model.","I have a lot of boots. I'm a shoe person for sure.","I'm obsessed with Lady Gaga. I saw her at the Alexander Wang fashion show after-party, and I think she's the nicest person ever.","I'm way flashier on Instagram and Snapchat because I feel like that's what people want to see, and that's I've always done, so I'm not going to stop. People want to see my cars and my purses. People love fashion. But that's so not me.","I'm scared of the day I turn 19. I really don't want to grow past 18.","I wake up every morning at, like, seven or eight because I think that there's a bad story about me, and I have to check. My worst fear is waking up and finding something bad about me on the Internet.","I can't sleep in my makeup. Sometimes I'll be really lazy and try to not think about it and just fall asleep, but I have to take it off and as soon as possible. Sometimes it'll be quick.","I really like the Glycolic Cleansing Pads because they're super easy. Sometimes it's annoying to scrub your face with your hands, but these are just little pads, so I like that. I also really like the Kale Fix Moisturizer and Dragon's Blood Fix Serum. The Dragon's Blood is good for priming before your makeup.","I wake up every morning with the worst anxiety. I don't know why. I have, like, a problem.","My fans and followers are so amazing.","Working with some of the best makeup artists has taught me a lot of amazing tricks to making me feel more confident, and I can't wait to share them with you guys.","Honestly, what I think set everything off is when I cut my hair off when I was 16 and dyed it blue. After that, I just felt so free and wanted to experiment with my look.","I'm young, and I'm a girl, so, when I post something, I want to see what people are saying or what they think of my photos. I've found it better if you don't read anything and you just always stay off that track.","I feel limited in some ways because I have such young fans. But I'm okay with that; I do everything I want to do.","If I'm going to see people, I won't wear heavy makeup. It's not attractive on me. When you see those pictures on my Instagram, they are usually for when I'm doing a photo shoot or an interview.","People flash back to pictures of me when I was 12 and say 'Kylie's so different,' but how can I look the same from 12 -18?","I like lip liners over lipsticks. I have so many of them from so many different brands, so I just pick the color that works.","I can't have brown hair for some reason. I don't think it goes with my skin tone. The second I see it turn brown in the sun, I dye it black - the blacker the better.","I feel like I'm way too young to wear such heavy makeup all the time. It's just bad for your skin, but I'm always doing photo shoots or red carpets and events, so I obviously want to look good.","People have to be sensitive to - I hate using the word 'celebrities' - people in the spotlight. Because there's so much more than what you see on the cover of a magazine.","Having sisters is the best. I have a different relationship with each of them. I go to Kim for fashion advice, Khloe is always boy and family advice, and Kourtney is like another mother to me.","I wanted a house near my family in a quiet neighborhood with a front yard and a backyard that my dog will like.","I follow all these fashion blogs that are cool and inspire me. I'm not really obsessed with anyone except for the people that I like romantically. I get excited when they post. Sometimes I like to stalk my exes.","Tyga's one of my best friends ever, so it's so much fun to travel with him. I always like having my friends out on the road with me.","I've been picked on my whole entire life, and I feel like I started the IAmMoreThan campaign on Instagram to try to find other people who have been bullied and totally overcame it and did something amazing with it.","Lips are kind of like my thing, and I've always been obsessed with lipstick and lip liner. I just always went to lip liner to overline my lips, and I feel like I was really known for that. I can't walk out of my house without my lipstick!","I don't want my fans to think they have to get lip fillers or look like me in any way.","I have normal friends. I sit at my house, and they practically live with me, and I watch them get ready to go to a high school party, hang out with their friends, go to concerts.","I have two really great best friends that are the only people I hang out with. I keep a close circle.","I'm still in school - I'm home-schooled. I do school every day. I finish in, like, four months.","Makeup looks better if your skin is not dry. And sometimes, if my skin peels, then it's all just bad. Basically, take care of your skin to make your makeup look nice.","I will take off my makeup with wipes and then wash my face again. Then, I use a toner, moisturizer, and under-eye cream. I love vitamin E oil and coconut oil.","I love Armani Face Fabric, Make Up For Ever HD, Rodial Skin Tint and Charlotte Tilbury.","I definitely don't make many friends. It's my choice; I just have a wall. It's not that I have anything against anyone."],"Kylie Minogue":["I do quite naughty things now. I do like to be a bit sexy.","This is such a special summer holiday for me. I haven't known myself so relaxed in years.","I love to have a bath with beautiful, relaxing music on and have no rush to do anything. It's a wonderful indulgence, and it helps me to calm down and stop my mind running overtime.","There's no shortcut to learning a craft; you just have to put the years in.","I'm a very proud Australian, always bragging about our country wherever I am in the world.","The point of my job is to entertain and make it look easy, so I guess it's the parts you don't often see which make me feel proud. All the behind the scenes work, the fears and insecurities I have to face and overcome to improve myself as a person and performer, all of the people who believe in me and encourage me.","I wrote lyrics that were intensely personal to me a few years ago. Maybe people know me better now.","With one man, there was a freedom and liberation. That was with Michael Hutchence, my partner in life.","I think I'm being friendly with someone and I'll sit in their lap. They think I'm flirting with them.","I have had a holiday, and I'd like to take it up professionally.","You need a lot of luck to find people with whom you want to spend the rest of your life. Some people manage to find their soul mate. Others don't. I think love is like a lottery.","I'm just a natural flirt, but I don't see it in a sexual way. A lot of the time I'm like an overexcited puppy.","If someone feels they have to live up to a certain image, then I can kind of understand that pressure because I'm considered to be one of those images, and I know how unreal they are.","I'm sure that love exists, even infinite, eternal love.","If you're part of a record company, you're a manufactured product. It doesn't mean that you're not talented.","When you work in TV, it's such a group effort, it's not about you.","Having had cancer, one important thing to know is you're still the same person at the end. You're stripped down to near zero. But most people come out the other end feeling more like themselves than ever before.","When I was younger, my grandma taught me how to cut patterns and sew.","Part of me is a sexual exhibitionist.","I walk into the studio and we're all so happy to see each other.","You know, songs often have a very coloured past. They might have something about them but it still doesn't work, so someone else adds a bit, and someone else adds a bit so perhaps one day I'll know its full history.","I get the lyrics of a tune and interpret them my way.","My gay audience has been with me from the beginning.","I do dance music, and I can be pretty camp myself from time to time.","I've had a lot of tragic hairdos and outfits.","Everyone knows how much Australia means to me. I try to get back here as much as I can, but normally it's for work, so I'm in and out and jetlagged and stressed.","I've been accustomed to being famous and having a certain level of attention for 14 years, but in the last few months, it's changed. It's like on the arcade game, I've gone up to the next level.","The Sun in London ran a front page declaring my bum a national treasure. I really did laugh at that. Its not like it can actually do anything, except wiggle.","I've fancied other women, but I haven't done anything about it.","I used to be able to do the Chinese splits, where you open your legs sideways.","I've always been a little shy about taking my clothes off, but I don't worry about it any more.","I just want to do everything. I don't want to sound soppy or too cliched, but that's the way it is.","I just can't help but see things differently.","I'm not sure that I'll be able to do everything that I did before.","The moment my doctor told me, I went silent. My mum and dad were with me, then we all went to pieces. I was saying, No, I've got my flight to Sydney in two hours. I'm getting on a plane.","I know there will be X amount of women being diagnosed. I love to say, You can get through it. You can.","Gay icons usually have some tragedy in their lives, but I've only had tragic haircuts and outfits.","People see me as Kylie the singer. It would be a dream for me to be taken seriously as an actress.","When I was eight, my pals and I went up to my bedroom, put on our party frocks and mimed to ABBA records using broom handles as microphones.","You can be very efficient with lyrics, and you can get the heart fluttering or soaring or make someone cry with a really amazing dance song.","I get sensationalism, I get gossip, I understand that. If I'm at the dentist, I'll flip through those magazines as well. But it's especially annoying when it's something that is too much.","The idea behind the Anti Tour was people asking me how I would top the 'Aphrodite' tour... I thought the best option was to go completely the other way. I always tried to be that way - sometimes it works and sometimes you fall flat on your face.","Funnily enough, when I was leaving school and they asked you what you were going to do, and I just liked acting, that's never what I would say. I would always say I would go into business, even though I didn't really know what was meant by that.","I am really not looking further than my next trip. I'm enjoying being in the moment.","I consider myself really lucky to be able to visit so many parts of the world, but after all of that, I love to come home. I appreciate my own space and the world I create for myself, my family and friends.","I have always had a separate walk-in wardrobe, so I have the luxury of a fairly sparse bedroom.","I am in love with my La Cornue custom-made stove - it's a dream to use and my favourite part of the kitchen.","I'm convinced there are a lot of couples who have got together while listening to my music. My songs are not exactly unsexy.","Let's just say that I am aware my style has meaning for some people.","I'd definitely love to do more acting. My heart cries out for it; it's such a deep longing.","When I started, there was something almost romantic about the notion of paparazzi. I mean, it wasn't. They were still chasing you down the road. But that guy had to put film in his camera and work out whether it was worth pressing the button to take the shot, otherwise he's got to stop and change the film. So it was like this age of innocence."],"Kym Whitley":["It feels like I'm in a swimming pool, and I am constantly trying to stay above water. Sometimes I feel like I'm slipping, and you try to come up for air, and that's how it is when looking for the next role.","'College Road Trip' is colorless. It's not a black film. It's not a white film.","So many people are busy working now, but we need to go back to the old days when grandma and the neighbors helped raise the children, and we were all the better for it.","I'm not cheap, I'm thrifty.","I've always had an entourage. Even when I was a little kid, I had a lot of little children following around me.","Sometimes you have to change the mold. If people keep following the same Hollywood mold, you're going to get the same thing. And as a Black actress, there's not a whole lot out there for us, unless we're creating it.","I didn't know that my son had allergies until he spit up eggs one day, and one day he had a little peanut butter and his face swelled up. I took him to get tested and found out that he is allergic to everything.","My parenting style is probably like that of my parents, because you do how you learn. My mother was very nurturing and loving, but very stern. She was a disciplinary. My dad was also very loving.","A woman is a woman. A woman has male problems, has job problems, and I think funny is funny.","I'm always fighting with profanity and Christian comedy. I'm telling you, it's always a fight. Because my father said to me, he said, 'Well, Kym, I feel like comics and people that use profanity, you have a lack of vocabulary, actually, a whole lot.'","The OWN network is all about inspiring and enlightening.","Of course I watch 'Life with La Toya' on OWN.","I believe that people just want to laugh and have a good time.","I am a different kind of celebrity; I don't have the big, giant house, the fancy cars, and all the designer stuff. I am just a girl from Cleveland.","I come from a long line of architects. I'm the only one who did not become an architect, but I've been around the drawing aspect and construction my whole life.","I think the arts are absolutely necessary for children to be creative and express themselves because every child is different.","We still have to create things for African American women. Just like Tyler Perry is doing it, we can't wait for things to happen; you have to go and make and create roles and go to people.","It's so much easier when you're a size two or three to just slip on anything. But a big girl, sometimes you've got to strap some stuff down!","My parents were funny. My brothers were funny. We just laughed and had a good time. Growing up, it breeds that. It breeds your funny. It breeds your creativity.","I love Cleveland, and I love going back home. That's where my family is. That's where my roots are.","When I first came to Los Angeles, I was a teacher in Compton. I know how in need schools are around the country.","I've always wanted to work with children, to help people, and to be funny.","After my episode of 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' ran, Larry David and JJ Abrams were like, 'I discovered her,' but I was like 'Hold up. Please. I'm from 'Next Friday.' Everybody knows me!'","I love female company. I love men, but women are different.","In the African American community, we are very 'hush, hush' about things in our life.","Cooking for my son is a challenge. I have to feed him right. He can't eat French fries and candy every day.","Back in the day, we ate fresh; our parents cooked. Now, we're starting to think things are fresh because they're in a can, they're in a box, or they're frozen. That's not fresh. It's difficult to get real fresh.","Carrying envy makes life more difficult.","It is a challenge trying not to give in to pleasing other people.","I want adopted people to know they were chosen.","It doesn't matter if a child comes to you or through you. That love is still the same. You are still a mother.","I saw Nichelle Nichols in 'Truck Turner,' and she was so good.","My cousin was Ron O'Neal, who was 'Superfly.' Films like 'Shaft' and 'Superfly' were the biggest things out there in the early '70s. It's hard to remember just how big they were - how much impact they had on the culture, the music, the fashions, the hair styles.","Voice work is the best - no need to dress up, no audience, no pressure, nobody's judging you.","I've always dreamed of becoming a mother. I thought I would get married and do it all the traditional way, but life kept going on, my career kept me busy - and I had not stopped to become a mommy.","I encourage people to get a village so that there will always be someone who's like family looking out for your child.","As an actress, our hours can be grueling, and like any mother that has a career or job, it is difficult. Balancing spending time with your child in the morning and after they come home from daycare/school before is the key.","I've always wanted to be a man for a day.","Sometimes, moms have to be creative to get their babies to eat healthy.","Shaker Heights, Ohio is a predominately white neighborhood. It was when I moved in, and it still is.","I worked with Marlon Wayans on the show 'They Wayans Brothers,' and we hit it off. One thing about Marlon, when he casts a movie or a TV show, he expects you to bring it. You've got to be ready to improv, because Marlon will say anything, and you've got to be ready to come back.","If you could draw a picture of the best high school in the world - where all the teachers are wonderful and all the classrooms are beautiful, it would be my high school.","I've thought my show would be a sitcom or a talk show. Never in a million years would I have thought my show would be docu-series/reality because you always think reality is something crazy.","You can talk about reality TV if you want to, but guess what - it was a big commercial for Kym Whitley."],"Kyp Malone":["I think that creative work, music in particular, is a conveyor of inner emotional life. I don't feel one way all the time, so I don't want my music to feel the same way all the time.","Honestly, most of the stuff I made for 'TV on the Radio,' I write in the studio.","When I was little and I was introduced to Led Zeppelin, I didn't know what a zeppelin was or who Zeppelin was or what the machine was. The real meaning is whatever feelings and memories you attach to the music.","As long as I'm blessed and/or cursed to be alive, it's hard to see a time when I won't be making music.","I don't feel a real need to specify the meaning of something. When I was little and I was introduced to Led Zeppelin, I didn't know what a zeppelin was or who Zeppelin was or what the machine was. The real meaning is whatever feelings and memories you attach to the music.","When I go to galleries in New York, I feel like I'm in school. I know that there's good contemporary conceptual art, but I have a really hard time caring about it. I'd rather look at images of people and things I can relate to. Then again, I didn't go to art school.","I just don't want to watch TV, and I know that life is short. I feel like I couldn't do all the things I wanted to do if I had several lifetimes to do them in.","Being my own boss and working inside an industry that's not really an industry, I need to keep busy and keep working. The only way to make money in music - unless you're managing someone - is to tour, and even that depends on where you are at.","I'm not really big on video games at all, I played a lot at the arcade as a kid. I didn't have a system growing up at my house.","I'm done with cool. I've been done with cool for years.","I like pop music. I also like the sound of a dying refrigerator. I can listen to that for an hour and a half if I'm in the mood.","I don't think that three minutes of music on a commercial record is going to bring paradise, but I feel like there is power in music and power in our words and power in what we put out into the world.","I'm not a regionalist. Both places have their pros and cons. And the cultural differences are slighter than they are made out to be. L.A. riots, N.Y. shops. Both are good for stress relief."],"Kyra Sedgwick":["We do spend time talking about it and we puzzle through it together. We ride the roller coasters together - the high highs and the low lows.","It's not always thankless. Let's face it - it's not always thankless. I've gotten a lot of really great recognition and I've worked with amazing people.","You know, I grew up with brothers so I'm used to being the only girl.","While it is challenging working with a kid, because they're so of the moment all the time. My acting style is to try to take something from my life that the character can relate to and that I can relate the character to.","Whether it be in a small movie or a big movie, I would always be attracted to this role.","Ultimately, you know, I'm a grown-up, I've been in this business a long time. I've got kids. I've got to do my stuff. But I also need to keep it there so I can bring it up again the next day at work or whatever.","Sometimes when you do a part, the wall between you and the characters can be very porous. You can sort of move in and out of your character's persona and being. And that just couldn't happen on this one because of working with him.","Some of the best roles are for women in these independent, smaller movies.","Shame is such an intense emotion. It just can drive you.","It's that I'm 39. I feel hot and sexy, actually... I feel it inside myself. I don't feel dried up and tired and no longer interested in sex is what I'm trying to say.","It's not that I don't see myself as hot and sexy. Don't get me wrong. No, it's not that.","It's easier in some ways being on the life raft and the other guy's in the boat and you can row alongside and be supportive. In some ways, that's an easier role.","I've always been able to let stuff go when I'm done with work.","I was very young when we got married and I don't know why it worked out like it did or how I was smart enough to know that this was the right guy, but somehow I got lucky.","I think that certainly my choices empower me.","I think it's important to do smaller films because I think that's where a lot of new things are happening.","I think it's important to do great work.","I think in this movie, every time I see his work, I'm blown away by it because he, to me, he really embodied the character so powerfully and so real, so truthfully to me.","I have too much respect for the characters I play to make them anything but as real as they can possibly be. I have a great deal of respect for all of them, otherwise I wouldn't do them. And I don't want to screw them by not portraying them honestly.","I feel my job as an actor is to explore all sides of humanity.","I don't know if you're married, but sometimes there are times where one is really together with their partner. And then there are times when you're both just in your own thing, but you're there together.","I do know that I have to work hard for every single thing that I get, really hard, and that's okay.","I do it because I want to exercise people's compassion and I do it because I really believe that for some reason what I do is important and meaningful.","I can't get hired in a studio movie. Everything is so uphill.","Hollywood movies are run on fear and they don't want to make bold choices. They, generally, speaking want to keep things status quo. That's not really interesting for me.","Hollywood is sexist and age-ist, and that covers all the bases, I guess.","He put a ring in the toe of a stocking. On Christmas Eve, we opened our stockings and it was there at the bottom of the toe. Then he got down on his knees and he was shaking.","But when you're in something together, it's very hard to be objective and you're very subjective.","Also everyone's hearts are in the right place when you do a small movie. You're not doing it for the money; you're not doing it for the possibility of an Oscar nomination. You are doing it because you love the material.","After 14 years, it better be a real marriage, you know? We do have a great time together. We are really lucky."],"Kyrie Irving":["One thing that somebody told me is that leadership is a lonely role - some people can do it, and some people can't.","I've been musically inclined since I picked up an instrument in the fourth grade. I just really appreciate music. I love to listen to it; I love to sing. I wouldn't consider myself, like, a natural singer. I just developed it over time, honestly, just listening. I'm a great listener to music.","My focus is basketball, and that's it.","The only thing I command is respect.","All I do is sit at home and watch Netflix.","I do feel like a Clevelander. Every time, when people ask me, I automatically say, 'My home is Cleveland.'","My eventual goal is to win a championship. And before I retire, I just want to win a championship. That's it.","Going in, you want to play a perfect season and play throughout the whole entire season, but injuries are a part of basketball.","When I'm playing the 1-guard, I'm kind of seeing everything that's going on. When I play the 2, I have a more broader understanding of what's going on and where the screens are being set in order for not only myself to get open, but for my teammates.","I can't even give my father a proper gift. Every single Father's Day means so much to me. I'm so close to him. He's my big brother, but also my father.","I've worked countless hours in the gym, so I feel like I'm already prepared for the game. So when I'm listening to music pregame, it's really just about personal enjoyment.","When it applies to the Olympics and making a decision, I have to claim Australia as my country.","When you're playing against a whole bunch of All-Stars, it's like a video game. There's so much talent on the floor at once.","I'm not really a big X's and O's guy, but if you want to go there, I'm more of a space-the-floor type of coach: Five out, zero in, and that's the way we play basketball, screen and roll here and there, pocket passes everywhere; it's what it's about.","Multiple Bentleys isn't making anyone 'financially set.'","I love the gym; I love basketball. I'm really passionate about it.","I'm going to give input when I need to. When it needs to be said.","Everybody in the NBA is good. And then you have the really good ones and the great ones.","I'm probably one of the most competitive people ever.","When I'm playing the 1-guard, teams do a great job of just loading up and preparing for my drives and preparing for my three-point shots.","Even during my injury, I had fun because I got to be a regular college kid.","You want to keep the defense guessing.","Directors tell me what to do, and I kind of just put my own twist to it, just to get inside my personality that everybody doesn't really get to see - my off-the-court interests and the way I act. It's just me.","I do have a chef, but I still go out. Sometimes I can still blend in, and sometimes I get a little bombarded. It's the best of both worlds.","I'm a big video game fan.","I went to my agent and told them, 'I want to be on another Disney show.'","'Grease' is an awesome movie. I wish they'd make a new one, more for our time. The graphics are terrible when you look back on it.","I want to be on the cover of 'GQ.' That's a personal goal.","I don't leave home without my Skullcandy Crushers. I don't leave home without my Bible, without my phone, and without my computer.","Guys like Josh Gordon need to stay in his sport and mind his own business.","Draft day is a hectic day, especially for draftees and, more or less, for management.","One game I'm always on is 'NBA Jam.' And 'Bejeweled,' games like that, and 'Temple Run.'"],"Kyrsten Sinema":["I think what endurance sports teach you is to stay dedicated, stay focused, and also to understand you're going to have ups and downs, but you need to keep running right through them.","I think there's this pressure to get rid of the fun that makes us human. It hasn't worked on me.","I'm very concerned about the tone of politics in recent years. We've seen a decline in civility and bipartisanship, and a rapid increase in hostility between those who have differing opinions. I think this has led to the alienation of the public in governance, which jeopardizes democratic participation.","I don't think Arizonans are interested in having the Mormon religion dictate public policy to them.","I'm an environmentalist; I recycle.","A huge dollar bill is the most accurate way to teach children the real motto of the United States: In the Almighty Dollar We Trust... Until the average American realizes that capitalism damages her livelihood while augmenting the livelihoods of the wealthy, the Almighty Dollar will continue to rule. It certainly is not ruling in our favor.","I lived for two years in an abandoned gas station with no running water and no electricity after my parents got divorced and my stepdad couldn't get a job. So I think a lot about families like mine who were middle class and struggled. So that experience really drives my philosophy.","I didn't really have an interest in politics when I first entered the workforce. What I wanted to do was help people who grew up like me. When I was a kid growing up in Tucson, my father lost his job and we lost everything - including our home. We lived in an abandoned gas station for two years until we were able to get back on our feet.","My family was actually homeless for several years when I was a kid. It's a bit unusual for a member of Congress.","I was not a Democrat; I was an independent. Here's the thing: You can't win that way. But I didn't know that.","My parents are very conservative. They taught me the value of hard work - don't depend on other people, do it yourself.","On most holidays, you'll find me in Mexico. Actually, on most holidays you won't find me. I'm at a beach, and it's wonderful.","I speak my mind. I'm not really afraid of things. I actually don't think that's that unusual.","I have great respect for the LDS church - their commitment to family and taking care of each other is exemplary. I just don't believe the tenets of the faith that they believe.","Bisexuals are gay people - we're all gay. Some people don't like that.","My number 1 priority is common sense, because we don't see a lot of that in the state capitol.","When I first started campaigning, I was really excited. Two-thirds of the way through, I thought, 'Why am I doing this?' Then I got really excited when I realized I was going to win.","I'm just really proud of the Democratic caucus. I look around in our meetings, and I think we really look like America.","I kind of grew up with a mix of two things. One was kind of this individual work ethic that my father and my stepfather and my mother all taught me, which was never depend on anyone else to do things for you, and work really hard on your own. At the same time, I benefited from the help of church and family and government my whole life.","I'm not a member of any faith community, and I think faith is a deeply personal issue that individuals should deal with in their private lives.","I was just born involved in politics. My family is conservative Mormon, and so I was born - although the Mormon faith is not inherently political, their faith requires some political stands, and those are ones that I happen to disagree with vehemently - so I was just political from a very early age.","Sometimes when troops are overseas working these incredibly long hours in a difficult situation, they're not always hearing how much they're appreciated.","As you know, I did not support the United States' engagement in Iraq and have long had concerns about Afghanistan... But I obviously have always been 100 percent supportive of our military.","While I am grateful for the friendships and relationships that I have with my Republican colleagues, it would be naive to pretend that those friendships will change the way that major policies are enacted in Arizona.","You should never take military intervention off the table. When you do so, you give an out to a rogue nation or rogue actors.","I spent nearly two decades as a social worker and an educator with kids. So, my whole life has been about helping middle-class families. So it's just kind of a hollow argument to say I'm not a family person.","I have great respect for Sandra Day O'Connor. She has broken so many barriers for women in the law, and was a master negotiator and pragmatist in her days on the Supreme Court.","The number one thing I will take with me is my experience as a social worker who saw what happened to families who couldn't find jobs, struggled to take care of their health and saw opportunity slipping away for their kids. I ran for Congress because politicians were fighting with each other instead of looking out for these families.","Arizona is in the midst of a fiscal crisis. We've cut school funding. And they pass a bill questioning Obama's citizenship? For real?","I remember when I was a young social worker, the first time I went to the state capital in Arizona, where I eventually served for seven years, I was so nervous to go and lobby my state legislators. Because I only had a master's degree at the time in social work.","Hardworking families can no longer afford to wait for a Congress that gridlocks on ideology. I look forward to working with my colleagues from both parties to get things done."]}
