{"V. E. Schwab":["Fencing is a game of living chess, a match where reflexes only work in combination with intent, and mind and body must work together at every moment.","I love being new places and hate getting there, and have been known to say on multiple occasions that I would give anything from a piece of my soul to a limb to a portion of my life savings to teleport. Especially when bad weather keeps me off planes.","I am a firm believer that a good plot makes for a fun enough read, but it's not what binds us. If we don't care about the characters, we won't care - not in a lasting way - about what's happening to them.","I'm pagan.","I like to play with tropes.","It's not what people do that matters, it's why they do it.","As for advice for aspiring authors, the best I can give is to be brave. It sounds like a simple enough thing, but it's not. Rejection is such an integral part of this journey, and it never goes away.","I still get rejections - frequently - and my goal isn't to never fail, to never be turned down, but simply to succeed more often than I don't. And in order to do that, I have to constantly put myself out there, to judgment, critique, and rejection.","I almost always start with setting! I have to know the world before I know how to populate it. I have a tendency to play with doors - between life and death, human and monster, mundane and magic - and with 'ADSOM,' I knew I wanted to play with the physical doors between worlds.","So many people think that if you're writing fantasy, it means you can just make everything up as you go. Want to add a dragon? Add a dragon! Want some magic? Throw it in. But the thing is, regardless of whether you're dealing with realism or fantasy, every world has rules. Make sure to establish a natural order.","I think a lot of writers are tempted to add complexity by over-complicating things, but always remember that most natural rules/laws are, at their core, simple. Start simple, and build from there, or you risk getting yourself and your readers tangled.","It's always hard, when introducing readers to a new world/set of rules, not to lay it all out manual-style in the opening chapters but make sure to put the action and the characters at the front. If people don't become invested in them and in the story, the world in which it's set will become a burden.","I'd grown up an athletic child, a competitive soccer player since age 4, with stints ranging from months to years in gymnastics, softball, volleyball.","I was fourteen, watching 'The Princess Bride' for the 254321th time, captivated by Wesley and Inigo dueling on the cliff-top. I had never held a sword in my life, but I phoned my mum and said, 'I want to learn to fence!'","Young people like to think they're invincible. They don't like to face any situation where they've gotten weaker instead of stronger."],"V. S. Naipaul":["Home is, I suppose just a child's idea. A house at night, and a lamp in the house. A place to feel safe.","One isn't born one's self. One is born with a mass of expectations, a mass of other people's ideas - and you have to work through it all.","There are two ways of talking. One is the easy way, where you talk lightly, and the other one is the considered way. The considered way is what I have put my name to.","I read many things. I read to fill in my knowledge of the world.","It was a good place for getting lost in, a city no one ever knew, a city explored from the neutral heart outward, until after many years, it defined itself into a jumble of clearings separated by stretches of the unknown, through which the narrowest of paths had been cut.","An autobiography can distort; facts can be realigned. But fiction never lies: it reveals the writer totally.","I know my father and my mother, but beyond that I cannot go. My ancestry is blurred.","Africans need to be kicked, that's the only thing they understand.","The world is always in movement.","To be converted you have to destroy your past, destroy your history. You have to stamp on it, you have to say 'my ancestral culture does not exist, it doesn't matter.'","To be a writer you have to be out in the world, you have to risk yourself in the world, you have to be immersed in the world, you have to go out looking for it. This becomes harder as you get older because there's less energy, the days are shorter for older people and it's not so easy to go out and immerse oneself in the world outside.","I have always moved by intuition alone. I have no system, literary or political. I have no guiding political idea.","I read a piece of writing and within a paragraph or two I know whether it is by a woman or not.","If you decide to move to another country and to live within its laws you don't express your disregard for the essence of the culture. It's a form of aggression.","Writers should provoke disagreement.","That element of surprise is what I look for when I am writing. It is my way of judging what I am doing - which is never an easy thing to do.","The world is what it is; men who are nothing, who allow themselves to become nothing, have no place in it.","A cat only has itself.","But everything of value about me is in my books.","The longer I live the more convinced I become that one of the greatest honors we can confer on other people is to see them as they are, to recognize not only that they exist, but that they exist in specific ways and have specific realities.","It is important not to trust people too much.","Some writers can only deal with childhood experience, because it's complete. For another kind of writer, life goes on, and he's able to keep processing that as well.","Argentine political life is like the life of an ant community or an African forest tribe: full of events, full of crisis and deaths, but life is always cyclical, and the year ends as it begins.","I came to London. It had become the center of my world and I had worked hard to come to it. And I was lost.","I am the kind of writer that people think other people are reading.","This is unusual for me. I have given readings and not lectures. I have told people who ask for lectures that I have no lecture to give. And that is true.","The reason is that they define how I have gone about my business. I have trusted to intuition. I did it at the beginning. I do it even now. I have no idea how things might turn out, where in my writing I might go next.","I have trusted to my intuition to find the subjects, and I have written intuitively. I have an idea when I start, I have a shape; but I will fully understand what I have written only after some years.","I will say I am the sum of my books.","Each book, intuitively sensed and, in the case of fiction, intuitively worked out, stands on what has gone before, and grows out of it. I feel that at any stage of my literary career it could have been said that the last book contained all the others.","The world outside existed in a kind of darkness; and we inquired about nothing.","As a child I knew almost nothing, nothing beyond what I had picked up in my grandmother's house. All children, I suppose, come into the world like that, not knowing who they are.","My life is short. I can't listen to banality.","If writers just sit and talk about oppression, they are not going to do much writing.","Nothing was made in Trinidad.","Great writing can be done in biography, history, art.","Judgment is contained in the act of trying to understand.","All the details of the life and the quirks and the friendships can be laid out for us, but the mystery of the writing will remain. No amount of documentation, however fascinating, can take us there.","One always writes comedy at the moment of deepest hysteria.","There are certain things that are too painful for people to even write about sometimes, and there are certain things that are too hard to read about again.","Whatever extra there is in me at any given moment isn't fully formed. I am hardly aware of it; it awaits the next book. It will - with luck - come to me during the actual writing, and it will take me by surprise.","The biography of a writer - or even the autobiography - will always have this incompleteness.","What was past was past. I suppose that was the general attitude.","In Trinidad, where as new arrivals we were a disadvantaged community, that excluding idea was a kind of protection; it enabled us - for the time being, and only for the time being - to live in our own way and according to our own rules, to live in our own fading India.","We made no inquiries about India or about the families people had left behind. When our ways of thinking had changed, and we wished to know, it was too late. I know nothing of the people on my father's side; I know only that some of them came from Nepal.","I'm the kind of writer that people think other people are reading.","Africa has no future.","My publisher, who was so good as a taster and editor, when she became a writer, lo and behold, it was all this feminine tosh.","In England I am not English, in India I am not Indian. I am chained to the 1,000 square miles that is Trinidad; but I will evade that fate yet.","If ever you wish to meet intellectual frauds in quantity, go to Paris.","I've never abandoned the novel.","I had no student friends to talk to about literature. My tutor was a really nice man, very charming - but he had no literary judgment.","I really wasn't equipped to be a writer when I left Oxford. But then I set out to learn. I've always had the highest regard for the craft. I've always felt it was work.","It's very attractive to people to be a victim. Instead of having to think out the whole situation, about history and your group and what you are doing... if you begin from the point of view of being a victim, you've got it half-made. I mean intellectually.","Trinidad may seem complex, but to anyone who knows it, it is a simple, colonial, philistine society.","If a writer doesn't generate hostility, he is dead.","I don't feel I can speak with authority for many other people.","The ancillary aspect of every British city now is the council estate.","In England people are very proud of being very stupid.","I profoundly feel that people are letting you down all the time.","I always knew who I was and where I had come from. I was not looking for a home in other people's lands.","I went to India and met some people who had been involved in this guerrilla business, middle-class people who were rather vain and foolish. There was no revolutionary grandeur to it. Nothing.","Making a book is such a big enterprise.","I still think it's really quite wonderful when I read a sentence of mine and it has that quality of lastingness.","Many writers tend to write summing-up books at the end of their lives.","Whenever I have had to write fiction, I've always had to invent a character who roughly has my background.","I grew up in a small place and left it when I was quite young and entered the bigger world.","One must always try to see the truth of a situation - it makes things universal.","The first 50 years of the cinema were absolutely great years. Original minds were at work establishing the ways to tell a story. And what is happening now is a copying, a pastiche-ing of what was done by great men.","You need someone to see what you've done, to read it and to understand it and to appreciate what's gone into it.","If you write a novel alone you sit and you weave a little narrative. And it's O.K., but it's of no account.","I became very interested in the Islamic question, and thought I would try to understand it from the roots, ask very simple questions and somehow make a narrative of that discovery.","A civilization which has taken over the world cannot be said to be dying.","All the things that were read to me by my father were stories about things becoming all right.","My grief is that the publishing world, the book writing world is an extraordinary shoddy, dirty, dingy world.","I have a very small public.","I'm thought to be a tough writer, but I'm really a softie.","I could meet dreadful people and end up seeing the world through their eyes, seeing their frailties, their needs.","I'm very content.","I've been a free man.","Writing has to support itself.","Africa is not a fun place, you know. A fun place is somewhere that lifts the spirits, that cossets the senses. I don't think that can be said of the Africa I traveled in.","In a way my reputation has become that of the curmudgeon.","When I learnt to write I became my own master, I became very strong, and that strength is with me to this very day.","The writer is all alone.","If a man begins writing at thirty, by the time he is fifty or sixty, the bulk of his work has been done. By the time he is eighty, he's got nothing more, you know?","How can you be an atheist and have an ideology to go with it? To be an atheist is to be free of some areas of belief. I don't see how that can become an ideology.","One is made by all the things around one. There are many things that have made one. For a writer to go around looking for things that have made him is asking for trouble. It's like giving a character to yourself. Can't do it. Can't do it. These things are just there. Is that enough?","If you want to write serious books, you must be ready to break the forms, break the forms.","At school I had only admirers; I had no friends.","What I felt was, if you spend your life just writing fiction, you are going to falsify your material. And the fictional form was going to force you to do things with the material, to dramatize it in a certain way. I thought nonfiction gave one a chance to explore the world, the other world, the world that one didn't know fully."],"V. S. Pritchett":["The secret of happiness is to find a congenial monotony.","Life - how curious is that habit that makes us think it is not here, but elsewhere.","Well, youth is the period of assumed personalities and disguises. It is the time of the sincerely insincere.","In our family, as far as we are concerned, we were born and what happened before that is myth.","The Canadian spirit is cautious, observant and critical where the American is assertive.","How extraordinary it is that one feels most guilt about the sins one is unable to commit."],"Vachel Lindsay":["You can't crush ideas by suppressing them. You can only crush them by ignoring them.","I am unjust, but I can strive for justice. My life's unkind, but I can vote for kindness. I, the unloving, say life should be lovely. I, that am blind, cry out against my blindness.","To live in mankind is far more than to live in a name."],"Vaclav Havel":["Hope is not the conviction that something will turn out well but the certainty that something makes sense, regardless of how it turns out.","Isn't it the moment of most profound doubt that gives birth to new certainties? Perhaps hopelessness is the very soil that nourishes human hope; perhaps one could never find sense in life without first experiencing its absurdity.","Hope is a state of mind, not of the world. Hope, in this deep and powerful sense, is not the same as joy that things are going well, or willingness to invest in enterprises that are obviously heading for success, but rather an ability to work for something because it is good.","Sometimes I wonder if suicides aren't in fact sad guardians of the meaning of life.","Work for something because it is good, not just because it stands a chance to succeed.","Without free, self-respecting, and autonomous citizens there can be no free and independent nations. Without internal peace, that is, peace among citizens and between the citizens and the state, there can be no guarantee of external peace.","The exercise of power is determined by thousands of interactions between the world of the powerful and that of the powerless, all the more so because these worlds are never divided by a sharp line: everyone has a small part of himself in both.","The tragedy of modern man is not that he knows less and less about the meaning of his own life, but that it bothers him less and less.","Hope is definitely not the same thing as optimism. It is not the conviction that something will turn out well, but the certainty that something makes sense, regardless of how it turns out.","When a truth is not given complete freedom, freedom is not complete.","As soon as man began considering himself the source of the highest meaning in the world and the measure of everything, the world began to lose its human dimension, and man began to lose control of it.","Lying can never save us from another lie.","Hope is a feeling that life and work have meaning. You either have it or you don't, regardless of the state of the world that surrounds you.","Just as the constant increase of entropy is the basic law of the universe, so it is the basic law of life to be ever more highly structured and to struggle against entropy.","Modern man must descend the spiral of his own absurdity to the lowest point; only then can he look beyond it. It is obviously impossible to get around it, jump over it, or simply avoid it.","Theater is there to search for questions. It doesn't give you instructions.","I really do inhabit a system in which words are capable of shaking the entire structure of government, where words can prove mightier than ten military divisions.","If we are to change our world view, images have to change. The artist now has a very important job to do. He's not a little peripheral figure entertaining rich people, he's really needed.","None of us know all the potentialities that slumber in the spirit of the population, or all the ways in which that population can surprise us when there is the right interplay of events.","There are times when we must sink to the bottom of our misery to understand truth, just as we must descend to the bottom of a well to see the stars in broad daylight.","But if I were to say who influenced me most, then I'd say Franz Kafka. And his works were always anchored in the Central European region.","The deeper the experience of an absence of meaning - in other words, of absurdity - the more energetically meaning is sought.","Even a purely moral act that has no hope of any immediate and visible political effect can gradually and indirectly, over time, gain in political significance.","Anyone who takes himself too seriously always runs the risk of looking ridiculous; anyone who can consistently laugh at himself does not.","Drama assumes an order. If only so that it might have - by disrupting that order - a way of surprising.","There's always something suspect about an intellectual on the winning side.","The attempt to devote oneself to literature alone is a most deceptive thing, and often, paradoxically, it is literature that suffers for it.","The salvation of this human world lies nowhere else than in the human heart, in the human power to reflect, in human meekness and human responsibility.","I think theatre should always be somewhat suspect.","I think it's important for one to take a certain distance from oneself.","In my opinion, theater shouldn't give advice to citizens.","It lies in human nature that where you experience your first laughs, you also remember the age kindly.","What's certain is that a totalitarian enclave like Cuba's can't continue to exist, so change will definitely come there, eventually."],"Vaclav Klaus":["To pursue a so-called Third Way is foolish. We had our experience with this in the 1960s when we looked for a socialism with a human face. It did not work, and we must be explicit that we are not aiming for a more efficient version of a system that has failed.","People like me who were engaging in brinkmanship with the party economic bosses and the open dissidents who were being arrested were pursuing a common goal in different ways.","Those of us who lived under communism for most of our lives were looking toward the Western world because of its values, emphasis on democracy, individual liberties and freedom, and economic prosperity.","I'm absolutely convinced that the very small global warming we are experiencing is the result of natural causes. It's a cyclical phenomenon in the history of the Earth. The role of man is very small, almost negligible.","By the time I returned to Czechoslovakia, I had an understanding of the principles of the market.","I also helped write the five-page statement of principles that Civic Forum issued in late November. That was the first public expression of what the new government wanted to do.","I never intended to be a politician or office-seeker.","I was paid to read Western economic texts. In a way, the regime paid for their own undermining.","It is what makes the reform process an art, not just a science. You have to develop a strategy that tells you what reform measures you should follow and in what sequence.","Privatization of the state-owned economy is not yet on the agenda. We cannot do it immediately; my colleagues would not agree to it. But we must put all forms of ownership on an equal footing immediately and let different types of ownership compete with the state firms.","That means following a very restrictive fiscal and monetary policy which will squeeze the monopolies and cut their subsidies. On the micro level we will allow other economic agents, both domestic and foreign, to compete with them.","The events in the square, of course, made a deep impression on me and many other parents.","We must have the time to create strict rules so that property is not sold by Communist managers for a low price. They often get payments under the table to sell to the first bidder. This does not build public support for a market economy.","We served on the editorial board of a literary monthly called Face in 1968 and 1969. He was a young writer, and I was also interested in broad cultural issues. We agreed on all major issues and became friends.","We will also allow state companies to sell shares to their workers and will pass a law allowing citizens to start companies of their own with no limits on the number of employees or on the firm's output.","What we want is to establish the rules of a market economy - not to plan its outcome.","Then in 1969, I spent the spring term at Cornell University in New York. The invasion of August 1968 had already happened, but the hardline regime took several months to crack down on dissidents.","To talk about planning an economic system is to talk in old terms, and I find myself sometimes having to teach Westers about what the market really means.","Nevertheless, there is another threat on the horizon. I see this threat in environmentalism which is becoming a new dominant ideology, if not a religion. Its main weapon is raising the alarm and predicting the human life endangering climate change based on man-made global warming.","I live in Europe and care about democracy and sovereignty of nation states there.","It is obvious that the monetary union among 17 very different European countries does not work. As an economist, I know that the Eurozone is not an optimum currency area, as defined in economic theory.","The attempts to command the climate and decide about the temperature on our planet are wrong and arrogant. I wrote a book about it which was published in English under the title 'Blue Planet in Green Shackles.'","I do not consider the Lisbon Treaty to be a good thing for Europe, for the freedom of Europe, or for the Czech Republic."],"Vaclav Smil":["Exceptional circumstances can accelerate the gradual process of energy transitions: France's decision to develop nuclear energy on a grand scale is perhaps the best example of how that can be done by government fiat. In contrast, America's accelerated shift from coal has been driven by an inevitable embrace of cheaper natural gas.","I just don't stand for any nonsense.","Killing animals and eating meat have been significant components of human evolution that had a synergistic relationship with other key attributes that have made us human, with larger brains, smaller guts, bipedalism, and language.","Meat is undoubtedly an environmentally expensive food.","Some countries that grow lots of pork, like Denmark and the Netherlands, are either eliminating antibiotics or reducing them. We have to do that. Otherwise we'll create such antibiotic resistance, it will be just terrible.","You cannot increase the efficiency of photosynthesis. We improve the performance of farms by irrigating them and fertilizing them to provide all these nutrients. But we cannot keep on doubling the yield every two years. Moore's law doesn't apply to plants.","We're a society that demands electricity 24/7. This is very difficult with sun and wind.","Meat eaters don't like me because I call for moderation, and vegetarians don't like me because I say there's nothing wrong with eating meat. It's part of our evolutionary heritage! Meat has helped to make us what we are. Meat helps to make our big brains.","The history of energy use is a sequence of transitions to sources that are cheaper, cleaner, and more flexible.","Economic and technical imperatives - not any preconceived directives - will keep propelling the process of energy transition.","Renewable energy is very significant.","This is the question I'm asking: Do Americans live twice as long because they consume twice as much energy as Europeans? Are you people twice as smart as the average Frenchman? Do you enjoy life twice as much as the average Danish guy? What have we gotten for consuming twice as much energy as Europe? What have we gotten in return?","When you talk in terms of electricity, renewable is very important. Hydro in Manitoba. Hydro in Sweden. Wind in Denmark. Of course, those are very important.","I live in a province where we have the cheapest electricity in North America - indeed, in the Western world - but all of it is perfectly renewable because we have beautiful Manitoba Hydro. Every few tens of kilometers, we can put a river dam. Bingo. One gigawatt here. One gigawatt here.","In every society, manufacturing builds the lower middle class. If you give up manufacturing, you end up with haves and have-nots, and you get social polarization. The whole lower middle class sinks.","Most innovation is not done by research institutes and national laboratories. It comes from manufacturing - from companies that want to extend their product reach, improve their costs, increase their returns. What's very important is in-house research.","Innovation usually arises from somebody taking a product already in production and making it better: better glass, better aluminum, a better chip. Innovation always starts with a product.","The great hope for a quick and sweeping transition to renewable energy is wishful thinking.","Mass adoption of renewable energies would thus necessitate a fundamental reshaping of modern energy infrastructures.","I appreciate and love blue-green algae.","I really don't think I have anything special to say.","Your past always leads to who you are.","I wouldn't put a big trust in what people in Silicon Valley say. They may be good at manipulating ones and zeroes and writing software, but beyond that, their contribution to human progress has been pretty dismal. I'm not impressed.","I am probably one of the last people on the planet without a cell phone.","I'm old fashioned. I'm not one of these young guys who think they are so smart that they can prescribe what humanity ought to do. Humanity never learns any lessons. Prescriptions don't matter. We already know exactly what to do. We just don't do it.","There is no reason we can't design a car to last for 35 years instead of six or seven.","Behind every morsel of bread, fruits, or meat is a large amount of transformed fossil fuels.","If everyone wants to eat like people in Bangladesh, then we would have food coming out of everybody's ears.","Evolution has made us omnivores, and substantial quantities of meat can be produced by feeding plant matter whose production does not directly compete with growing food crops: crop residues, food processing waste, low-quality grain, and controlled grazing by ruminants.","All I want is to be left alone to write my books.","Most of the energy in North America is just consuming - Wal-Mart, shopping centres, government offices - or personal consumption: houses, cars, flying to Hawaii, gambling in Las Vegas. We could live affluent lifestyles with half as much energy.","Without any physical, chemical, and biological fundamentals, and with equally poor understanding of basic economic forces, it is no wonder that people will believe anything.","I studied what the Germans call the Naturwissenschaften, the natural sciences. Everything from biology to geology. How the clouds are formed, how the animals live, and what makes the rocks. So I know about nature. Period.","Harvesting the biosphere is still the most fundamental human activity. Without that, everybody's dead, really. We could do quite well without microchips, or the business site of 'Atlantic Monthly,' the gated communities, Guccis, and high-growth GDP. But we cannot do without harvesting the crops and cutting down the wood.","No human civilization could ever sever our dependence on photosynthesis.","I'm the product of the classical, old-fashioned European education that is broad-based. You want to get your degree in the world, you have to study all sorts of things.","Our increasingly electrified, electronic, and data-driven society places steadily rising demand on reliable baseload power - that is, on electricity available 24/7/365. Servers never sleep, nor does air conditioning during hot nights, and in Asia's megacities, subways and electric trains take only brief naps between midnight and 5 A.M.","America tends to assume Silicon Valley-style innovators can drive quick and transformative changes, but even Silicon Valley's would-be masters of the universe have discovered that energy transitions are subject to time spans and technical constraints that defy their reach.","Canadians are hardly assertive or demanding. We don't expect U.S. presidents to bow down to our prime ministers when they visit us in Ottawa, nor are we looking for the occasional kickback on an F-16 deal.","The problems that ail the U.S. economy and American society are one and the same: Both consume too much and refuse to make badly needed changes. This is true above all in the realm of energy.","Energy use is merely a means to many rewarding ends: economic security, education, health.","U.S. industries from steel-making to plastics synthesis are among the world's most energy-efficient; American agriculture is highly productive, as are America's railroads. But for decades, Americans themselves have been living beyond their means, wasting energy in their houses and cars and amassing energy-intensive throwaway products on credit.","There is no doubt that human evolution has been linked to meat in many fundamental ways. Our digestive tract is not one of obligatory herbivores; our enzymes evolved to digest meat, whose consumption aided higher encephalization and better physical growth.","Meat is undoubtedly an environmentally expensive food. Large animals have inherently low efficiency of converting feed to muscle, and only modern broilers can be produced with less than two units of feed per unit of meat.","Meat consumption is a part of our evolutionary heritage; meat production has been a major component of modern food systems. Carnivory should remain, within limits, an important component of a civilization that finally must learn how to maintain the integrity of its only biosphere.","Most scientific or engineering discoveries would never become successful products without contributions from other scientists or engineers. Every major invention is the child of far-flung parents who may never meet.","We insist on celebrating lone heroic path-finders, but even the most admired and the most successful inventors are part of a more remarkable supply chain of innovators who are largely ignored for the simpler mythology of one man or one eureka moment.","A brilliant mind having a eureka moment could not create an Intel microprocessor containing a billion transistors any more than one person could dream up a Boeing 787 from scratch.","Collaboration and augmentation are the foundational principles of innovation.","People shouldn't be living in certain places - on earthquake faults or on flood plains. But they do, and there are consequences."],"Vagit Alekperov":["I am also one of those persons who were transformed, who grew out of the Soviet system and transformed myself into the new Russia.","Gas consumption is growing everywhere.","In the Soviet Union I was the head of all oil production. And you know in the Soviet Union, you didn't get that job unless you were really worth it.","I am a normal guy.","Politics are close to me, but there are different ways of participating in politics.","I can't afford to be indifferent to politics, but I don't have personal ambitions.","I'm not an actor who appears on the stage and gives people advice on how to live or what to do and entertains them. It is not my specialty.","It is impossible to divide the interest of a country and a company that works on its soil."],"Val Guest":["Oh, yes, we were on location with Another Man's Poison, which I wrote for Bette Davis.","And he said that he wrote the Bond character based on the character of David Niven. That's how he saw Bond.","And then she finally said yes. And we have been married, I want you to know, for 51 years.","At those times I got into... I suppose you call it a rut. I used to do comedy, comedy, comedy and I suddenly thought I ought to break away from this somehow.","I don't know how we had about eighteen international stars in it, all playing James Bond.","I had a terrible job letting me do anything that wasn't comedy.","I used to write bits and pieces of comedy material for various comics that were at the Windmill... as well as my film job, I was under contract, I was allowed to do that and everything.","I wrote Murder at the Windmill. And it was accepted and we made it and it was the first film I made with Danny Angel, well the only film I actually made... I made a lot of it at the Windmill itself.","No, we didn't shoot... in the ones that I did there were hardly any sex... there were suggestions of sex scenes but we never actually shot a sex scene as such.","Now, I'll tell you something that might interest you. Casino Royale was the first Bond book that Ian Fleming ever wrote. And he couldn't get anybody to touch it, to publish it - he couldn't do anything about it at all. Nobody wanted to know.","We worked solidly for a long time together. George Marriott Edgar and myself.","Well, The Day the Earth Caught Fire was a story... I don't if anybody knows what it is but it was about... in the early days of testing nuclear bombs, that Russia and America happened to test a nuclear bomb at the same moment at different ends of the earth.","Well, yes, as I was a rather bad actor then and I wasn't making enough money, I thought, to make enough money to not make money as an actor, I'd better do some writing.","Yes, The Persuaders, that was great fun because one of my favourite actors is Roger Moore."],"Val Kilmer":["Without deadlines and restrictions I just tend to become preoccupied with other things.","Postman is a media analyst and his theory is that television doesn't influence our culture, but that it is our culture and the presidency and anything that relies on television.","Unless a Western's made money - doesn't matter who made the money, doesn't matter what the subject is - if the last one didn't make any money, you can't make another one for a four-year period. Westerns more than any genre.","Hollywood's like a warehouse. It's just a place that you go. What's interesting in the warehouse has to do with the creative people.","If you think that by threatening me you can get me to do what you want... well, that's where you're right. But - and I am only saying this because I care - there's a lot of decaffeinated brands on the market that are just as tasty as the real thing.","Mark Twain created a new type of literature and not a lot of people can say that. Not a lot of people can say they're absolutely original and completely self-made.","We take what's shown on television as the truth, and it isn't. News isn't even the truth on television. If you look up the definition of what news is, it isn't that what we're watching on the new - it's entertainment.","I don't watch television, but I saw 'The Office' by accident. I thought it was so sophisticated, the Victorian love story, and so bold. We'd do anything, all of us, to not work in that environment, and then I'm sitting there watching hours of it.","It's fun to look at people that are so good at acting that aren't actors, like David Bowie creating a mystique about rock n' roll. I've listened to 'Ziggy Stardust' as much as any rock n' roll fan - I don't really know what it's about, but it sure is fun to think about David Bowie as this mad creation.","Most films made about the future acquiesce toward death, and I don't want to be told how to define my future.","It's the first time that I've ever had an art show based on a film, but it's a photography collage.","My children have absolutely no interest in my fame. They're very sophisticated, and they have a spiritual perspective on material things because we go to church.","One out of 100 citizens of the U.S. is going to prison, and it's not that the system is making criminals, it's that it's making criminals better criminals. We're breeding them like rats and it has to change.","The Secret Service is a strange group. They don't really have a leader. It's not set up like a military. Each one is supposed to be able to act like a leader when something comes up.","My perception is that I've never done anything but work really hard.","Warner Bros offered me the next Batman, and the only reason that I didn't do it was because of The Saint.","I'm very wary of news on television.","If you look up the definition of news in the dictionary, it isn't what you watch on TV.","News is something that happens that matters to you, which is not most of what we watch on television.","Again, in Wag the Dog, war has to be declared by an act of congress. But if you go to war, you don't have to declare war. You're just at war and we did that, which is not legal.","Jim Thompson understood something about the serial killer before the psychology caught up to it, which is that they are detached to it and they do want to get caught.","I respect people who can do both careers, like Will Smith and a couple of other people who have done it, but I just don't know when they sleep.","I sang the songs in 'The Doors'.","Well I sure had been looking for a comedy for years without any success.","Partly because the town is just finicky, there are strange Catch 22 clauses in the consciousness of this community and one of them was that you, I found out, you can't do a comedy unless you've just done a comedy.","The first play I saw was a Samuel Beckett play which was great.","A lot of old guys in movies are like cowboys - they talk like cowboys and they dress like cowboys.","That's the joy of art - it should be dangerous and challenging but it's just art - it's safe.","Acting is very immediate.","I have two children and they're young yet but all of the children that I know really inspire me.","Mark Twain is as big as America. He really is.","Why do women get paid less money? It doesn't make any sense.","Mark Twain had a way of telling stories that shifts your consciousness away from labels.","There are a thousand ways to play any role.","You can ask anyone who knows me, I've never said a racist or prejudiced thing in my life.","I'm going to put a museum on my ranch and people keep saying, 'That's a huge idea.' Yeah, it's big, but not bigger than the average big movie. A hundred million dollars in the art world is a substantial amount of cash to do anything. That's maybe a big gallery's total sales for a given year.","I don't think of my life as a cliche, but I'm a cliche eccentric. Complete with a strange name - I mean, who's named Val? How many Vals do you know? I mean, really?","I think death is just a transition to another state of consciousness.","Being creative and making money in the theater is very challenging.","You just don't understand humility until you have children and get divorced.","Daryl Hannah likes to goof around with fashion, but she does have pretty impeccable taste.","The good reviews that people have told me about through the years haven't really helped me do my job. So it's kind of like, if your hair turns out right you want to go out, you don't just want to stay in and look in the mirror. That's kind of what reading a review is like to me; it's like reveling in something that's just one night.","With legitimate journalists I've always had a great time - I've never gone out of my way to court the press. That's probably cost me some money, but I've always had the respect of my peers.","I love that Bob Dylan asked me to be in the first movie he wrote.","There was no one around called 'Val' when I was young, so I wanted to be John or Bill. Now I like it.","Life is precious, and when someone dies it's an opportunity to realise how precious it is. My brother drowned when I was 17. He was 15. I think I grew from that. My father didn't. It really crushed him.","Youth is seen as everything. You don't know anything when you're young. It's great being older, just having a more balanced perspective. I wake up and realise that what seemed to be important last year no longer is. I'm increasingly grateful for every day.","It is a weird thing that actors have people applaud when they're done working. I still find that entertaining.","I just don't think I've ever been comfortable at public functions and selling myself as an entity.","There was such a relationship between the buffalo and the American Indian - the Indians would eat them, live inside their pelts, use every part of the body. There was almost no separation between the people and the animals.","When you're young, you're always concerned about how you're being seen and how you're being criticized.","I can safely say that no one who has ever won an Oscar didn't want to win an Oscar.","I never had a business plan. I did, actually - I'm lying. My business plan was to get lucky, and I did; that was great. And then my second business plan was to get lucky again, and there, I faltered.","Hollywood is wonderful, but it does eat its young.","If you're in a hit movie, it's good to be in another hit movie straight away.","I think part of my reputation has to do with the difficult roles I've played. Actors do tend to get identified with their characters.","I'm a character actor, but I look like a leading man.","It's the persona that makes you a leading actor. A leading actor has something extra that's fun to watch. But it isn't usually about acting.","It's a really weird thing, modern divorce. I found out I was getting divorced on television. That was kind of weird.","There's nothing good about divorce.","My father was raised in the mountains of New Mexico, and he picked cotton for a dollar a day. He was working for the family from the time he was 7.","There are lots of actors who are awful people, but nobody talks about them being awful because they've made billions.","What I do for a living is listen.","Peter Sellers was just a brilliant actor, and also comedic.","I am not an American; I am the American.","I've never been that comfortable talking about myself or about acting.","I live on a ranch that's larger than Manhattan. That's a weird circumstance.","I never cultivated a personality. Almost everyone who is really famous has cultivated a personality.","Warren Beatty once told me that if someone's really stuck on you, find them their next boyfriend. But I could never do that.","It's fun to look at people that are so good at acting that aren't actors, like David Bowie creating a mystique about rock n' roll.","A wonderful but kind of a terrible truth about acting is that you actually get to a point where you become content with an impossible task: it is really impossible to properly prepare. You kind of have to start over every time.","I would probably do anything with David Mamet. He's so great. I just love his writing.","News isn't even the truth on television.","I've been very fortunate and met the guys that have become, basically, philosophers and have a kind of sensibility about life that's very precious."],"Val McDermid":["I don't think many of us launched ourselves into the world of writing books fully formed.","One of the reasons we all still read Jane Austen is because her books are about universal things which still matter today - love, money, family. They haven't gone out of fashion, so it's not throwing the baby out with the bathwater to rework her in a contemporary style.","I think Jane Austen builds suspense well in a couple of places, but she squanders it, and she gets to the endgame too quickly. So I will be working on those things.","I am the despair of my accountant; I am the plastic bags of receipts.","It was a bit unimaginable when I began that I'd ever get to 25 books. But it was also unimaginable how much crime-writing would have changed.","We weren't dirt poor, but there was no spare money kicking around. While it was very much understood that the way to a better life was through education, books were a luxury we couldn't afford. But when I was six, we actually moved opposite the central library, and that became my home from home.","I've never wanted to live in a ghetto or write in a ghetto. I want to write about a world that reflects the one most people live in. Gay people are just one aspect of that.","I came from a working-class family, but I was supported by a grant system and had my fees paid, so I came out of Oxford with a debt of something like £200.","I said to Ruth Rendell, 'When you've written as many books as you have, it's easier.' She said, 'No dear, it gets harder'.","On one hand, you've got 'decent' men, and on the other you've got neanderthal misogynist bawbags - and the middle ground is what's disappearing.","I was thinking things had changed: that the next generation of men weren't as institutionally misogynist as the previous were. And then, suddenly, the Internet came along and gave them a platform to voice their feelings anonymously. And boy, did the bile come out.","There is still a funny notion that women should not write violent fiction.","The condition of rage is one in which I find myself starting my day - once I see the news headlines.","I spent a lot of time at my grandparents in the school holidays, and the only books in the house were a copy of the Bible and Agatha Christie's 'Murder at the Vicarage.' I developed a taste for murder mysteries and then later discovered libraries, second-hand bookshops, and jumble sales.","I don't think of myself as Scottish or lesbian when I sit down and write. I am glad I have broken out of that limited audience.","I did want to be Joni Mitchell for quite a long time.","I'd like to be more spontaneous.","I have a vernacular house on the seaside in Northumberland and an Edwardian semi in south Manchester. They're both exactly as big as they need to be. I can't be doing with an ostentatious, big house - you can only be in one room at a time.","Growing up in Fife, you were aware that there were these creatures called lesbians, but it was in the realms of complete freakishness. And I didn't feel like a freak.","The thing is that quite a few of my books have ended up as they are because of conversations I've had over the years with forensic scientists.","I won't be attempting to write Jane Austen-style prose - that would be suicidal. But I will attempt to bring the highest level of my own prose, and to make it sparkle.","The contemporary crime novel is, at its best, a novel of character. That's where the suspense comes from.","I think that crime is a good vehicle for looking at society in general because the nature of the crime novel means that you draw on a wide group of social possibilities.","It seems to me that one of the things that happened with a lot of literary fiction in the 1980s and 1990s was that it became very concerned with the academy and less with how people live their lives. We got to a point where the crime novel stepped into the breach. It was also a time when the crime novel stopped being so metropolitan.","We all present versions of ourselves. The person you are at work is not the same person you are at home. The face we present in our most intimate relationships is not the face we present to the world.","I was always writing the books that I wanted to write, books that demanded to be written at the time. But, like most writers, you start off feeling your way.","Back in the day, when I started, you were still allowed to make mistakes. You got to make your mistakes in public, in a way. I think the world was a more forgiving place when I started my career, in the sense that we got time and space to develop as a writer.","If you don't make the best-seller list, if you don't get shortlisted for any prizes, it's goodbye.","Walking by water frees your creativity. I don't know how it works - there's something about it that's liberating.","Sometimes fear is used as a way to control.","Why do the police need to know where I am? In the hands of a benevolent government, they could be looking after your interests, but what if the next government isn't so benevolent?","A lot of reality TV is repellent, but that doesn't diminish the qualities of some of the people who take part. There are decent people in there who have no alternatives."],"Valentina Matviyenko":["I do not believe in populism. I am not a supporter of radical decisions. Practice has shown that usually these are harmful.","Everyone in my country understands that Russia cannot do without Europe and that, vice versa, Europe cannot do without Russia. We depend on cooperation.","Of course the United States and Russia have different interests. Nevertheless, both are strategic partners.","St. Petersburg is a gem of world culture and Russia's most European city.","The mentality of the Russian demands a lord, a czar, a president."],"Valentina Tereshkova":["Hey sky, take off your hat, I'm on my way!","Once you've been in space, you appreciate how small and fragile the Earth is.","A bird cannot fly with one wing only. Human space flight cannot develop any further without the active participation of women.","One cannot deny the great role women have played in the world community. My flight was yet another impetus to continue this female contribution.","I am deeply grieved by the loss of the crew of Columbia. I express my sincere condolences to the families and friends of the astronauts. I believe that their names will remain as the bright sparkling stars in the universe and will light the way for those who will follow them on the difficult roads of space exploration.","We didn't have rest days or weekends because we had to get ready as fast as possible, so we could beat the Americans, who were also racing to send a woman into space.","There was a lake beneath me, but the big, heavy parachute which had to be opened two miles above the ground couldn't be steered. My first thought was, 'Lord, they send just one woman into space, and she has to end up in the water.'","The ideals of the party were close to me, and I have tried to adhere to those principles all my life. In essence, they are the same as in the Ten Commandments in the Bible. I will never change my convictions.","They forbade me from flying, despite all my protests and arguments. After being once in space, I was desperately keen to go back there. But it didn't happen.","On Earth, men and women are taking the same risks. Why shouldn't we be taking the same risks in space?","It doesn't matter what country or what political system you are from. Space brings you together.","You don't think about the danger. The spaceship becomes your home.","If women can be railroad workers in Russia, why can't they fly in space?","I am very resourceful, as any woman would be.","Anyone who has spent any time in space will love it for the rest of their lives. I achieved my childhood dream of the sky.","I would not say that female cosmonauts are not welcomed in the Russian space program. I must say, however, that all spaceflight hardware, including spacesuits and spacecraft comfort assuring systems, were designed mostly by men and for men.","After being once in space, I was keen to go back there. But it didn't happen.","Of course, it's a dream to go to Mars. I want to find out whether there was life there or not. And if there was, then why did it die out? What sort of catastrophe happened?","It was very difficult to control the descent. At a height of seven kilometres, I catapulted out of my capsule and parachuted down to Earth. I was very familiar with parachutes because I was a sky diver before.","I am convinced that the modular structure of the Mir will be the main trend in manned orbital stations development in the next century.","To tell her that I joined the parachute club was too hard for me. I didn't want to trouble her; besides, I was not completely sure about the success of my new adventure.","The missing toothbrush was nothing compared with the fact that the spacecraft was orientated to ascend, not descend. I would have gone up and up instead of going back down to the ground.","I love Star City - it is my home.","More women should actively participate in space flight. There are many well educated women working in the space industry; they are very good candidates.","I felt fine after 24 hours and asked the state commission to prolong my stay in space to three days. And I carried out the entire schedule. Could I have done that if I had been half-dead?","Russia is still the leader in world space exploration. But its position of leader involves great responsibility - we have no right to lag behind. We can and we must move constantly forward.","Cosmonauts can keep their word like men and women - particularly women.","I would enjoy flying to Mars. This was the dream of the first cosmonauts. I wish I could realize it! I am ready to fly without coming back.","I think Star City should have Unesco World Heritage status. It will need to be adapted a little bit and made more glamorous than it looks now, but it should definitely be protected for the future.","I never aimed to be on television or in the press. We all have a personal life, and being a public figure disrupts that.","I see Vostok-6 quite often in the centre for cosmonaut training. And every time I pass it by, I stroke it and say, 'My lovely one, my best and most beautiful friend, my best and most beautiful man.'"],"Valentina Zelyaeva":["I had no idea about nutrition. I thought by eating salads you'll stay skinny.","Diseases happen in acidic environments, so it's very important to keep your body alkaline. Keeping a diet high in leafy greens, spring water, fresh air, raw almonds, lemons, grapefruits, and warm water with juice from half a lemon helps lower acidity levels.","Drink warm water with lemon first thing in the morning. It's a good way to detox and alkalize your body.","Move your lymph system. Lymph is like a sewage system that carries all of the toxins out of your body.","Make one day a mono-meal. This means, choose just one fruit and have it as much as you want. Apples, pears, or anything in season are great for mono-meals.","We are skinny; this is our work. There are lots of overweight people working in offices, but I'm not going to say, 'This girl is fat; she can't work in an office.'","It's a lot harder to stick to my regime when I'm travelling, so when I'm home, I make sure that when I wake up in the morning, I drink one litre of water with lemon to cleanse my body from the inside, and then I'll have a big jar of vegetable juice.","With the juice, I try to put a lot of different kinds of vegetables in there like zucchini, kale and broccoli. It looks scary, but it's so good for your body, and I just love the taste of it. It's so fresh; I love it!","I believe everything is about balance. I'm not 100% vegan, and obviously my fiance and my friends are not vegan, so I have to come up with a menu that will satisfy everybody.","Throughout the day, I'll make a lot of green smoothies or salads, and then when I travel, I try my hardest to just keep up the regime. It's not always easy, but I do my best."],"Valentino Garavani":["I am like a freight train. Working on the details, twisting them and playing with them over the years, but always staying on the same track.","I know what women want. They want to be beautiful.","An evening dress that reveals a woman's ankles while walking is the most disgusting thing I have ever seen.","There are only three things I can do - make a dress, decorate a house, and entertain people.","I love my beauty. It's not my fault.","I have my favourite fashion decade, yes, yes, yes: '60s. It was a sort of little revolution; the clothes were amazing but not too exaggerated.","Unfortunately, the greatest photographers don't pay extreme attention to the clothes. If they decide to put a dress in a bathtub or in front of a cow in the countryside with dirt everywhere, well, the dresses come back... ready to be put in the garbage.","I am especially grateful that I have been able to keep my own style over the decades, in spite of the many changes that have taken place in the world of fashion and in its business.","I like things simple.","Even as a young boy, my passion was to design, and I have been very lucky to be able to do what I have loved all my life. There can be few greater gifts than that.","I hope people will say, 'Mr. Valentino, he did something for fashion, no?'","My first year, people were interested in me because I was new. Then the press started to come.","I am happy that thousands of students, young designers and fashion people will be able to see and study my work in every aspect of it.","I love the 2000s because everyone started to love haute couture.","I didn't like the '80s at all; it was a vulgar moment of fashion.","I am always locked in my design studio."],"Valentino Rossi":["Riding a race bike is an art - a thing that you do because you feel something inside.","Maybe the bike is more dangerous, but the passion for the car for me is second to the bike.","The most important thing is to have a good relationship with the bike... you have to understand what she wants. I think of a motorcycle as a woman, and I know that sounds silly, but it's true.","To be a great motorbike racer, the most important thing is passion for the bike.","I race to win. If I am on the bike or in a car it will always be the same.","My normal life is like being on holiday.","I never race for records. The motivation to try to beat the record is not enough to continue. You have to enjoy it.","The great fights with your strongest rivals are always the biggest motivation. When you win easily it's not the same taste.","It's a big, big advantage because understanding what changes we might make takes time and it takes time to work out settings and to understand everything about the new machine.","Once the races begin it's more difficult and there is never that much time for testing.","I am able to ride the bike and think clearly about strategy and tyres. I also have positive thinking. I am very constructively critical.","As for the level of spectacle of the two disciplines, I leave it to the people who watch the races to comment.","Also, when I started racing he knew a lot of people and it was more easy for me to find the first bike, so I have a good chance for sure.","I don't like being famous - it is like a prison. And driving for Ferrari would make it far worse.","I have a lot of energy after 2 A.M. I like to sleep in the morning. I have some problems at the start of the day.","You look at Moto3, the races are very exciting. Moto2 is fantastic, and then MotoGP is boring.","I was lucky. My father raced bikes. He gave me the passion very early. I had my first bike when I was three or four years old.","I would have probably stolen cars - it would have given me the same adrenaline rush as racing.","To win the Championship in the first year will be hard. We need time to become competitive and win races.","The work that we do during the winter is very important; we have a new bike and it's important to develop it during this time, and we start with this test.","I'm Valentino Rossi. And I want to be a person, not an icon.","Fortunately during my career I have won more or less everything, so I need to enjoy it to have the right motivation.","In 2002 the Yamaha was at more or less the same level as the Honda, better in some ways, worse in others. But in the winter of last year between 2002 and 2003, Honda made a big step forward and it seemed as if Yamaha couldn't quite match that improvement.","I always enjoyed myself a lot in pre-school.","But I could also start F1 or rallying. I love rallying much more.","I have won on Honda and Yamaha so maybe it is interesting to win with a third team, Ducati, who are Italian.","If I test the car for a year I can be quite competitive the next season.","In my opinion we are at the limit now, and 17 races is really too much. With all the testing that we do now, it means we're always on the bike and it's quite difficult.","Maybe if Graziano make another work or another sport I wouldn't have had this passion to be a rider.","We have the 2004 M1 here for reference, which is useful. It worked well here last year; we won the race and always did fast lap times so it will be interesting to compare it to the new bike and it will help us to understand which parts have improved.","How do Ferrari know what I'm doing next year when I don't know what I'm doing next week?","It is a big problem and so I don't know for sure if I say yes or no to Ferrari.","My father raced bikes. He gave me the passion very early. I had my first bike when I was three or four years old."],"Valeria Golino":["I've learned so many things from directors in my acting career. There are even some things I've learned that I didn't want to do. There are those directors who've really made me shine and others who've made me opaque.","I can touch my toes, but I bend in a strange way. I'll never be in the Olympics.","There's no big splashy renaissance in Italian films. We have good young actors and directors. What we lack are screenwriters. It's hard to write about Italy.","When I think of Italy now, I think of accessories, possessions, bad TV, fake boobs, BMWs.","I came to Hollywood and I loved it. It was a great time, but in my head I was still elsewhere, in Europe. I believed in a certain cinema, which I still do believe in - a certain European cinema - and as a young woman being in America, I thought I was being taken away from that.","As an actress you can participate, you can be a co-author, help the director. But I always wanted to be able to make the big decisions.","I worked with fantastic actors, fantastic directors. People I would never otherwise have met. Was I limited? Yes. Did I use it as I could have? No. But I was always ambivalent about Hollywood and what I wanted. And ambivalence in our business is no good for success.","I love acting. I've been doing it since I was 16, and it's in my nature. It's the thing I do best. But as much as I love acting, I love cinema more. I always had a thing about creating images.","'Miele' is a code name for a girl who has a double life.","What I am really curious about is the visuals of cinema... the form.","I think that it helps that I have acted. That said, it doesn't mean you're going to be a good director."],"Valeria Mazza":["Dyeing my hair has become a kind of addiction. I can't see myself as anything other than blond. Once you go blond, you stay blond forever.","It is more important to know how to mix and match the clothes than to spend money.","I think I lost at least 40% of my fans when I became blond. They didn't recognize me anymore.","I'd never stop traveling, and I love bringing my family along with me. My children have points of reference everywhere, friends from Milan to Los Angeles. I think it's really fun for them.","In some countries, women aren't allowed to wear a swimsuit.","What is important is to have values in life. What's important is how you are, not how you look."],"Valerie Azlynn":["I love watching old sitcoms. It's very inspiring to watch 'Mary Tyler Moore' and 'Golden Girls.' I have watched them over and over again for years.","If I could kidnap Bryan Doyle-Murray and force him to be in my family, I would. I love him; I really do.","I started in high school and regional theater. Anything that came into town, I wanted to be involved in, because I just wanted to learn.","I would recommend going out for more independent films. You can get bigger roles and really work your acting chops and build a reel.","On the day of the audition for 'Sullivan and Son,' I had three other auditions all around Los Angeles. It was so hectic. I remember changing in my car before I went in to read.","My idol is Bea Arthur. I really tried to follow her example. She is one of my comedy 'she-roes.'","Do not let yourself get in your own way. Don't judge yourself and knock yourself down. There is enough of that out there already. Remember: you are an artist, and you bring something special to this craft. Take in notes and criticism, but don't let them define you. Don't try to become a watered down version of yourself.","There's something really cool about TV. TV, you get the luxury of having the same people around. It is such a blessing when you get a TV job. You really have a chance to get to make, like, work friends. I think TV is one of the few mediums where I've had the opportunity to get to know my crew members.","Personally, I love theater; that's where I started.","I feel really proud of my work on 'Sullivan & Son.' It's a really different character for me. I was excited to play this really tough, sweet smart, quirky girl because that's who I am at my core, but that's never who I was playing. The show is like my pride and joy.","I like a man with some extra padding.","I love a man with stubble. It's very sexy.","I am not gonna say that a guy's looks make him have to try harder in any way. I don't believe that at all. I think if he is funny, smart and cool, he's all set. Looks are not very important to me.","Working out should be a key part of your life but not your whole life. When it is all a man could talk about, it becomes too much.","I think I have lived in every part of L.A. except downtown. Everywhere from Topanga Canyon to Toluca Lake.","I love the Warner Brothers lot. There is so much history there. They've done such a smart thing. They have signs outside of each stage which tell you what movies and TV shows were shot inside. So cool... you can almost feel the ghosts of actors past."],"Valerie Bertinelli":["Happiness is a choice. You can choose to be happy. There's going to be stress in life, but it's your choice whether you let it affect you or not.","There's going to be stress in life, but it's your choice whether to let it affect you or not.","I've realized that I'm more important than food is. I love a big slice of pizza, but I love myself more. Being thin is about changing the way you think about yourself. It's about saying that you deserve to be healthy.","Honesty is very sexy.","I started thinking: 'Okay, what's wrong with wearing a bikini? I look better than I looked in quite a few years, so why not? What am I afraid of?","I have faith in faith. God is there, whether we have faith or not, so why not have faith in him?","I've got this old-school workout - push-ups, sit-ups, tricep dips. And it worked. Anybody can do this at home.","After a lifetime of losing and gaining weight, I get it. No matter how you slice it, weight loss comes down to the simple formula of calories in, calories out.","I thought, If I'm so afraid of a bikini, there's something wrong. And so I had to get back into one!","Once a food becomes off-limits, then it takes on this whole other personality. 'Forbidden' is more tempting. And it becomes something evil, but food is food. It's there to nourish your body.","I have obsessed about my weight in some sort of way all my life. I used to write in my journal what I weighed every day.","Any partying I did, I did at home. I didn't want to be in the spotlight... There's an easy way to get away from the paparazzi; they're not that difficult to hide from and you don't need to go out for coffee every five minutes.","The only things I really love about myself physically are my ankles and my hair.","I've earned all these years on my face. I don't want to be a liar if in five or 10 years I do get some Botox, but needles in the face scare me, so I don't really know if I am ever going to do that.","Divorce isn't the child's fault. Don't say anything unkind about your ex to the child, because you're really just hurting the child.","I'm a full-time mom right now and a part-time actress.","Ed is very sexy because his emotions are really there - not forced.","If you say you're fat, all of a sudden people like you!","I'm a food addict, that's my downfall.","I think a lot of people think because I was getting the divorce, that was really the catalyst for gaining so much weight.","My eyes aren't special, my nose isn't special, my mouth isn't special.","Professionally, I have no major goals. That's partly because I'm really flaky. I want things, but I don't go after them. I'd rather they be placed in my lap.","I never, ever, ever had deltoids! Oh my God, when I'm doing exercises and I see them pop out, I'm like, Yes!","Anybody can have this body if you do enough sit-ups and you just make a decision that 'Every day, I'm going to work out.' There are some days that I just don't feel like doing it, and I don't. But more often than not I get up and I get on the treadmill that I want to shoot and just do it. The first 20 minutes are the hardest.","We all have our painful pasts we have to get through.","I kept buying bigger and bigger jeans, and once the size 14s got too tight, I thought, That's it. I'm not buying the next size.","As an emotional eater, I eat to soothe.","I'm excellent at losing weight, but I've never been excellent at maintenance. I have some better days than others in terms of being hypervigilant, but with maintenance you don't know if you've been good at it until you're done.","If I sleep in and don't run, I'll feel a little bit off because I didn't do what I was supposed to do. But I'm not going to beat myself up because of it. I'll just get right back on track.","People come up to me and tell me how I changed their life and I've inspired them. And they tell me their stories, and that keeps me going."],"Valerie Cruz":["I'm Cuban, so I know a lot of people who act like vampires. But wait, vampires have to be invited to your house, so maybe they are nothing like Latinos!","I think that Europeans in general have a more global view of the world because they are in such proximity to other countries that it enables them to travel and see other parts of the world.","I would love to adopt a child from a Spanish speaking country, because I want to have Spanish in the home.","Stephen Moyer is probably the most gracious, gifted actor that I've met. He's really intelligent. He has a real sensitivity to his character, to scenes, to scripts.","With network, shows are pulled half the time after three episodes whether they're good or they're not good. It's a numbers game. With cable, they can take a lot more liberties.","With 'Nip/Tuck,' I had never even done anything before I got on that show. They created that character for me. I was reading for something else.","I eat tons of green veggies to keep my PH balance in check.","The best thing I've learned is that you have to listen to your body, and you have to be your own physician. Don't ignore those little groaning aches and pains."],"Valerie Faris":["I think of music videos as commercials for songs.","It's hard to get the right elements together, get the right cast, get them at the time you need them, get the script completely there, and get the right budget.","There's an amazing movie called 'Los Angeles Plays Itself.'","Comedy writing is the hardest, and yet there's so much that's relatable in it.","Some scripts you feel like everything is precious.","I don't watch 'MTV'. Our sons watch 'Jersey Shore' sometimes. I walk through the room, and I get disgusted, and I leave, and I give them a hard time about it.","Like 'TRL' was kind of fun - Oh, there's a new video!","There's something about somebody's first screenplay: it's like their whole life experience has kind of been bottled into it. They bring so much richness to it. And not that they won't do that for their next script, but there is something about their first experience and the time that it's been floating in their head.","Our marriage has survived because we do things we love.","When you study a character, when you're making a film, you want to understand the character: like, what makes them tick?","We were alive during the 'Battle of the Sexes', but that story hadn't really been told.","'Ruby Sparks' has been sold like a romcom in the States. But we never saw it like that.","I like being able to talk about work while we're making dinner. I'd rather discuss it at that moment while it's fresh.","The American dream tells you that you'll have success if you work hard enough, and we have some concerns about that fallacy. Hopefully, the characters in our films learn to redefine success.","I love small films, and I love films being seen in a theater. I love film, and unfortunately, that's being phased out.","If we don't have the actors, or you get the sense that some of the other people involved in making the movie don't necessarily see the movie the way you see it - all those elements, for us, we like having those things feel like they're moving in the same direction.","We had a couple of films that, in the course of working on them, the budget shrank to the point where we couldn't make it. They literally ran the numbers: They took our numbers and the stars' numbers, and when they calculated whether we could make our money back or not, it said no.","I love it when I see somebody else make a great film. I think there is a great supportive film community, even though the awards seem to do something weird to that.","One of the great things about shooting in Los Angeles is you have access to all these great performers. We love working with ensembles, and that process of getting a great group of people together and setting them in motion."],"Valerie Harper":["I've had very deep moments of sadness. What I do is really sob, really cry, do whatever it is, and then kind of release it. Then I can go cook dinner or make a phone call to a friend.","Life has sweetness to it and a beauty and a power that I wanted to celebrate.","Forgiving is giving up the wish that things could have been different. They weren't. That's the past. Let it go.","As physics has proven, we're ultimately particulate matter, which means we are all one. That's why racial and gender bias is so ridiculous.","I felt sharing my experience may be of value or assistance in some way to others.","The movie that really 'did it for me' was 'All About Eve.' The backstage feeling, the authenticity, the passion those people had for their lives in the theater. I must say, the movie 'All About Eve,' what a great movie! 'All About Eve' had a profound effect on my life.","Life does not owe me a shred.","We're all terminal; none of us are getting out of this alive.","Cancer reminds me of a very bad but tenacious performer who, although no one wants to see, insists on doing an encore, having a return engagement, making a comeback and, worst of all, going on tour.","I think you just take each day and get the best out of it and do what you can and have fun.","When I wake up in the morning, I don't say, 'Oh, I have cancer. I say 'Another day. How you feeling? Good? Good.'","It can be frightening. I think, 'I don't want to go.' But I give myself room to grieve.","Don't accept or be crippled by the media hype that aging is bad or shameful.","Don't go to the funeral until the day of the funeral. Live this day.","I love sitting at home. I love laying in bed watching television.","Do not tell somebody how to vote, just go up to them and tell them what Fahrenheit 9/11 meant to you. Fahrenheit will probably not win an Academy Award, but if you put it first on your list, it will become a nominee.","I used to get some ego thing out of saying I wasn't a star, just an actress. Forget it. I'm a star. I wanted it. I worked for it. I got it.","I'm painfully middle class.","I really want Americans, and all of us, to be less afraid of death, and know that it's a passage, but that - don't go to the funeral before the day of the funeral.","I'm trying to live every moment as much as I can.","We all have a way to contribute, to your community, to your family, whatever it is you can do.","As long as you're alive, you can do something.","I wouldn't give people advice except to share with them what I'm doing, which is, You're alive - stay alive.","I'm not dying until I do.","I don't have a reputation of being a super-witch who demands pink rugs in the dressing room.","Comedy is saving me.","Don't live in fear of dying.","Every five minutes, every hour, every day, every year that you waste worrying about your cancer - you have forfeited time that you could have been alive having fun.","I had always wanted a steady job in this business, a show that lasted.","Actors often want to look like they're comfortable. You want to go into an audition saying, 'I'm your gal. I'm what you need.' Yet you don't want to push.","I've always done character roles and tons of movies as the so-called star, but I always felt I was one of the team.","I never did stand-up. If I've been funny ever, it was with other actors.","I have cancer. It's in my brain... What are you gonna do about it?","With imagery, as actors know, you can make up anything you want to. You can put yourself in icy water to get rid of this or that.","Above all, learn to live when you're dying.","Sometimes I yell at my cancer cells, sometimes I make myself laugh.","Really appreciate the sunset as you're driving home, cursing all the terrible drivers on the road. Be where you are when you're there rather than out there in the future or back there in the past.","It's really important that we don't hang up the membership to the human community at menopause.","You have to look life in the face, doing what you can where you can.","Talk about a woman of a certain age - Pearl Buck was a great prototype of continuing to work. She was in the hospital dying of cancer, and in the next room was her secretary, typing out her next book.","I'm talking about enjoying and finding pleasure and interest and happiness and curiosity every moment.","What we really wanted to call it was 'I Rhoda Book.'","Knowing that you have something you have to deal with, rising to the occasion, builds character.","Though I'm 75, I'm not looking forward to death, but it's there for all of us.","If I wake up in the night terrified, I try to find a way to not let the fear have me. Every moment you spend in fear of cancer is a moment you've wasted enjoying life. Replace that fear - get in the moment and enjoy it.","I'm a perfect person to tell people not to give up.","If you die, you're not a failure.","Luck is not an acceptable substitute for early detection.","I have an intention to live each moment fully.","I first met Rhoda Morgenstern in the spring of 1970.","Live fully in the instant.","I never smoked in my life. Neither did my mother. And so many women I meet whose mothers or aunts or whoever who have gotten lung cancer were no-time smokers.","Mine's called leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. It's incurable. It's terminal. And it's in a tiny space - a huge area all around the brain and up and down the spine. But it's small area where the spinal fluid is. It's microscopic. You can't see it. It isn't lumps that they can say, 'Oh we can zap that.'","I'm happier because I had to face what all of us try not to face: that we're going to die. It's a fact.","I've always been a team player.","We think it's food that matters the most, but exercise and food both matter.","Life is amazing; live it to the fullest. Stay as long as you can.","All of us have the same thing coming - death. It's waiting. But I don't want to go. I want to live to be 102!","The body is just a rooming house.","I've had a lot of great stuff - spectacular stuff - happen to me. I've got to not be a pig about life.","There are times when I cry. I'll sit in the chair and feel the depression, let it seethe. Then it starts to go away, and I find myself laughing, saying, 'Well, that was dramatic.'","Miracles occur, or people die the next day.","Don't waste the time you do have.","When I heard 'incurable'... incurable is a tough word.","All of us are going to die. Every single one of us. So, while you're alive, be alive.","I am a cancer patient, and I continue to fight with the hope that a cure may be just around the corner. I am grateful to my family, friends, loved ones, and to fans that I am in their thoughts and prayers. That support gives me great hope.","We have a lot of fear around death, and I thought maybe I can help somebody... I want people to be less scared.","Keep your chin up, and don't go to the funeral - mine or yours or your loved one's - until the day of the funeral because then you miss the life that you have left.","Death is out there for all of us.","I have had a magnificent run.","I don't wake up saying, 'Oh, I'm going to die.' It's a waste of time. It really is.","I have had acupuncture regularly, and I engage in visualization, which is actually an actor's tool, visualizing myself kicking out the cancer, making up scenarios.","I've always felt very strongly about human rights for blacks, women, and gays. Our Constitution is about equality for all - that's got to mean something to all of us.","Whatever happens, who cares.","My husband is the best caregiver in the world.","I don't know a great deal about Alzheimer's - just what it does.","I'm now the poster child for not believing everything I'm told.","The first Broadway play I ever saw was 'The Bad Seed' by Maxwell Anderson and with Patty McCormack. 'The Bad Seed' was from an extraordinary novel by William March.","I really developed an early love for ballet. Like most dancers, I am still 'first' a dancer. I'm very proud of it. Once you are a dancer, the physicality never leaves you, nor does the strength. Hopefully, it keeps you like an athlete.","Daddy was a salesman and away a lot, always working. My mom took me to the movies on Thursday nights because it was dish night, when they gave you a free dish along with your movie ticket.","The disease I have is quite a rare cancer, and it is located in a limited area - a very widespread area, but narrow. So a lot can happen if the cancer starts getting really aggressive, pressing on parts of the brain and causing me to lose either my speech or my ability to think, etc.","I really look at my life as blessed.","I really got the 'Rhoda' flavor from studying my stepmother, Angela, who's Italian, not Jewish. There's really so little difference between the speech patterns and family attitudes of Jews and Italians in the New York area, anyway.","I'm basically an actress, not a comedienne, and if something comes along that appeals to me, I'll do it.","I am pretty heavy into causes. I'm an active Democrat, I boycott grapes, and I work for prison reform.","I don't see anything degrading about marriage or homemaking, but my husband and I pool the money we earn, along with the jobs around the house.","I know there are a whole bunch of 'Rhoda' rooters out there.","'Incurable' is a tough word. So is 'terminal.'","I think drama and comedy are pretty much all the same, and the issue is whether or not you have a sense of humor.","On 'Rhoda,' they wanted my husband, Joe, to wear a pajama top when we were doing love scenes. They finally let him take it off as long as the audience saw him get into bed wearing pajama bottoms so they didn't think he was completely naked underneath.","We don't know what's around the corner.","I've had a good run; what more can I ask for?","I think I have too little to hide to be interesting.","Magazines airbrush everything. If you think it's an illusion, then it probably is.","Women and young girls are constantly judging themselves by standards that aren't real.","At an ERA fundraiser years ago, one of my favorite buttons was the one that said, 'Every mother is a working mother.'","Stop working so hard at being interesting and focus on what's outside yourself. There are universes out there that need to be explored. And, an interested person is extremely interesting.","Anything I can give women to help them feel better about themselves, that's what I want to do.","When you age, you can do all kinds of roles. You don't have to look great. You can be the mom, the aunt. You can have a small part. You're an actor.","That's very unusual for an actor, to have gainful employment that they are secure in, that they know is going to be there year after year.","I was a dancer, but I was always a little overweight. I'd say, 'Hello, I'm Valerie Harper, and I'm overweight.' I'd say it quickly before they could... I always got called chubby. My nose was too wide; my hair was too kinky.","Rhoda Morgenstern gave a wonderful impetus and propulsion to my career.","My stepmother Angela is an Italian from New York City. I based Rhoda on her and a Jewish friend named Penny Ann Green. People often said that Rhoda seemed to be Italian. That was the Angela seeping through.","Pearl Buck was my mother's favorite author.","My mother was a Book of the Month Club devotee. I remember she always looked forward to Pearl Buck's books.","I loved working in the theater.","I danced in choruses from about 1959 to 1967, in 'Take Me Along,' 'Wildcat,' and 'Subways Are for Sleeping.'"],"Valerie Jarrett":["The question is, does the punishment fit the crime? So we're not saying that we shouldn't punish people. We're not talking about a society that tolerates lawlessness. We should be very tough on people who are perpetuating violent crimes, for example. But we should make sure that it's tailored and not arbitrary.","Overcoming adversity not only makes you stronger, it makes you more hopeful.","Let's figure out ways of keeping our children out of the juvenile justice system and in the classroom so that they'll thrive. Because if you're in the juvenile justice system, the chances of your going into the adult penal system are greatly increased.","Employers who recognize the importance of investing in their workforce have a more productive workforce, a more efficient workforce, a more loyal workforce, less turnover, and, in the private sector, more profitable.","We do have to ask ourselves as a culture, what do we want to be? You know, what are our founding values? And if we are a society where everybody should have that fair shot and get a second chance, then we should take the necessary steps to implement that and make it a reality.","When you break glass ceilings, you're going to get minor scrapes by a shard or two from the glass.","If I take a bump or bruise along the way, that's nothing compared to the sacrifices that the women whose shoulders I stand upon made along the way.","We want to make sure that we incentivize the health care system to be designed to provide you the best quality health care possible.","I don't want to just tell my story - I want to share the experiences, life lessons, and values that have shaped who I am and my ideas for the future.","I was very lucky - I grew up with two parents who loved each other and gave me unconditional love. They set high expectations for me, and they gave me an infinite amount of support. So I stand on their shoulders; I follow their example in every way.","The tech community has taken the first step by recognizing that diversity is a strength and realizing that many of them have to work on their culture.","That's what America's all about. Entrepreneurs who can start a business in their basement and have it grow into a global company - that's exactly what we want.","It's never too early to start thinking about tuition.","What makes a lot of sense is that, while people are incarcerated, give them the tools they need to be able to have a productive, lucrative living when they leave so they can provide for their families and break that cycle of recidivism.","I wouldn't trade the best days of my life in the private sector for the worst days of my life in the public sector.","Given the daunting challenges that we face, it's important that president elect Obama is prepared to really take power and begin to rule day one.","We are a country that believes in free speech and the open debate of ideas. We're a country that also believes in the Second Amendment and our ability to have guns. But we've got to figure out a way to keep America safe.","As we try to compete in this global marketplace, we need to rebuild our infrastructure. We need to rebuild our schools. We need to make sure that teachers and first responders and veterans who are coming home from serving our country so proudly have jobs waiting for them.","What are we going to do to make sure people get the skills they need if they are incarcerated so that when they are released to hit the ground running? And what are we all going to do to give people who've earned a second chance, a second chance?","My goal in the new administration is to engage all of the stakeholders, everyone who can help us meet the challenges of the 21st century, and ensure that we work together.","We have held forums here at the White House on workplace flexibility, and the first major bill signed into law by President Obama was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. Lilly was here a few weeks ago because we were trying very hard to push paycheck fairness through the Congress. Unfortunately, we fell two votes short.","Part of what makes America strong is our resilience, tenacity, innovation and our willingness to be optimistic about our future. I know that President Obama is absolutely the best president to lead our country in the right direction.","I want everyone to feel empowered. Everyone can do something.","Encouraging the next generation is really where my heart is.","The last six months of the Bush administration lost four million jobs and the first six months of the Obama administration lost another four million before any initiatives of the president could take action.","If you are not diverse and you are not listening to all voices and have your ear to the ground, you're not going to make the best decisions.","We need to be investing in manufacturing and small businesses. We need to be creating a workforce where Americans can compete in a global marketplace because they have the necessary skills. And we need fairness, and we need a sustainable, strong economy that's durable for the future.","Just because somebody says no doesn't mean that you have to listen. You can do what you think is right.","I was very heartened by Rupert Murdoch's passionate interest in immigration reform. He is an immigrant himself. He understands from a business perspective how important immigration reform would be to our economy.","The biggest strength we have as Democrats is encouraging people to speak up about what is in their best interest.","When you are in local government, you are on the ground, and you are looking into the eyes and hearts of the people you are there to serve. It teaches you to listen; it teaches you to be expansive in the people with whom you talk to, and I think that that engagement gives you political judgment.","The impact of solitary confinement can have a devastating consequence to the psychology of the people who are affected.","Sexual orientation and gender identity are not a choice, and anyone who knows me and my work over the years knows that I am a firm believer and supporter in the rights of LGBT Americans.","Own your choices. Don't feel ashamed about what you're doing, trust yourself that you're a good parent, don't let anybody else shame you, and, certainly, don't shame yourself.","We know the threats - from global terrorist networks to the spread of deadly weapons. Yet we also know that embedded in this time of danger is the promise of a new day, if we have the courage and commitment to work together.","Every woman needs to know when she's being discriminated against and what the reasons are why she isn't getting equal pay so we can close that pay gap.","I know it may be hard to imagine given how broken and gridlocked our politics truly are, but from the White House to, yes, Congress, the government is filled with hard-working, idealistic public servants working incredibly hard on tough issues, trying to make people's lives better and move the country, and our world, forward.","If left unchecked, global change will create violent conflict, torrential storms, shrinking coastlines, and irreversible catastrophe.","The President has been a big proponent of the public option since the campaign.","There are certain things that Americans expect their government to do. Our infrastructure is vitally important. Putting people back to work with construction is important. Our roads, our bridges, our sewers, our waterways, our dams - this is what makes our country so special.","My view has always been that marriage means love, and an excellent way of describing your love for another person is to make that permanent commitment.","Equal pay, paid leave, paid sick days, workplace flexibility, and affordable childcare - everywhere I go around the United States, as I talk to working families, these are the issues they raise... We have over 43 million Americans who don't have a single day of sick leave, but everybody gets sick. Everybody's children get sick.","Each generation has an obligation to pick up the baton. We want young people to feel a sense of responsibility to take that baton and run with it.","My daughter is, of course, perfect. Everyone's child is, but mine really is perfect. But I could not have raised her without my parents. From the time she was seven months until now, I have been a single parent.","President Obama celebrates diversity, yet instinctively seeks common ground and builds on that common ground to make progress.","But if I were to sum up who Barack Obama is and how he plans to meet this moment with one word, that word would be 'responsibility.' Responsibility to each other, our families, our communities, our country, and our world.","Financial regulatory reform is one of the top legislative priorities of the Obama Administration.","The Recovery plan will put money in the pockets of the American worker, create and save millions of new jobs and invest in crucial areas such as health care, education, energy independence and a new infrastructure.","Instead of sitting on the sidelines, President Obama has made it clear that the US is ready to lead a global effort to combat climate change.","A new era of responsibility is here.","No one will be forced to take the public option. The word option means choice.","For those that are working part time, in small businesses, or who are unemployed and do not currently have health insurance, we want to make sure that you are covered.","One of the major goals of health insurance reform is to bring down the cost.","Please be assured that as we move along through the implementation of health insurance reform, making sure that we find efficiencies within the existing system, is foremost on the President's mind.","Our whole philosophy is one of transparency.","The United States is a strong and ardent ally of Israel. The fact of the matter is that friends can disagree. I think what's important is that world leaders are able to sit down with one another, have frank conversations and move forward.","I care so passionately about improving the quality of life for women and girls, not just here in the United States, but internationally as well. I am a single mom and I raised a daughter who is now a young adult.","I moderated a panel focusing just on women and the specific challenges that women entrepreneurs face. And we found that around the world, the challenges are the same, whether it is gaining access to capital, risk-taking, or the ability to expand beyond a small business and grow.","The long term sustainable growth in job creation comes from the private sector. It is important that the Obama administration partner with the private sector and come up with the best possible ideas for creating jobs.","President Obama stands ready to work with everyone, because that's what the American people expect and deserve - not for the short term political advantages, but the long term health of our country. We don't spend time trying to figure out what's in the minds of Republicans, we try to keep our focus on the American people.","People are struggling. They're trying to make ends meet, and they're looking for Washington to deliver for them. And they don't feel that that's been happening as quickly as it should. We share that frustration. There's no one more frustrated than President Obama.","The whole issue of healthcare is very complicated. There have been seven Presidents who've tried to get healthcare reform passed.","I just worry a lot. I'm a worrier. Michelle and Barack are really dear to me. I mean, I love them. And I don't want to see them get hurt. Just the nature of politics is hurtful. So every time they are hurt, I get hurt. It's a lot to ask of people, and it's a lot to see your friends go through. It's hard not to get emotional.","One of the problems I have with the administration is that they're not tough enough. They are waiting for BP to say, 'Oh, we've got a new plan to stop the oil leak.' They need to stop it, contain it, clean it up.","Barack's mother was very important to him, but he spent a great deal of his life living in a different place. So, as all kids do, you always have a fantasy of what perfection would be. And my guess is that Michelle's childhood was his idea of perfection. It allowed him to anchor himself with her and with her family.","It's a big, complicated democracy, and one of the strengths of our country is... its rich diversity.","What do we do to just rebuild and focus on creating a big and inclusive tent, where we're focusing on making sure every child gets that fair shot, that every woman gets to compete on a level playing field, that we are true to the core values of our country, and we're making sure that we honor those values?","We have programs that are outdated and no longer effective - we need to get rid of those programs.","In any given day, our administration has about 2 million employees, and things happen. We put in process procedures to make sure if there has been any wrongdoing, there will be appropriate consequences, and we will move on.","We have every confidence that people within the White House have behaved appropriately.","Nondiscrimination has been the law of the land for over three decades, yet, in some workplaces, the standard for treatment of pregnant women has remained in the dark ages. Some are fired or demoted, with no hesitation, when a modest accommodation would allow them to continue to work and support their families.","I vividly remember early on in my career when I was eight months pregnant, working literally around the clock, and worrying that each trip to the restroom or my need to catch the occasional catnap was causing my colleagues to question whether I could keep up.","With women composing nearly half the American workforce and increasingly serving as the primary breadwinner for families, we can't afford to treat pregnant women differently than their counterparts, especially when slight job modifications could help them stay in the workforce at no risk to their health.","Working parents, working families, and expectant workers are vital members of our workforce. Ensuring their success is how we maintain our global economic advantage.","I don't play golf. I don't play basketball. I don't really like cards. I don't think anybody questions whether or not I have a role to play here. And so I think it is irrelevant whether the president wants to do that in some of his free time. What's really important is, when we have something to say, does he listen to us?","Married in 1983, separated in 1987, and divorced in 1988. Enough said.","I saw a complete lack of courage in Washington to tackle some of our biggest challenges.","Where I underestimated the opposition was how willing Republicans in Congress would be to put their short-term political interests ahead of what they knew was good for their country. That was extremely disappointing.","There's a strong body of evidence that shows that the more diligent we are in ensuring that guns are in the appropriate hands, the safer our communities will be.","I don't know how to code. I should know how to code.","Many of our advances in science and technology were seeded through government.","Do you want to get rid of the rules of the road? Do you want to let everybody just do whatever they want to do? Or do you want to really look out for the consumer, look out for the American people, and figure out ways to create and foster an environment where companies want to double down on America?","I didn't think I'd even know a president of the United States, let alone work in the White House. Even though my parents always said you can do whatever you want to do, I never dreamed of this kind of an opportunity.","I want spend some time continuing to be a force for good.","So much of what I do is so strictly confidential that it's nice to be able to discuss or vent or laugh about something and not read about it in the newspaper the next day.","You can't just shuffle people around like they're deck chairs on a ship. You have to help them change their lives, and you have to give them the requisite resources to do so.","When you compare the relatively modest tax that will ensue from prohibiting companies from receiving a subsidy and deducting that subsidy, the benefits dramatically outweigh the costs.","Throughout the health-insurance reform process, we have had a frequent and consistent dialogue with the business community - small, medium, and large - to analyze and evaluate the impact that reform would have on them. It has been a very instructive and productive dialogue.","Companies have told us that they have employees who are near retirement age. We created a $5 billion reinsurance pool to help them bear the cost of those employees on the brink of retirement.","No child should be expelled from preschool. And so we are calling on school districts around the country to end that practice. That benefits every child.","If you're in a family unit... and the boys are having a particularly hard time, the impact on the entire family is troublesome.","Let's put in place programs to ensure that all of our children are reading by third grade.","I will admit that I often spend weekends after each 'House of Cards' season is released binge-watching the show for hours. But I watch it because it is entertaining, not because it reminds me of my day-to-day.","Some people might have different ideas about what progress looks like, and some are cynical and place their short-term political interests ahead of what is good for our country. But many of them aren't cynical and try hard to do their best.","I am hopeful about our future and sure that, despite our challenges, engaging our government remains essential in the journey toward perfecting our union.","I had a very good friend who was two years older than I was, and she was in law school, and she said, 'It's a great thing to do when you have no idea what you want to do.' And she was right. I learned a lot, I practiced law for 10 years. I've never looked back once I stopped practicing law, but it was a really good experience.","When I finished law school, I had a 10-year plan. My plan was to go to a law firm, fall madly in love, have a baby by the time I was 30, make partner, and live happily ever after.","I finally said, 'I don't care if you're the first person in your family to be a lawyer.' Everybody thought what I was doing was really exciting, but it was not moving me one bit. And that's when I decided to join city government in Chicago, and that changed my life.","One miscalculation I made is I did not fully appreciate that the Republicans in Congress were going to just say no to everything. Even when there are ideas that have traditionally been bipartisan.","My theory is this: Rather than having commentaries from the cheap seats, get involved and see what you can do. What can you do around your own community, within your own family, to try to improve race relations in our country? I think this is a responsibility that we all have as citizens.","I certainly hope that we can all continue to be forces for good after leaving the White House.","For me, the passions and issues I care so much about are ones that lend themselves to work whether you're in government or outside of government.","What we wouldn't want to see is just a piece of legislation on border security and high tech immigration without focusing on the path to citizenship for the 11 million people who are here, and other provisions.","I'm a beneficiary of an extraordinary education, and I believe that no matter where you live, the access to education is key to social mobility.","The United States is a great, great country, but it's not the only country, and we can learn a great deal beyond our own shores.","We have to tell the stories of the everyday Americans who are adversely impacted by these policies. That's how we were able to keep the Affordable Care Act from being repealed. People told their stories; people showed up at Town Hall.","I realize that I was being the kind of parent that I thought my daughter needed. I was a good role model for her on what a working mom can do.","Life is full of trade-offs. At different phrases in your life, you're able to do certain things that you can't do at other phases. And you make choices.","I wasn't burdened by a personal history of prejudice. It's part of why I thought Barack could win.","You can have it all, but not all at once.","By 30, I was separated from my husband, and I clearly remember sitting in my lovely office with a magnificent view, staring at a very lucrative pay stub, and bursting into tears because I was just miserable. So I had to make a decision: Keep following my plan, or be honest with myself and search for my true passion.","I had my daughter when I was pretty young, 28, and I had to sacrifice not going out with my friends, and I had to figure out how to juggle both raising her and also a very demanding job.","I'm always trying to improve. I think I take criticism constructively.","I'm kind of old to change. But if somebody were to come to me and say, 'You know what, Valerie? I think if you were to do this it would be more helpful,' of course I would listen to that.","A big part of our agenda is to position the United States for long-term sustainable growth and health, and those jobs come from the private sector.","When you're a member of a team, when I was member of a team, whether I ultimately agreed or disagreed, once a president makes a decision, everybody, in my opinion, has to go with that decision, or you shouldn't be a member of the team. Your reputation rises and falls with the person who's the leader of the team.","What keeps me up at night is worrying about the moms who depend on ACA for all of the preventive care and not to mention prenatal care, the wellness visits, and the cost of delivery.","I am both delighted and honored to return to the University of Chicago as a Distinguished Senior Fellow and embark on this new journey with the students, faculty, and wider Chicago community.","With a rich history, a world-class interdisciplinary program, and a vibrant student experience, I can't think of a better location to continue my own lifelong learning than the University of Chicago.","I've had people say to me, 'Well, I enjoy going to the firing range and using the assault weapons.' But the pleasure derived from that compared to the horrendous damage that it can do, we believe that the damage warrants banning assault weapons.","We wouldn't take a gun away from a law-abiding citizen. We wouldn't take a gun away from anyone.","The American people want change. They don't want the same old health care system that's not affordable, that doesn't offer coverage to everybody, that keeps escalating in cost. And what we've seen from the Republicans is, really, a desire to have the status quo.","We don't want to get distracted by looking back; we need to move forward.","To know the first lady is to love Michelle.","I still vividly remember the moment I let go of an embrace with my daughter on her college campus - that, in her opinion, probably lasted far too long. I left the most precious thing in my life in the care of an institution, and that's a very hard thing to do.","Every president learns in the course of your time in office, but the American people have the right to expect that you walk in the door prepared for the job.","Our democracy... is only as good as the American people demand it should be.","I'm uncomfortable with men making decisions that affect women's health."],"Valerie June":["I am a boring loner. I enjoy Friday nights at home in my rocking chair with no arms, rocking and relaxing. It's not uncommon for Netflix to be involved. Records are a possibility, but most of it is spent in silence.","I don't marry bandmates just to go marrying bandmates.","Saturdays are set for antique shops. Williamsburg in Brooklyn has some good ones. I get in there and start meddling around with dusty boxes and rickety, worn-in stuff. I like it when I find something with someone else's name on it.","I must stay true to myself and take my own path all the way.","It is such a gift to be able to write songs in general, but when you can share it with somebody, it is just such a pleasure. It is such a happy moment when you finish a song, and you are just like, 'Wow - that was great.'","Amalgamation is a good word that I like to use - musically and in every way.","When I first moved to New York, I was still returning to Tennessee every few months to perform.","I try to write down every song that comes to me, even though I know that every song that comes to me isn't a song that I need to sing.","I met PJ Harvey when I was in England, and the first thing I want to do when I meet a songwriter I admire is to ask them how do they receive songs.","When I was writing 'Shotgun,' it's one of the first songs that's come to me as an image.","As soon as I could talk, I was bellowing at the top of my lungs. My parents couldn't get over how weird I sounded - like an old man when I was just a toddler! But no one was gonna shut me up.","I was working like a dog as a housekeeper, barista, nanny, cook, so I could save enough money to really sit with my instruments. Whenever I had 20 minutes, I would practice a new chord or write a new verse.","As I try to get around with a guitar, a banjo and a suitcase of high heels and dresses, I treasure that little ukulele.","If I have something inside me that I want to get out, I'll just beat it out on the banjo right then and there.","When I was really little, I loved Whitney Houston. I thought she was the prettiest thing in the world.","My signature fragrance would be herbal - basil mixed with rosemary and coriander. Some big stars have got perfume lines that smell really bad. They've got it all wrong.","One day, when we were coming back from school, we saw this big cloud of smoke coming up, and all these fire-trucks in the yard. The garage was burning down. I was 14, and we'd lost everything.","When you listen to my music, you hear that there are all these voices going on in different parts of the song. That's because I was always around so many voices in church.","When I was 15, I begged my grandfather to give me this guitar he'd always had in the back of his closet. I promised him I'd learn to play it, but I never did. Then my grandfather died, and I felt so guilty. So I started playing.","I paid my dues. I have crawled to gigs. I have served people coffee. I worked hard selling all these records out the back of my car. Girl, I'm ready to sell one the real way now.","My number one style requirement is to have fun getting dressed. Nothing is too old, expensive, cheap, cute or ugly for me.","I grew my dreadlocks 12 years ago because they give me the freedom to roll out of bed and not spend hours on my woolly, thick hair. I get tons of dropped jaws and compliments, so I reckon folks like them all right.","The challenge is how strange and different my voice sounds, so I have tried to sound like other people and tried to be something I wasn't. I have tried to be a soul singer because someone else thought that a good idea. Not because I did.","My music confuses people because they think I will sound a certain way because I look a certain way with the dreads.","My voice is who I am, who I was when I was 3, and who I am going to be when I am 90 years old. When I hit the stage and people do not know who I am, they automatically assume, before I open my mouth, I am going to sing a Bob Marley song!","Every writer writes in different ways, and so some write the music first, while others write the lyrics first, and some write while they are doing other things, and it is just nice to see how other writers are writing.","I am always excited about playing in front of live audiences because I really enjoy it, for the most part.","I just let the songs tell me what to do - they are my guides, and they are the boss. So I am subservient to the songs, and I let them tell me what to do. I don't judge them; I just write whatever comes to me.","I like performing live more than anything. I get a little bit afraid in the studio.","I just love music, and I absorbed what I love.","I'm not really into alternative country - I'm into Patsy Cline, who lived down the street from where I lived, and old Dolly Parton records, Kitty Wells and that old stuff. I like country music. I also like Eric Church, who has a great new sound but also holds onto that old sound.","When I was teenager, Britney Spears was it - that was the pop world that was happening, and I knew I wasn't in it.","I'm constantly being inspired by the old days and taking things from the past and allowing them to lift me up where I am now.","I don't care if you're Muslim or Christian or Buddhist or whatever your religion is, when you listen to a spiritual song and you really open your heart, you can feel it. You can feel the message of it. Just a simple story.","I've been busy and need to slow my little tail down and sit and meditate somewhere. I do my walking meditations every day, but just to sit still. Just to be in one place and just to be quiet."],"Valerie Plame":["My take is, privacy is precious. I think privacy is the last true luxury. To be able to live your life as you choose without having everyone comment on it or know about.","The truth is, as long as nuclear weapons exist, we are not safe.","I am angry when I hear things like Cheney whispering into Bush's ear on the way to Obama's inauguration to ask him to pardon 'Scooter' Libby and not to 'leave a soldier on the battlefield'. What kind of metaphor is that for his petty partisan views, when you have men and women giving the ultimate sacrifice? I have nothing but contempt.","My CIA colleagues were smart, dedicated, funny, and creative. Yes, there was sometimes stifling bureaucracy, boredom, colleagues who never should have been there, and later, deeply disturbing stories of the CIA's involvement in torture. Still, I got to do work I thought was incredibly important and, many times, had fun doing it.","The options are war versus peace, and I am delighted that, so far, it appears that peaceful negotiation has won the day.","I really believe the nexus of terrorism and nuclear weapons is the world's most ominous threat.","When President Ronald Reagan negotiated some significant arms reduction deals with the then-Soviet Union, he was considered a real hero, someone who was advocating for peace.","Looking back at my career, I wish I knew then what I know now... that gender bias is built into the system, and it's unconscious in many ways. I wish I had the maturity and courage to have pushed back more. I was always trying to be a 'good girl' and play by the rules.","Joe was being called a liar and a traitor; I'm being accused of nepotism, of being a glorified secretary. The stresses that that places on an individual and, of course, a marriage were tremendous. It was - there were some dark days.","These are issues we've been grappling with since the Constitution was written: how you hold your government to account for its words and deeds. It's all about power and the abuse of power.","When an issue is so fraught with partisanship, a special counsel provides some modicum of transparency and accountability rather the the veil of politics.","I was working for the CIA and prohibited from speaking publicly.","I don't care if you are for having Mexico pay for the border wall, or you want to repeal and replace Obamacare, or if you want women to have complete access to reproductive rights - I don't care. The fact is, if you don't get the nuclear issue right, none of the other ones matter.","I have always been appalled by the depiction of female CIA operatives.","The entire intelligence community is so bloated and so reliant on contractors. There's no question there's many tasks that make sense to outsource, and yet, we have followed blindly this dogma that if it's private contracting, it must be better.","I go to my kids' sports games and don't have to carry the enormous burden of secrecy with me every day. However, adrenaline still courses through my body whenever I go through passport control to another country.","I did a book event with a former colleague, Bob Bauer, and was so relieved that he said I got all the CIA stuff right.","The intelligence community really is a vast bureaucratic entity, and it has been politicized in ways that are not effective for the gathering of intelligence and giving it to senior policymakers.","When you're in the CIA, you anticipate the possibility that you'll be betrayed by a foreign government or a source, but you never anticipate that it would be by your own government.","Hollywood does tend to portray CIA officers as totally the honey trap. Looks matter as they do in any profession. But the most important thing for me when I was working was blending into my environment.","Hair and make-up always helps. I did always try to be well-groomed, professional at all times. Take your job seriously - but not yourself.","The human and environmental devastation caused by nuclear weapons - whether by testing, mistake or malice - is the very reason we need to eliminate them altogether.","Privatization is more efficient and effective in some cases, but not in intelligence.","I do not subscribe to the 'Trump is crazy like a fox' thing. I think that's being too generous.","The great thing about fiction is you can fix things and make things better.","There is definitely a sense that when you, as a CIA ops officer... are handling assets, they are delivering to you their trust and their well-being. And you feel very protective of them, even if they're not very nice people.","It's lonely. That's why, in many ways, the CIA is the world's biggest dating agency, I think. I imagine it's much like two actors that get married because they understand that universe. You know, I'm pretty sure the agency's divorce rate is rather high.","I love my career. I thought, if I was lucky, I would retire as a senior intelligence officer, still working on the issues of counterproliferation. But that didn't happen, so - new chapter.","When I was outed on July 14th, 2003, I was, until that moment, covert. That means no one outside of a very small circle knew where I really worked.","Our mission was to make sure that the bad guys, basically, did not get nuclear weapons.","I certainly didn't reach out to my old assets and ask 'em how they're doing, although I would have liked to.","Our critics would love nothing more for us to go away and just be quiet. And we won't give them that satisfaction. We have young children that, one day, when they understand more of what's happened and what's transpired, we wanna be able to say to them, you know, we did our best. And we told the truth.","How lucky are we to have Naomi Watts and Sean Penn playing us? We've seen the final cut now a couple times, and the scenes with the marriage fraying at the edges are still very difficult to watch. However, our hope was that no matter your political persuasion, you're taken with the idea that it's important to hold power in check.","When you work for the C.I.A. or as a diplomat, or serve in the military, you're not serving as a Democrat or a Republican; you serve as an American, whatever your personal moral compass or political views might be. So that would describe me.","Of course we wish that more people involved in the leak of my true CIA identity had been prosecuted, but the system worked.","Americans want to believe that we are a nation of laws, and no one is above them, including the president. Mr. Trump's and his associates' actions during his campaign and during his brief time in office are extremely troubling.","If Russia did interfere in our election - and, by most accounts, they did - then it is imperative for the health of our democracy to have a thorough and unbiased investigation into the matter.","There is not adequate whistleblower protection.","I've been working with Global Zero. They are a great organization leading the resistance against nuclear war and the elimination of nuclear weapons.","We don't have to sit by while Trump uses his enormous global platform to undermine our national security. We would love to be able to actually force Twitter's hand to live up to its rules, explicitly forbidding hate speech and encouraging violence.","Whatever you think of Trump, I think most people would agree he is impulsive, and we certainly have an impulsive leader in North Korea in Kim Jong-un. That's an unholy combination.","The fundamental problem is not that Trump has access to the nuclear launch codes, but that they exist at all.","To my knowledge, no one has died from a cyberattack... but there is a gray area between peace and war.","I believe in much more diplomacy, not less.","I find it really hard to relate to the Bond women or Angelina Jolie in 'Salt.' And of course it's informed by my experiences and the people I've met along the way and the places I've been.","I think feeling bitter or angry is really useless.","Of course the job has a lot of glamour. But it really is about being smarter than your average bear. Your mind is your best weapon. It's great when you're a good shot with an AK-47, but it's about being clever.","There's a huge impact on national security and intelligence. The new normal is going to be more and more of these hacks, whether it's Target or Home Depot or the Office of Personnel Management or Jennifer Lawrence's nude photos.","From a counter-intelligence viewpoint, the OPM breach is really scary - but if we continue to see the erosion of purely commercial enterprises, where people lose confidence, the economy falters.","I've moved on to Plan B now, writing novels.","I would never jeopardize classified information. I served my country well and loyally, and I had to sue the C.I.A. on First Amendment grounds.","Leaks are always bad news.","I can tell you, all the intelligence services in the world were running my name through their databases to see did anyone by this name come in the country? When? Do we know anything about it? Where did she stay? Who did she see?","I think, honestly, my largest concern, there are a lot of unbalanced people out there, and all of a sudden, I'm the CIA poster girl, and our home in Washington, the front door was about 20 feet from the street. I went to the agency at a certain point and asked for security on a residence.","Of course, when you're a parent, that's your paramount concern, for your children, and there were some very credible and frightening threats, and the agency declined to provide any security, and it felt like a betrayal all over again. It was really painful.","Regarding Wikileaks, I have profound ambivalent feelings about it. I am a firm believer in a strong intelligence service. There's a need for classified information.","We've made some good beginnings with the New START Treaty, but a lot more can be done.","We in no way are naive to think that just because Russia and the United States agree to reduce their arsenals, that everyone else will fall in line.","North Korea is the errant teenage child, aren't they? Or toddler - they're holding their breath until they get their way.","There's no way you can possibly intellectually justify, 'Well, it's okay for the Western Judeo-Christian countries to have nuclear weapons, but not for a country like Iran.' That logic goes nowhere fast.","Certainly, if we had not invaded Iraq on intelligence that was clearly manipulated and cherry picked, we would be in a different position today.","There is no question that what we are seeing - the horrible advance of ISIS - goes back, if you will, to the original sin of the invasion of Iraq.","I think the Bush Administration was bound and determined on regime change, and we will be paying the price of that for some time to come.","A chief of station is the head of all intelligence operations in any given country.","For me, I thought I had the best job in the world.","Any time you're a poster child for the CIA, there are a lot of people that are - either have ideological or they are mentally unbalanced - that are going to try to find you and perhaps cause you harm.","I come from a family in which public service was something to aspire to.","My father was an air officer in the Second World War. My brother was a marine in Vietnam. When I was given this opportunity, I leapt at the chance because I thought it would be a hell of a lot more interesting than what my friends were doing.","In the CIA, they recruit you to be an officer, an ops officer, in part due to how well you cope with stress and how well you adapt to new situations.","When I was happily married and found myself pregnant, I just thought that this would be just the next, normal chapter. I was absolutely thrilled. So what a surprise it was when it turned out to be the hardest thing I've ever done.","Donald Trump has done a lot of horrible things on Twitter. From emboldening white supremacists to promoting violence against journalists, his tweets damage the country and put people in harm's way.","I think it's the height of patriotism to continue to exercise your right as a citizen and to hold your government to account. Isn't that what the very essence of democracy is about?","It's some weird idea to think that you've always got to say everything is great and perfect.","We need the best and the brightest to go into public service.","Joe and I are still very aware of the fact that we live in a country where he criticised the government and lived another day. That trumps all. To paraphrase Churchill, democracy is the worst form of government apart from all the other forms of government. You constantly have to fight for it; you have to keep your government honest.","We have known Hillary Clinton both professionally and personally for close to 20 years, dating back to before President Bill Clinton's first trip to Africa in 1998 - a trip that they both acknowledge changed their lives and gave considerable meaning to their post-White House years and to the activities of the Clinton Foundation.","When we were subjected to a vicious character assassination campaign orchestrated by senior White House officials and championed by their allies in the right-wing echo chamber, Hillary reached out to us. Her counsel during that tumultuous period was as timely as it was wise.","After President Obama's election in 2008, there was a widespread hope that it would mark an end to unseemly partisan nastiness.","Hillary stood with us, as she has stood with so many over the years, and we are proud to stand with her for our country now.","I'm not terribly confrontational, but I've gotten better at holding my ground.","I want to shine a spotlight on showing how dangerous Trump and his Twitter button can be.","After I resigned, I could eventually speak for myself, but when it first happened, I was in complete shock, and it took a long time for me to overcome it.","She was very kind to us when Joe and I went through the darkest days of the leak of my name in 2003. And, of course, Joe worked in the Clinton White House.","Even those that hate Hillary admit she is a work horse and not a show horse. She gets down into the nuts and bolts and figures out, 'What's the policy, what's the substance?'","So many times, genuine health workers and genuine NGO folks are really just trying to help other humans in whatever capacity they can. But they are perceived as being CIA, and therefore, it blocks their effectiveness.","In many, many parts of the world, being a female, you're really just wallpaper. If you take care to blend in, no one would think in a thousand years that you were doing anything suspicious.","I know having a Jason Bourne all alone in a field firing at bad guys is much more dramatic, but it's not real.","Of course, we all watch James Bond with envy - knowing the U.S. government would never pay for the lifestyle he enjoys.","I didn't appreciate how special and sometimes strange my CIA world was - until it suddenly and spectacularly ended in a newspaper column.","One characteristic that I hope I never relinquish is an intense curiosity about the world around me.","Over the years, from serving in the CIA to sitting on non-profit boards, I have observed first-hand what the addition of even one woman to a meeting or to a decision-making body can do. Put simply, in very many instances, group dynamics improve markedly.","I first learned the power of trust in the CIA. There is no question that when I joined the Agency as a covert operations officer, it was still run along the 'old boys' network' model.","The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which in 1996 set out to ban nuclear tests, is an important step, but we need to do more - and we can.","According to the 2000 'Report of the U.N. Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation,' the long-lasting effects of nuclear testing can be qualified in simple scientific terms: 'Radiation exposure can damage living cells, causing death in some of them and modifying others.'"],"Valerie Simpson":["You know, we have two families: the one we're born into, and the one that we make for ourselves afterwards.","Motown was the mecca. It was every writer's dream to work there.","I was a good sight reader and I could sing two or three of these jingles a day. An orchestra would come in for half an hour, and then the singers would come in and knock 'em out, and go on to the next one. I was the voice of Budweiser and Almond Joy.","There is a formula that allows you to write a decent song. But a song like 'You're All I Need to Get By,' it just writes itself.","Both my grandmothers had upright pianos, and I just knew how to play since I was a child. Nobody taught me. I sounded like a grown-up, and then I learned how to read music. I played so well by ear I could fool the teacher to believe I could play the notes. She'd make the mistake of playing the song once, and I could play it.","And it's a lot harder to hide with four musicians than it is with eight.","It's a songwriter's dream to have a song recorded and run up the charts.","I don't know what I want to do. There are people who want me to do things. There's a possible book. There are lots of things to consider. I just have to figure out what I want to do. I'm not one to sit around and do nothing.","In transition I think the spirit goes somewhere, but I don't think it leaves.","When you're a producer and an artist you're very critical of yourself. I like to produce other people, but I'm not that good at producing myself.","I guess I'm in a state of becoming. Even though I've had a full career and I've been around a long time, it's like dinosaurs are coming back. It's all new. I'm having to be on my own and seeing how exciting life can be now.","Nobody in my family was musical. I had no idea you could be a songwriter and make a living at it. It was all discovery. It was all just thrown at me.","My daughters are here, and that makes me feel good. And with the spirit of Nick Ashford, I think I'll make it through. I have no choice.","I've already lived one full life, and so now I'm about to endeavor to see what else the good Lord has in store for me, and I'm wide open.","It's interesting when you've been a partner with someone for so long. So now to sing solo and starting all over again I am learning that I am more bodacious than I thought. I don't know where it's coming from but I am glad.","Sometimes you want a Part Two in your life.","We stand on our songs and we stand on the songs that we wrote for other people. That gives us a higher platform.","We have been playing to a 70-30 black to white audience. And we are just doing what should come next, trying to attract a larger house, trying to reach an audience that's half black and white.","In the future I think the labels on most pop music are going to go. Everyone keeps jumping into everyone else's space."],"Valerie Solanas":["Our society is not a community, but merely a collection of isolated family units."],"Valerie Trierweiler":["In France, a first lady has no status, and therefore she isn't supposed to do anything else.","My perception of life is not to ask Francois Hollande, who isn't the father of my children, to support me financially.","I've shared the fate of many working mothers; I felt guilty like them.","I built my entire life on the idea of independence.","My feeling is that maintaining financial independence is also a healthy way to keep my feet on the ground.","I have never worn dresses by grands couturiers.","I'm not Cinderella.","I am, and remain, passionate about news.","I know politics; I know the media.","I will count to 10 before tweeting.","Being First Lady is playing supporting act. I am not seeking notoriety and I am not seeking to grab the limelight.","These days, everything is magnified very quickly by the media - the slightest slip can turn into a catastrophe.","I am a committed observer. I like staying in the background and seeing what's going on."],"Valorie Curry":["I love the horror genre and the thriller genre, so I've got no problem with playing a psycho.","If you're going to play a villain, there's no greater compliment than being told that you give people nightmares. I never thought I would be the actor that would give people nightmares.","I grew up performing in theatre.","My mother was working on her college degree throughout my childhood, and being the youngest in the family, that meant being dragged to a lot of her classes. She majored in playwriting, so I was exposed to theatre from a very young age, and it was just the most magical world to me.","The characters that aren't what they seem to be or women who are stronger than people give them credit for or characters you underestimate, I always think are really interesting because there are so many possibilities with them.","Being on 'The Following' is constantly flying by the seat of my pants. The story can change and the character can change at a moment's notice.","My mother was working on her college degree throughout my childhood, and being the youngest in the family, that meant being dragged to a lot of her classes. She majored in playwriting, so I was exposed to theatre from a very young age, and it was just the most magical world to me. I never really wanted to do anything else.","If we had a party every time someone died on 'The Following,' we'd never get anything done.","I'm a New Yorker. My background is in theater, so staying here, I have the opportunity to get back to that, which I would love to do."],"Van Cliburn":["I'm not a success, I'm a sensation.","An artist can be truly evaluated only after he is dead. At the very 11th hour, he might do something that will eclipse everything else."],"Van Jones":["I cannot in good conscience ask my colleagues to expend precious time and energy defending or explaining my past. We need all hands on deck, fighting for the future.","You've never seen a Columbine done by a black child. Never. They always say, 'We can't believe it happened here. We can't believe it's these suburban white kids.' It's only them!","Let me say what I actually believe. I believe that 9/11 was a conspiracy, by Al Qaeda, and Osama Bin Laden, and no one else trying to hurt America."],"Van Morrison":["There is no black-and-white situation. It's all part of life. Highs, lows, middles.","In order to win you must be prepared to lose sometime. And leave one or two cards showing.","You learn to read the audiences after a while, and there are all different kinds of gigs.","Hearing the blues changed my life.","If it's what you do and you can do it, then you do it.","Music is spiritual. The music business is not.","A lot of people who were writing when I came through originally as a singer-songwriter have disappeared.","There's always got to be a struggle. What else is there? That's what life is made of. I don't know anything else. If there is, tell me about it.","I just need somewhere to dump all my negativity.","The future is keeping you out of the present time.","I'd love to live in Ireland but I'd like to live as me, not what someone thinks I am. People don't understand - I lived there before I was famous.","What you see is what you get.","You've got to separate the singer and the songs.","If you're a pop singer, you don't need to evolve. You just get a set together, have some hit songs and play them over and over.","I've never felt like I was born with a silver spoon at all, although I've felt like howling at the moon a lot of times!","I went back to Belfast and started a club, the Maritime. No one had thought about doing a blues club, so I was the first.","I think Paul McGuinness and U2 created the Irish music industry. It certainly wasn't there before that.","I don't think nostalgia has to be negative.","Every performance is different. That's the beauty of it.","I write songs. Then, I record them. And, later, maybe I perform them on stage. That's what I do. That's my job. Simple.","Large audiences did not suit my low-key approach.","You take stuff from different places, and sometimes you stick a line in because it rhymes, not because it makes sense.","You can't stay the same. If you're a musician and a singer, you have to change, that's the way it works.","When I started you were more in touch with the people you were playing to. There wasn't the distance or the separation that there is now.","When I started studying tenor saxophone as a kid in Belfast, I did so with a guy named George Cassidy, who was also a big inspiration.","These days politics, religion, media seem to get all mixed up. Television became the new religion a long time back and the media has taken over.","The point of jazz is, you do something and then you go on.","The first piece of music that captured my imagination was probably Ray Charles Live At Newport.","Skiffle was a name that was attached to what was, in essence, American folk music with a beat.","My ambition when I started out was to play two or three gigs a week. And that's what I'm doing.","It was really strange for me when I started to play concerts in America where the audiences were all sitting down.","I'm very lucky, I'm happy with life because my experiences led me to do what I had to do. I don't have any regrets whatsoever.","I'm not a rock singer and I don't want to be a rock singer. I'm not interested. It doesn't seem to get across.","I understood jazz, I understood how it worked. That's what I apply to everything.","I never paid attention to what was contemporary or what was commercial, it didn't mean anything to me.","I never bought the commercial thing, at any stage of the game.","I learnt from Armstrong on the early recordings that you never sang a song the same way twice.","I educated myself. To me, school was boring.","I do see value in music criticism. Most of the criticism I have received over the years has been very good.","I always record far more than I can use. There's probably twice as much recorded as comes out.","Even today, skiffle is a defining part of my music. If I get the opportunity to just have a jam, skiffle is what I love to play.","As a developing musician, skiffle became a platform for me to start playing music.","A famous person to themselves, they don't get up in the morning and think, I'm famous. I'm not famous to me. Famous is a perception.","Being famous was extremely disappointing for me. When I became famous it was a complete drag and it is still a complete drag.","I don't feel comfortable doing interviews. My profession is music, and writing songs. That's what I do. I like to do it, but I hate to talk about it.","Singing is my profession - there is no plan B.","For a long time, I couldn't actually deal with playing concerts; it was a totally alien concept to me, 'cause I was used to playing in clubs and dance halls.","My thinking musically has always been more advanced - it is difficult to get it down onto paper sometimes, even now.","I put out records to this day that are not necessarily in a sequence of anything. Some could be written a while back, some not. There is no set pattern.","My records do not require a lot of thought of 'What is this?' and 'What is that?' That would be too contrived for me.","I am about the arrangements and the layers of depth in the music.","I think when you get past your second album, it all becomes something of a routine. So you have to struggle against that, find a way of making what you do sound fresh and new each time.","I deliberately try not to cater for the commercial market, so I can't see myself in competition, you know, with second or third generation rock stars."],"Van Wyck Brooks":["Genius and virtue are to be more often found clothed in gray than in peacock bright.","Magnanimous people have no vanity, they have no jealousy, and they feed on the true and the solid wherever they find it. And, what is more, they find it everywhere.","The creative impulses of man are always at war with the possessive impulses.","The man who has the courage of his platitudes is always a successful man.","People of small caliber are always carping. They are bent on showing their own superiority, their knowledge or prowess or good breeding.","Nothing is sadder than having worldly standards without worldly means.","No one is fit to judge a book until he has rounded Cape Horn in a sailing vessel, until he has bumped into two or three icebergs, until he has been lost in the sands of the desert, until he has spent a few years in the House of the Dead.","It is not that the French are not profound, but they all express themselves so well that we are led to take their geese for swans.","If men were basically evil, who would bother to improve the world instead of giving it up as a bad job at the outset?","The American mind, unlike the English, is not formed by books, but, as Carl Sandburg once said to me... by newspapers and the Bible.","There is no stopping the world's tendency to throw off imposed restraints, the religious authority that is based on the ignorance of the many, the political authority that is based on the knowledge of the few."],"Vance Havner":["The vision must be followed by the venture. It is not enough to stare up the steps - we must step up the stairs.","It is one of the ironies of the ministry that the very man who works in God's name is often hardest put to find time for God. The parents of Jesus lost Him at church, and they were not the last ones to lose Him there.","Too many church services start at eleven sharp and end at twelve dull.","Many people are in a rut and a rut is nothing but a grave - with both ends kicked out.","Sometimes your medicine bottle has on it, 'Shake well before using.' That is what God has to do with some of His people. He has to shake them well before they are ever usable.","The devil will let a preacher prepare a sermon if it will keep him from preparing himself.","I'm tired of hearing sin called sickness and alcoholism a disease. It is the only disease I know of that we're spending hundreds of millions of dollars a year to spread.","You haven't lost anything when you know were it is. Death can hide but not divide.","It would not be better if things happened to men just as they wish.","Doing leads more surely to talking than talking to doing.","If they had a social gospel in the days of the prodigal son, somebody would have given him a bed and a sandwich and he never would have gone home."],"Vance Joy":["Sometimes when you're writing a song and that song comes into your head, it definitely comes from somewhere, like a real experience.","I really honestly can't see myself as a lawyer. It's pretty much safe to say I'll never become one.","I'm a folk singer-songwriter. I am pretty poppy though.","I'm definitely not a super great guitarist. Ultimately, I just write a lot of love songs.","I like to get suggestions on what to read. I'll look at Twitter, people I like, people I admire... I'll go and research the book, download it on my phone and read it while I'm on the road.","I just got a band together in mid-2012, and we played our first show in October of that year.","Ralph Fiennes and Edward Norton are among my favorite actors.","The fact I even get an opportunity to make one album is crazy. But if all goes to plan, I'll get to make five albums. That'd be nice.","It's a weird thing to say you want people to be sick of your song, but I guess that's what happens if your song goes really well.","I wasn't completely comfortable in the footy culture because I wasn't that comfortable in my own skin, which I am now. I'd fit in better now, but I don't miss the training and the injuries you get playing footy.","I feel like I'd have a different approach to football now after doing music.","When I go to a gig and I hear a song that I really like, a song that hits home to me or hits an emotional nerve, if I could ever recreate that for someone, that would be the ultimate goal."],"Vance McAllister":["I've failed those I care most about and let down the people who elected me to represent them.","We have Sunday morning breakfast before church. I don't do the dishes, but I do cook. I'm the griller.","I want everybody to know I'm approachable. I'm a true conservative, but I'm an American first.","Whether you're a Democrat or Republican, I want everyone to know that I'm here. We'll talk; we'll visit.","I had an entrepreneurial spirit and started branching out from there.","I'm lucky to have been blessed with a great family and a wonderful Christian wife.","The people of the Fifth District of Louisiana need and deserve a voice in Washington.","If you will trust me with your vote, you can count on me to take those values to Washington.","Nowhere in the Bible did anyone bring back anyone's past sins and throw them in their face.","Trust is something I know has to be earned whether you're a husband, a father, or a congressman.","From day one, I've always tried to be an honest man. I ran for Congress to make a difference and not to just be another politician.","For future politics, I don't know what it holds, but if there's a possibility that the people want me to do another political office, again, maybe I'll do it.","If what I went through on a national level, the trouble between me and my wife, if it helps one couple going through the same thing... if it saves one family, it's worth it.","I've stayed focused on the job at hand representing the people of the 5th district... a voice for everyone rich or poor or male or female.","I'd never rule anything out, to be honest with you, whether it be the small of volunteer status for a community organization or national politics, who knows?","I promise to do everything I can to earn back the trust of everyone I've disappointed."],"Vance Packard":["Rock and roll might be summed up as monotony tinged with hysteria.","You can't tell a millionaire's son from a billionaire's.","The difference between a top-flight creative man and the hack is his ability to express powerful meanings indirectly.","Leadership appears to be the art of getting others to want to do something you are convinced should be done.","The Christian notion of the possibility of redemption is incomprehensible to the computer."],"Vanessa Bayer":["I sleep a lot on Sunday. It's really great.","It's like, backstage at 'SNL,' like, if you come back after a show or something, or a lot of times even at the after-parties, we're just pretty tired and like, 'Hey, what's up.' Just getting a drink and kind of chilling out. Nothing crazy.","It's totally my dream job. I grew up watching 'Saturday Night Live.' We'd watch it at sleepover parties and quote it.","I had been on this improv team at this really great improv theater. It's called iO now. It used to be called Improv Olympic. They have showcases for Lorne Michaels and other writers and people who work at 'SNL' usually about once a year, although I don't know if it always happens.","There are just so many funny kids and teenagers. They're just not aware of how funny they are.","I've been watching a lot of A&E's 'Intervention.' I know that's sort of depressing, but I love watching it.","The town I grew up in was at least fifty percent Jewish, so every weekend in the 7th grade, we went to Bar and Bat Mitzvahs.","My dad is a really funny guy, and we would make jokes about my leukemia. When my friends would come over, we would joke about it, too.","Being sick is the reason I went into comedy.","It's so funny: at 'SNL,' Bill Hader always kind of treated me like his little sister and would kind of, like, lovingly bully me.","I do think that the audience thinks it's funny when you break, but if you do it all the time, it loses something.","With 'Trainwreck,' because it wasn't live and we could do more takes, I feel like we broke a lot.","My fridge is usually pretty empty. If I can get it together to order FreshDirect, I will have some fruit and yogurt in the fridge. But there isn't a ton of stuff you would cook with.","People think New York is crazy and busy, but it's actually a great place for lazy people to live.","I usually meditate twice a day: Transcendental Meditation.","I can stay up watching TV so late.","I felt that it was cool to even get to the point where I was able to audition on the actual 'SNL' stage. Looking back on it, I can't believe that I wasn't more nervous.","I'm not totally sure what I want to be doing, but it's so fun to be on 'SNL' because you get exposed to so many different people and so many different experiences. It's a cool, lucky way to break into the business.","Every sketch goes through a rewrite stage where a group of writers sits around a table and pitches more jokes and ideas for the piece.","I've had some pretty rough interviews. And it's funny when people are interviewing you, and they sort of don't really understand what you do, and they kind of insult you.","I went to this one in Ohio, and then I became a counselor there, and it was just the most fun thing. I was so depressed when I came home from camp.","As a child or young adult going through an illness, it can be stressful at times and boring and extremely alienating.","There always have been funny women.","You feel like you need to deal with a lot if you're from Cleveland, so you learn to let things roll off your back, and you learn that humor is the best way to deal with it.","Cleveland gets crapped on a lot.","To be honest, I don't even exactly know how to set up a Google alert. My brother has me on Google alert. So do my parents. But I'm not even sure how it works.","The longer you're on a show like 'SNL,' the less frequent the Google alerts become.","That was a huge part of my training, doing improv in Chicago."],"Vanessa Brown":["I actually write film music because I'm classically trained on the piano so as well as songwriting I also write actual film music that could be used for movies like war movies and love movies.","So film music is something I absolutely wanna get involved in.","I mean if I'm in the middle of a field with my keyboard and some headphones and I feel inspired to write something, I'll just write something really beautiful and mellow.","I think it's so important to feed your brain you know. Sometimes you've just got to read.","The thing about being in America is when you are driving with the sun on your back, there's hip hop. I never used to be into hip hop, but there's hip hop in the food, soul food, there's hip hop in the cars."],"Vanessa Carlton":["Toting around a full orchestra on tour is very ambitious. I would consider doing a show now and then, like do a show at Radio City or Carnegie Hall with a full orchestra.","Food can become such a point of anxiety - not because it's food, but just because you have anxiety. That's how eating disorders develop.","Now, performing is second nature and I love every second of it. It is a very emotional thing when I can't play a song; maybe I'm hitting on something that I don't want to deal with. All of it is so personal. It is like therapy.","A lot of people give in to those pressures and let others influence the process on their second albums because they want to achieve the success they had with their first again, but they don't know how to do it.","And it's sad because it's like a surprise to people - almost an anomaly - when artists are actually refined and trained on an instrument. That's the last thing people think about.","But my mom was a pianist, and she taught piano out of her house. I was just so excited, being a little kid and having all these other kids come to my house twice a week. I thought it was a big party.","But now - look, I have to take care of myself. I work out every day. I'm a dancer. I've always been an athlete, and I'm one of those people who start to go crazy if they don't run or do something.","But the approach to recording this album was kind of an organized, chaotic approach where I wanted to maintain and preserve that wild abandon to creating.","But when you hear the complete album, it gets dark, really straight-up rock, with some really intimate moments with just me and the piano. It's not completely me because there are parts of me that aren't on that song, that are on the album.","Every single note on this album is there for a reason.","I am always drawn to men that are funny. I do not know why. But I am always drawn to people that are struggling with parts of themselves... But it's like in the end, there has to be confidence.","I am not this big celebrity, but it gets really crazy. You have to go through the nuts of blowing up, in a sense, and then figuring out how to live your life with that.","I did not stop dancing; I did take two years off to get myself together.","I don't put boundaries on myself when I sit at the piano.","I don't use sex to sell records, obviously, but I'd be lying if I said that I don't feel like I have to make an effort to look good when I go out onstage, to wear something pretty.","I had no album title, and the album is like a journey in that it's a complete body of work. It's not just a couple of catchy songs and filler, so I felt that I needed to capture the essence of the album.","I have gone from being a 21-year-old with wide eyes to a 24-year-old woman. With success comes a lot of responsibility and power.","I learned a lot from that first record and I learned a lot from my experiences touring, but really the biggest education I got over the past two years was learning the importance of arrangements.","I tour with a piano, actually. Luckily I am able to hire people that deal with it completely and magically a piano appears on stage and then magically disappears when I leave.","I work hard and I will always work hard. But I feel very lucky with the way that it has all come together.","If Mozart were around now he would write a killer rock song.","My mom would give me a piece to play, but I wouldn't do any theory because when it came time to do it I would sneak back upstairs and watch TV. So, I had these kind of nonchalant lessons for years, then it just started soaking in.","My songs are a direct route into my brain and my heart.","Plus, there were so many pianos in my house, so I couldn't really avoid it.","The music industry is so easy compared to the ballet world.","The women who don't feel that people think they're sexy are the ones who seem to titillate in that way, because they don't feel like they're getting that kind of approval.","Well, I would say that music just happens with me, I'm not in the driver's seat when I am at the piano, the piano is.","When it comes to music, we live in a very different world than everyone did in the 1960s and 1970s.","Writing this record let me recapture who I am. It is summed up in the title Be Not Nobody. You need to feel comfortable in your skin and do whatever you need to do for yourself, to heal or to grow."],"Vanessa Diffenbaugh":["The Victorian language of flowers began with the publication of 'Le Language des Fleurs,' written by Charlotte de Latour and printed in Paris in 1819. To create the book - which was a list of flowers and their meanings - de Latour gathered references to flower symbolism throughout poetry, ancient mythology, and even medicine.","There's still something so pure and heartfelt and emotional and genuine about a bouquet of flowers that, even with all the advances of technology and the millions of ways we have to communicate with each other, flowers are still relevant in my opinion.","Our standards for motherhood are so high that many of us harbor intense, secret guilt for every harsh word we speak to our children, every negative thought that enters our minds.","You have to really prove yourself to young people, and if your answer is clear and consistent and loving - even if it's angry and disappointed - what's important is that you're being real and honest and not going anywhere.","We all make mistakes, and we all need second chances. For youth in foster care, these mistakes are often purposeful - if not consciously so; a way to test the strength of a bond and establish trust in a new parent.","My husband was working as principal of an urban transformation high school - the kind of public charter school determined to do whatever it takes to give its mostly minority, low-income student body the education they need and deserve to be successful in life.","I've worked with homeless kids, kids in foster care, and I've never met a kid who couldn't be reached.","Though politics is by nature divisive, surely we all can agree that foster children need stability, safety, education, opportunity - and love.","I'm missing work. We didn't have enough money for preschool. I had a panic attack. I couldn't do it. I became one of those horrible foster parents who give the kids back.","We are more and more into technology. Everything is texting, and everything is instant. Flowers are completely impractical as a method of communication when you could just send a text.","The problem is foster youth don't really have this network that other kids have.","I was a screenwriting and studio art major in college, so even though I don't have any training as a floral designer, I have a very particular visual aesthetic.","I don't think there is anything magical about the language of flowers in real life or in my book.","I founded Camellia Network with my dear friend Isis Dallis Keigwin. The mission of our organization is to create a national network that connects every youth aging out of foster care to the critical resources, opportunities, and support they need to thrive in adulthood.","At Camellia Network, we believe if we can create a way of identifying every young person aging out of foster care, defining what they need, and giving a community of supporters a simple and clear way to fulfill those needs, we can produce radically improved outcomes for youth.","My last book, 'The Language of Flowers,' I wrote completely on naptime, when my little kids were asleep.","First drafts are never any good - at least, mine aren't.","I think that the hardest thing about working with young people in foster care who've been through this kind of neglect and abuse is really to convince them that they are worthy of being loved. And I think because often they don't feel worthy of it, that's why they push people away.","I'm very interested in getting inside the heads of people society discards, people on the fringe, especially immigrant kids. We dismiss them without getting into details of who they are.","I've always loved the language of flowers. I discovered Kate Greenaway's 'Language of Flowers' in a used bookstore when I was 16 and couldn't believe it was such a well-kept secret. How could something so beautiful and romantic be virtually unknown?","I traveled a full two years with 'Language of Flowers.'","There's a certain freedom in writing when you don't know if you'll ever have an audience.","The most violent and troubling stories become part of our national consciousness about foster care.","We were pressured to accept kids we were not qualified to handle. And we do that to people all the time, which is why we don't have enough foster parents.","Writing has always been an interest of mine, and 'The Language of Flowers' combined my experience with foster care with something I've always wanted to do.","I have spent a lot of time with foster children over the years - kids for whom I have not necessarily acted as a foster parent.","As a college student, I worked as a mentor, and that got me involved in working with young people long before I became a foster parent.","I never really considered writing something that was nonfiction.","My husband and I have been involved with foster youth since our early 20s. Right out of college and not yet married, we spent weekends mentoring a family of young girls.","My husband and I vowed that after we married and settled down, we would become foster parents - a vow we kept and one that has enriched our lives greatly.","We have been trained to broadcast our successes and hide our failures. But the truth is this: our failures humanise us, and they connect us to one another.","I am not only the person who wrote and sold a novel while raising a houseful of biological and foster children; I am also the person who wrote a horrific young adult novel that never sold and gave up on a foster child I couldn't handle - an experience that still haunts me.","It is stories - both real and fictional - that can captivate hearts, change minds and, in the most powerful examples, spur action.","We can become anyone we want to become. It takes focusing on the aspect of ourselves we want to change and reflecting on the beliefs that cause us to act in ways that are counter to the change we seek.","Every second I have spare, I'm with my kids.","I did a minor in creative writing in college, but I didn't start writing until I stayed at home with my own children.","I love Toni Morrison and Jeanette Winterson. 'The Passion' is my favourite book.","I wanted to write with emotional honesty and tell a story people could connect with. And I wanted people to know how the foster system in America fails children; and how, at 18, they fall through the cracks. Then we can all work together and give support.","The names of common flowers change from decade to decade, so I spent a lot of time with old outdated dictionaries, with awful flower names like 'mouse-eared chickweed.'","There aren't always, especially in low-income communities, the arts and the dance and the drama and the things that can really show a kid, 'Look, even if I'm three years behind in math, there's something I'm good at that can help me be successful in life.'","Everyone needs something they're good at. You want your kids to be passionate and figure out something they're good at."],"Vanessa Ferlito":["The first thing I went out for was 'The Sopranos' and I got it, so that's how it happened. I hate to say it like that because I wait for calls now.","You know, I still live in my neighborhood. I live in Brooklyn and the same neighborhood, so I don't really get star treatment like that. I'm still Vanessa from the neighborhood.","I always get scared. I can't read scripts. I'm scared, scary movies and stuff.","I was a club kid. I was on the cover of 'New York' magazine and discovered like that.","I torture my mother with all my problems, that poor woman.","I'm still Vanessa from the neighborhood. My parents own the shop, and I'm there all the time, that I worked in when I was a teenager. I have a child from my childhood sweetheart.","The funny thing is I'm not even Latin. I was constantly getting Latin roles, and I was like, I even was nominated for an award, and I was like, 'Let them know at the NAACP, the first white woman. Let them know I'm totally grateful, but I'm not Latin. I can't do that. I play Latin.'","I have to be honest - I don't love guns.","I do yoga; I'm pretty dedicated.","Quentin Tarantino is a genius. I want to do every single film with him.","Kurt Russell is so dreamy. Plus, he's great to work with, really respectful.","You have to really love women in order to really just have a respect for women and love them. No man - I don't care what kind of man it is, how feminine he is - they never could understand what we go through as far as physically and mentally.","New York's my home. Born and raised. I'm a New Yorker to the bone."],"Vanessa Ferrari":["I'd say I'm quite powerful so I'm not afraid of jumps or acrobatic elements. The hardest part is... get on the beam and stay there on top of it!","The Ferrari is a beautiful car. It's great.","I'd like to go out with friends, but I train twice a day, then I go to school, and at night I go home."],"Vanessa Hudgens":["Being cool is being your own self, not doing something that someone else is telling you to do.","So many people try to grow up too fast, and it's not fun! You should stay a kid as long as possible!","I don't like being stagnant. I want to continue to grow and just be better at what I do, and the only way to do that is to keep stepping outside of your comfort zone.","You have to be able to love yourself because that's when things fall into place.","My first real kiss came when I was 10, and it was in an acting class. I had to do a scene from a movie where someone gets kissed under a tree, and I did not want to do it! But my acting partner wanted me to feel comfortable, so he bought a picnic basket with all these snacks. He made such an effort - and it was cute.","I don't go long without eating. I never starve myself: I grab a healthy snack.","Exercise is amazing, from the inside out. I feel so alive and have more energy.","Power to the peaceful.","Long-distance relationships are hard no matter what. When you don't have face-to-face time, it's just different.","I just love expanding my horizons and growing as an artist. The only way you get to do that is by doing something that scares you or takes you out of your comfort zone.","It's just about keeping people who are close to me, near. It's important to have people around who love themselves, are true to themselves, who have their own hobbies and their world doesn't revolve around Hollywood.","I'm really an outdoorsy girl. People think I can't go anywhere without getting all primped up, but I love to go camping, and I'm totally fine with not doing my hair or makeup, not taking a shower and just hiking.","I try not to read the blogs or what people say about me. Because that's what brings everybody down - no matter what you do, you're always going to have haters.","I love funky styles. Not preppy or rock, just funky!","I feel like a lot of people think of Hollywood as being fake, but it's only perceived that way because it takes 10 people to make someone look the way that they do. In reality, they're there because they are doing what they're passionate about.","Confidence is key. Sometimes, you need to look like you're confident even when you're not.","I get to go to all these beautiful places, so it's nice being able to take pictures of it.","Touring is tough. You're almost in a haze because you don't really know where you are half the time: You're in a hotel room one moment, and the next thing you know, you're onstage performing for 60,000 people, then you're back on an airplane. It's very hectic and I couldn't do it without my family.","I love finding things that scare me and doing them. That's how you grow.","My advice to kids is give it your all! Give it 110 percent and don't give up!","This is going to sound really funny. I have a poster of Zac Efron on my wall! I think every girl has a poster of him in their room so, why not join the club!","I love and really respect strong women. I'm obsessed with Scarlett Johansson and Drew Barrymore and Penelope Cruz. They are just really incredibly strong-willed, intelligent females in the industry.","I am human like everyone else. I am aware that there are people who look up to me. When mistakes are made, they aren't intentional, and I constantly push myself to be a better person.","You have a choice whether you want to be happy or not. I choose to be happy.","I have a toy poodle, Shadow. She's a little whippersnapper! And I love little monkeys.","Do not just look at your boyfriend as just a boyfriend. Look at him as a friend, too.","The second I met Zac, I thought he was a really cool guy. It's hard not to have chemistry with someone who is so attractive.","Once I turned 13, I was the guy magnet.","The Lion King always makes me cry, especially when Simba's father gets trampled.","I want to try doing sportier things, kite surfing and paddle surfing - I think it would give me that extra confidence.","Ghost stories really scare me. I have such a big imagination that after I watch a horror movie like 'The Grudge', I look in the corners of my room for the next two days.","Guys act strange around me. I swear I don't know why!","I have three closets in my bedroom.","I just lip gloss! It doesn't matter if it's $2 or $30.","I like friends who are honest and loyal. They also shouldn't be afraid to be a kid. I like having fun.","I like someone who's not afraid to be a kid!","I may have had a crush on Zac, but we are like brother and sister, so nothing would ever happen.","I think I'd make a pretty good girlfriend.","I want to let my fans get to know a little about me. I'm very thankful for everything they've done for me so, of course, I'm going to let them into my world a bit. But I really am a very private person, and I love kepping my life to myself - that's how I've always been.","I'd like to win an Oscar.","I'm not very experienced with boys or the whole dating thingy.","I've always had problems with guys!","I've always wanted to play Maria in West Side Story. My idol is Natalie Wood, and I love the movie, so I think a modern-day twist on it would be really neat.","I've had many nicknames over the years: V, Nessa, Nessy Poo, Nessy Bear and Van. Only my parents call me Van, though, and I hate it. I get embarrassed.","If people don't like me for whatever I do, for being me, then that's too bad. I don't want to change to be something that I'm not for other people to like me.","If you have your eye set on somebody, don't beat around the bush.","Lipgloss is my calling!","My passion is doing movies, and as long as I keep doing that, I'll be happy. I want to do movies, fun roles and dramatic ones. I love all of it.","My passion is doing movies, so as long as I keep doing that I will be happy.","Right now, I do not like kids at all. I mean, I love my fans and everything, but when you have kids following you around all day, it's like, 'Ugh, kids!' Maybe that will change when I get older.","The sweetest thing a guy said is that I look pretty with or without makeup.","I feel like I've been fortunate enough that I've gotten to meet and work with some really passionate people.","Good boys are nice - don't go for the bad ones!","A good amount of the guys wanted to date me. Even older guys looking at me. It took some getting used to.","I was so unhealthy. I used to go to 'Cold Stone Creamery,' get a tub of Butterfinger ice cream, and eat it all before bedtime. And my fingers were permanently stained orange from Cheetos.","I like egg white omelets with veggies, or oatmeal with almonds and fruit.","When you're putting good stuff into your body, you feel so much better.","My style is boho chic. I love that time period - the patterns, the prints, the people, the music, the vibe.","I'm not good with catty girls. I'm too laid-back.","I'm becoming more adventurous.","When I was younger, I used to be super, super shy. I still find myself being scared of things.","I want to go to Morocco really bad.","I feel like acting is something I've been working towards longer. And it would be great to win a Grammy, of course, but for some reason, an Oscar speaks more to me.","I love Cameron Diaz, and I love Drew Barrymore.","I really do try to watch everything I say. Because one little tiny slip, and it's like the world is coming to an end!","I try to live my life, do what I want, and just let everything else follow along.","I do always have a wall up. But I feel by doing it, I keep myself safe.","I love children. They're so much fun and I would have a blast spoiling them.","I hope by the time I'm 30 to have a husband and maybe a baby.","My mum and I do cardio kickboxing classes together.","If you're always worried about being on your phone, then you really are missing out on everything that's happening in front of you.","That's actually how my parents met. They were pen pals. My mom was in the Philippines and my father was in the States, and they wrote to each other. He went out to meet her, and they wed not too long after.","It's important to have people around who love themselves, are true to themselves, who have their own hobbies and their world doesn't revolve around Hollywood. I can always go to my family with any doubts or questions I may have.","My heart is closer to acting than singing. It's always been that way.","I try to not read about myself. I think it's easier to have it out of sight and out of mind.","I had a gypsy upbringing, so I moved around all over the place and can't remember a street I grew up on.","Violence has been a part of films since the beginning of time. It's been a form of entertainment.","I did ask Matt Damon for his autograph - and I got a picture, too!","I had my first real kiss at Magic Mountain on a park bench. Not the most romantic thing ever.","I always used to watch 'Labyrinth' and 'The Neverending Story.' Those were like my two favorite movies that I would watch over and over and over again.","I love doing theater. That's where my home is.","I used to go to Cold Stone Creamery, get a tub of Butterfinger ice cream, and eat it all before bedtime. And my fingers were permanently stained orange from Cheetos."],"Vanessa Kerry":["But one of the things I learned is that when you fight for something you believe in and you tell the truth and you do your best, you can always hold your head up high and no one can take that away from you.","The dinner table is a lively debate, and everybody weighs in in a different way. I like that, though.","I think there is a generation gap. I personally look forward to, as our generation becomes the leaders, you are gonna see a change, and I think hopefully gay marriage will be a part of that country.","I just learned not to take a single thing for granted, and I think it just is extraordinary.","I think my dad is this great, wonderful... man with a lot of integrity, who is fighting for things he believes in and is serious in what he wants to see happen and serious in helping people.","It was definitely a part of our life. I mean, my mom had both her brothers and her fiancee in Vietnam at the same time, so it wasn't just my dad's story, it was my mom's story too. And we definitely grew up listening to the stories.","It wasn't until two or three years ago that I actually learned that in the end he actually did kill someone. But that was a choice that he faced: to kill or be killed.","We don't necessarily always agree, but hopefully we make each other think, and that's what matters.","You're blinded by lights and you see all these people who come out, and it's exciting. It's scary and it's exciting all rolled into one.","I was very close to my mother, and her death, which left a gaping hole in my life, has been very difficult for me and my father in a lot of ways.","And I think we created something incredible as a Democratic group, as a platform, as an effort to make a change in the country, and I think we did change this country. And I think we will continue to, and I know that my father is not going to stop fighting.","I, for one, am actually still incredibly idealistic, and I still can credibly or very strongly believe that you have to keep fighting for what you believe in, because it's only when you stop that you've truly lost.","There has to be room for people to make mistakes and lead their own lives.","We don't want to be treated any differently, and we want to continue with our lives and our careers.","I have the rare privilege of talking to my dad every night at 10 p.m. and hearing about what he did that day."],"Vanessa Kirby":["Just simple things - I like black and white, monochrome; I like suits.","As I'm getting older, I feel like maybe I need to grow up a bit.","I feel people naturally have a brightness. When that is extinguished by circumstances - be it a wrong marriage or a situation that you cannot leave psychologically - there's something about that dying spark that I'm drawn to playing.","My characters are always unlucky in love. It's annoying, but perhaps there is something in me that is suited to characters that have a darkness. Maybe it's why I play such damaged people when I'm not particularly damaged myself, I would say.","I've been told that I have no filter.","Peter Morgan's writing is so much about what you don't say: you're saying one thing but there's 10 other things going on, and those are the best writers like Chekhov... they're masters at a sort of naturalism, and yet there is all the subtext.","I always go for the underdog or the rogue or the rebel.","What your insides are doing, your outside reflects, and what you give to yourself, you can give to others.","I always saw myself as a stage actress, and that was the reason I wanted to act, but very slowly, I've changed.","When I was auditioning for drama school and looking for a monologue, it was all, 'I'm whinging about my period or my baby that has died or my boyfriend...' Why can't you have a normal girl, talking about ideas?","I became completely obsessed with the Royal family, or at least the psychology behind them.","You are what you think. I really believe that. And I don't think you ever stop doubting yourself.","I don't see the point of grumpy people.","You should choose who you love.","Love whoever you want to love.","Growing up, the image I had of Princess Margaret was completely different. I knew that she was a slightly tragic figure, but I didn't know why. Now, I love her with my all my heart. She was such an amazing person, and getting to 'know' her better was an honor.","To play anybody real and famous is very scary.","It's quite rare that you find something that you can quite literally have an absolute ball doing, as well as the tough stuff and the difficult stuff and the pain.","I've been really lucky to work with a lot of theater directors in the film, like Stephen Daldry on 'The Crown' and Richard Eyre on 'The Dresser.'","I love the Sixties and all those iconic women, Bridget Bardot and things like that, so I tend to lean towards those sorts of things.","My favourite thing is cooking for my friends. There are 13 of us who all met at university. They come round once a week, and I make a huge lasagne.","My hair has been so wrecked over the years by various things.","I wanted to do theatre - it has always been my thing.","I always look at actresses who I most respect, and they make me think that you can make a choice in life. It's whether or not you choose to go down the route of publicising your personal life. I choose not to.","When I first started doing screen work, I thought, 'I'm not beautiful enough for this profession - all the actresses I watch on screen are gorgeous and beautiful goddesses, but I'm just a scrawny, scruffy girl from southwest London.'","Some of my favourite characters have been people like Masha in 'Three Sisters' and Elena in 'Uncle Vanya.'","I'm interested in what stops people getting what they want.","I think my natural home was always the stage.","As a person, I'm incredibly overfamiliar. I have to be careful what I say!","I try to focus on each day and try to be the best I can be today.","I went to a very academic school, but I never really quite... I think because not that many people were particular creative or arty, I felt a little bit different.","I hate the idea of massive fame. I think the scariest thing for an actor is when your name becomes bigger than your craft or what you can do.","Acting is a very weird job. But if you know you're an actor, you just have to do it. You can't do anything else.","Chris McQuarrie cast me in 'Mission Impossible' because he'd seen 'The Crown' and loved it.","My parents would always take me to the theatre, and I was bored a lot of the time. Loads of Shakespeare, and I didn't know what the hell was going on. And then, when I was 13, we went to see 'The Cherry Orchard,' and it changed everything for me.","Wherever you are in the world, whoever you are with, sometimes you feel desperately lonely.","So many times, you pick up a script, and you think, 'OK, so she's the sexy one,' or, 'She's the ex-girlfriend.'","I don't have a lot of instinctive fashion style myself.","I just love people. I love them a lot.","I doubt myself a lot but go forward at full throttle anyway.","I love the idea of being an Aries.","I never want to make any characters one-dimensional, especially as women can often be portrayed as the dark one or the evil one.","Family relationships are just so fascinating - how they shape you as a person, how you can wound each other, how you're imprinted in a way by your family and the conditions under which you grow up.","My dad is a big extrovert - he's a doctor - but he always loved Shakespeare, and he took us to tons of theater.","I do tend to find when you're playing characters, often - just for the time you're playing them - there are sides of your personality that get stronger because you draw on them more.","I did apply for drama school when I was 17, and I didn't get in; I had a really bad audition.","I thought, 'If I go to uni, I can read and watch people and take many different subjects - take philosophy modules - and have time to travel in the summers,' which I did. I thought, 'I hope this will make me a better actor,' and it did.","You're always one of the only girls, because there are so many male writers, and there are not enough good parts for women.","I did The 'Acid Test' at the Royal Court, by Anya Reiss, who's the most wonderful, amazing female writer. She was only 19 when she wrote it. She wrote it about three girls in a flat on a Friday night, and that was magic because it was so rare to have three girls in your age group in a play. It just doesn't happen.","I was always bossing my sister around.","I've always been so uninterested in playing any kind of archetype of some pure, innocent, virginal woman. I just don't believe it.","I've always been pretty indifferent towards the royal family. I went on a school trip once to Buckingham Palace, and all I can remember is that it was really boring.","Before filming 'The Crown,' I couldn't care less about the royal family. But now... I'm obsessed.","We know all about actors and singers because they do interviews, but with the royals, everything's so tightly controlled. They live this strange reality behind closed doors.","I've played a lot of untalented people.","I'm not interested in being known for anything other than the work.","Trying to balance theatre and film is really important to me.","On screen, everyone stares at your face, but on stage, you can basically play anybody.","My thoughts are ridiculously loud and fast.","I've got a really tight group of friends from university and school who help me forget what I do and keep me grounded.","I'm not a model. I don't really think much about how I look. If I did, I'd go mad.","When you see yourself on a 40-ft. screen. you go, 'Oh My God! I look so weird!'","The thing I really know is that I'm not a model. I'm an actress."],"Vanessa Lachey":["Trust is the most important part of a relationship, closely followed by communication. I think that if you have those two things, everything else falls into place - your affection, your emotional connection.","I think there should be a good balance between being a good student and being able to enjoy your high school life.","I hear the Sophie Giraffe is great for teething. Another thing I really love right now is the Moby Baby Carrier. To me, it seems like a natural way to hold the baby close to you. I also love the burp cloths, bibs, and swaddle blankets from Aden and Anais. Their stuff is organic and pure.","If you establish a routine for your child, then your routine can be more manageable.","With social media, people share mostly their best moments. Don't feel like you're not doing enough when you see a mom posting about making applesauce after you bought it. Ha ha! It's fine! Just for raising a little human being, you should be commended.","The thing about my high school, which I loved, is that we had uniforms. But whenever we had a free dress day, it was prep-ville, with sweater vests and polo shirts and khakis and Dockers.","Without a doubt, priority No. 1 is always my family. Whether it's my children or my husband or even my girlfriends who are also my family, I put them first no matter what. And it makes it easy to then juggle everything else because it's never a question.","Everything that went on in my life... it was super important for me to have Camden first. And by that I mean my son and to have that relationship with my son to give me that quiet confidence that I needed as a mother and as a woman. Now with Brooklyn, I am just so at ease; I am so comfortable.","I love seeing my husband hold our daughter and just give her kisses, unsolicited kisses. When he doesn't know that I'm watching or when I come into the room and I look over and he's just kissing her forehead or kissing her cheek. He loves her so much, and I love his love for her.","When I became a mother of two, I decided to work with brands that remind me of family because they're my No. 1 priority. Now I'm partnering with Puffs to encourage people to get out and not hibernate inside. People should enjoy the holiday season, and if you do have a runny nose or the sniffles, Puffs is there to take care of your symptoms.","My favorite role is mommy. I know that sounds cheesy to people who don't have kids, or there are even some moms who think it's cheesy. It's a role you can't prepare for; it's a role you don't get paid to do, but it is the most rewarding role, and to me, it's been the most fulfilling.","We love Popsicle in our house. Nick could probably down a whole box in one sitting; he's obsessed with the sugar free box, and I'm just obsessed with the classic.","What I love about Popsicle and the moments I can be with Camden is that their whole philosophy is family and these moments that it can create to just sit with my son, read a comic book or go outside on a hot day, take a swim and have a Popsicle treat with him.","It's funny because everyone says you sleep when baby sleeps or you take a nap when baby takes a nap. That's true when you have one. When you have two, that is not true.","I feel like the word 'mom' and 'supermom' should be synonymous. When you are a mom, you are a superhero.","For me, the love really flowed when I found out the baby was a boy. That's when I could finally bond, once I knew 'it' was a him.","I didn't grow up with a mother, so I don't have that resource to rely on and ask a million questions.","I gained, I think, 65 pounds when I was pregnant. And I will say to moms out there, 'Don't stress about losing it. It will happen when it happens.'","Spanx are amazing. Thank you to the inventor of that.","With acting, when you're reading a script, you're regurgitating someone else's words. There's a whole part of your brain that's off duty.","I went to eight different schools my first nine years of school.","I do a lot of damage to my hair every day because of my work. I just noticed this huge change. It started getting thinner, and it started falling out. I hit 30, and I literally felt like I was balding!"],"Vanessa Lengies":["My whole plan in my head has always been, if I go a year without acting, it's time to go home; it's time to go back to Montreal.","When I was younger, my dad was making a music video for a band in Montreal. I was goofing around and being a ham. An agent was there and she was telling me, 'Hey, do you think you'd want to go out on auditions?' I was like, 'Yeah, what's an audition? Sure, I'll do it.'","I love playing characters, so I'm always telling my agents, 'Don't worry if the character description is something you think I'm not. Let me try to be that person.'","I don't have a specific type of role that I aspire to play or aspire to act. I really like a challenge and I really like doing things that are different because if I had to do the same thing all the time, then I don't think I would be an actor.","During 'Hawthorne', I was constantly trying not to be too outrageous and keep it serious. This has been so refreshing for me because it's such a good outlet for the inner me to just be. That's the whole point of 'Glee' anyways - to just be who you are and that's enough. I really feel that way on set."],"Vanessa Mae":["Violin playing is a physical art with great traditions behind it.","In an ideal world, I'd spend every weekend at my home in Zermatt in Switzerland.","In winter I go skiing on Saturdays and Sundays when the slopes are quieter due to changeover day for tourists, and in summer I hike up into the mountains at sunset, just as the village is settling down to dinner.","But I still think it's mind over matter in the sense that if you're strong, you can combat anything.","But then I hit my 20s and only made two albums, and now I live in a ski resort as a ski bum basically.","Beethoven and Beatles, Mozart and Michael Jackson, Paganini and Prince - I like them all.","Music is about the performance.","Kids can be born with potential but unless it's encouraged - pushed, even - I don't think it will ever come to fruition.","But I don't think I've grown up to be a damaged adult.","All the time I'm changing as an artist and as a person.","I could have taken the easy life and just done classical, but I felt very strongly about the album, my first pop album, the first time that I'd fused so many influences. I was very proud when it was in the charts in 25 countries at once.","But I don't mind, I'm a bit of a touring animal. When I'm on tour that is the greatest thrill for me, playing to a live audience.","The stage is the best experience in the world. It's a great compliment to be able to share the music, because people can hear my album but they don't get to make the connection in the same way as when it's one-to-one.","I've decided to make my main priority for the next two years not playing the violin, but training for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.","People find it hard to understand how I can risk ruining my career as a musician by injuring myself on the slopes, but I've always been a tomboy.","I will be the Thai equivalent of Eddie the Eagle.","I don't mind about the boos from the audience.","When I hit my 20s, I took a chill pill and relaxed because throughout my teens I was churning out an album a year. It was a treadmill of work then recording, promoting and touring.","I started skiing around the same time as I began playing the piano, at around four, before moving to the violin at five.","Music will always be my greatest passion.","To even get to the Olympics, I have to qualify for the 2013 World Championships and the standard is high. I know I am always going to be a few points behind the top guys.","For example, I loved English and history at school. I would have loved to have done a degree in either. But my Mom said I didn't have time for university."],"Vanessa Marano":["I've been on plenty of sets where I have not liked the people that I work with, but you suck it up and be professional.","Everyone loves each other for the pilot. But once you start to do the show, you see everybody's true colors. If it's successful, people start to change, and then if it's not doing well, people start to change in other ways.","Who doesn't love a 'Lifetime' movie? I think that they know their audience so well.","When I was eleven, I got cast in the last directorial project of Christopher Reeve.","I'm very obsessed with 'The Real Housewives' franchise. It's a bad obsession.","I'm very into dark colors. I try to rock the dark against the ghost white skin as much as humanly possible.","Lizzy Weiss is such a great writer, and she really writes for the performances."],"Vanessa Marcil":["What makes a woman beautiful is her loyalty to and her friendships with other women, and her honesty with men.","I don't get this whole super-skinny obsession. I really think women look more beautiful when they let their curves show.","I eat whatever I want, junk food included.","I don't know any woman who doesn't have an anxiety attack about wearing a bathing suit.","Because of my crazy work schedule, I have become something of a master at changing my clothes while driving. The men driving next to me love it.","I'm not ready to be a woman yet, I'd like it if my body were more boyish. Maybe I'll like my curves when I'm older but right now they kind of make me squirm.","If I deny myself something, I just get resentful, so what's the point?","Acting probably saved my life. It gave me a home and a safe place to let out all of my emotions and have it be okay.","My family didn't have any money growing up. I'm just a girl from the ghetto; from Indio, California.","I love Vegas. It's like going to Disneyland."],"Vanessa Minnillo":["I think there should be a good balance between being a good student and being able to enjoy your high school life.","I am an Air Force brat - that's the terminology they use for military kids who are traveling constantly.","Well, the thing about my high school, which I loved, is that we had uniforms. But whenever we had a free dress day, it was prep-ville, with sweater vests and polo shirts and khakis and Dockers.","I went to eight different schools my first nine years of school.","The best advice I get is actually from my family and friends. That has been a huge resource I've come to rely on.","I didn't grow up with a mother, so I don't have that resource to rely on and ask a million questions.","I do a lot of damage to my hair every day because of my work. I just noticed this huge change. It started getting thinner and it started falling out. I hit 30, and I literally felt like I was balding!","It's a comforting thought to know that I've got my partner by my side walking through life and all the ups and the downs. I know we can handle it. There's nothing too big or too crazy that's going to tear us apart.","I think as I've gotten older, I've learned to look at life and take every day as it comes."],"Vanessa Morgan":["I was in a music class when I was little, and they discovered I had a talent and could sing. From there, I joined this singing troupe in California, and I would just go sing at festivals in this girl group and perform as much as I could.","I definitely understand what it's like not having family around when you want them there, but you don't live in the same city.","My mom helped me get started when I was younger. I started with singing. An agent saw me singing on stage at the Palm Springs Festival, and recommended I get into acting, so I was like, 'Oh, okay.' I just started from there, singing and acting.","I booked my first series when I was 13. Acting kind of took control because I was just going from part to part at that point."],"Vanessa Paradis":["Life is like the ocean, it goes up and down.","I liked to play dress-up.","Love is the strongest and most fragile thing we have in life.","The idea of a soulmate is beautiful and very romantic to talk about it in a movie or a song, but in reality, I find it scary.","I do sometimes strongly hope that in a past life, my most recent life before this, I was absolutely horrible, evil, hideous. Because otherwise - well, hell, to even things up next time around, I'm going to have to pay for this one, am I not?","I don't have the recipe for happiness, but I think the engine is simply having the desire.","I could sing in English before I could understand it because I phonetically learned it from the musicals.","It has been extraordinary, wonderful, I've been three feet off the ground since I made that first record.","The only thing I want to say is, I know I'm not Einstein, but I'm not the queen of the imbeciles either.","I was an only child until I was 11 years old, which is when my sister was born. So for 11 years, it was just me.","I was born in a suburb of Paris, and I grew up there until I was 16, so there were always a lot of barbecues, a garden, friends.","'Singin' in the Rain' was the one for me. Yeah. I mean, Gene Kelly could just sway and never fall. He'd just sway and sway as he danced.","You fall for who the chemistry is with.","In the winter I separate, in the summer I marry. It's been 15 years since I've been getting married every year.","You know, when I eat three peas, I'm pregnant. When I visit a city, I'm buying a house.","Cafe De Flore speaks of love, its joys, its pains and its dramas - to love and to lose. This story upset me, I was upside-down, in the depths of myself.","Not everyone is lucky enough to be given space and trust.","I love the romance of 'let's get married,' but then, when you have it so perfect... I mean, I'm more married than anybody can be - we have two kids. Maybe one day, but it's something I can really do without.","Nothing is ever for sure, but when something in love doesn't work from the beginning, it's never going to work. Don't push it.","I hate, for example, whenever you hear someone say, 'You have work at being a couple.'","When I started to record, I could sing in pitch, but that was maybe about it.","It's difficult when you want it all.","I love what I do.","When you meet the love of your life, it's just obvious and natural and easier.","Sometimes you could be in an unhappy relationship; you are very much in love with someone, but it's making you unhappy and you think things can change and you can work it out.","I was for sure not prepared for fame when it happened.","Fear can make all of us do the wrong things sometimes.","The movies and the parts I'm being offered are becoming better and better.","I don't like things set in stone.","I don't believe you can say 'forever'; I don't believe it exists.","Who said that artists should sell their soul, expose everything about themselves?","My children are grown now, they are more independent.","My daughter loves singing above all else.","As long as you're fully present in what you're doing at the moment, you're doing it.","Women are the real superheroes because they're not just working. They have a life and everything.","I'm super lucky because I come home and I don't have to run errands and clean the house and do all that.","You keep learning all the time.","Well, my type is obviously creative. Creative, with burning eyes and a pretty mouth.","How many times do I have to repeat this: my childhood was fantastic.","I realize how unique my path has been. And I'm thankful for that.","I mostly want to be friends with my children.","It amuses me when I'm described as 'chic.'","I just like putting outfits together without much thought and seeing what the outcome is.","I am a complete sentimentalist when it comes to clothes. I have so many memories attached to them that I can't throw anything out.","The red carpet is not something I really know how to work. It intimidates me. I feel very tiny.","I don't have famous neighbours and if I did, I'd avoid them. I don't live the jet-set.","My mum told me to have patience. It's about realising that when things aren't going the way you want them to, or you don't have inspiration, it will come.","There are forms of art that I might not like to do myself, but I still have respect for the artists who create it.","It's a courageous thing to do something that doesn't have rules or limits.","If your heart is in love, you can do anything.","The songs from your childhood, when you hear them you get chills all over.","I understand those who don't like me.","If you have the support of people with a heart and a brain, then you're good.","It's not my style to judge anybody.","I love clothes but I have spent so much of my professional life creating an image of one kind or another that it is nice not to care about it in life and let your skin breathe.","I'd rather sing a good lyric written by someone else than one of my own that is terrible.","People don't get through to the essence of you right away - it's always the famous 'girl' or the famous 'girlfriend'. I'd rather be known for myself."],"Vanessa Ray":["Whatever age you think I am, you're probably right.","I visualized high school as being like 'Saved By the Bell.'","I visualized high school as being like 'Saved By the Bell.' I decided I would do all the things they did on that show.","I've worked with a couple of these really cool, great actors like Ted Danson and Glenn Close. They all have their own presence when they walk into a room, and I was excited to see what Tom Selleck's 'space' was going to be like."],"Vanessa Redgrave":["Integrity is so perishable in the summer months of success.","Ask the right questions if you're to find the right answers.","Shakespeare lets us see real people undergoing real processes, with real feelings.","Theater and poetry were what helped people stay alive and want to go on living.","A theater is being given over to market forces, which means that a whole generation that should be able to do theater as well as see it is being completely deprived.","The society Shakespeare knew was heading for tremendous change, and he seems to have recognized that and written about it in a coded way. I understand those codes, I think."],"Vanessa Williams":["Success is the sweetest revenge.","I think there's a time to work, and everyone has to kind of adjust. And then there's a time to relax, and be the mom or take the kids on vacation when you need to wind down. So it's a matter of planning, and being able to map out your year or your week or let's start with the day. It is just being multi-tasking and being available.","You're always going to have people that are naysayers, that don't believe in your talent, that don't believe that you have any kind of longevity.","The wiser you get, the more experience you have, and the more you see people for who they are as human beings, as opposed to figures you have to fight against.","Well, my mom taught public school music for almost 40 years. And she's about 5 feet - and very mighty. And she would control her kids a lot by giving them the eye, or the stare.","I am lucky to have three daughters who are completely different. I look at my daughters and I have different relationships with all three and there are parts of each personality that are very special.","My parents are both teachers, so we had the summers off.","Broadway is really my life.","New York is my home.","I love the French horn.","And when people give me their word, I listen to them.","And at 19, you think you rule the world, and you can control things. And a lot of times, you don't.","There are a lot of things that you don't realize that your parents are going through when you're a kid."],"Vanilla Ice":["Show me a smile, and I'll show you one back.","I live off a motto that says, 'yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery'. I have goals and agendas. Where ever I'll be tomorrow, that's where I'll be.","I don't have any reason to hate anybody; I believe in good karma and spreading good energy.","It's about enjoying your life. If you have no family, no friends to enjoy it with, it don't matter how much you have, how much success you have, how much fame you have, how much money you have, it doesn't matter.","One thing I didn't understand in life was that I had $100,000,000 in the bank and I couldn't buy happiness. I had everything: mansions, yachts, Ferraris, Lamborghinis, but I was depressed. I didn't know where I fitted in. But then I found family and friends and I learned the value of life.","Learn from my mistakes and you don't have to make them yourself.","I'm a random guy. I shake a hand and make a friend. I don't do egotistical things.","I'm a Christian, but I don't believe in religion or anything like that.","I do freestyle jumping. Been doing since I was eight years old and can't quit. I'm addicted. I've broken many bones, but I ride with confidence. It's my thing - there's no high on earth like it. It's my hobby and I really enjoy it.","When 'Ice Ice Baby' was selling a million records a day, I bought several properties: a home next to Michael J. Fox in L.A., a palace in Miami and a mountain cabin in Utah. Then, a few years later, I took a break from touring, saw that my properties had cobwebs, so I sold them, and - to my surprise - I made a huge profit!","Listen, if you don't talk big game, you never get anywhere. If you don't think big, you don't get big. Some people call it egotistical, some people call it high hopes, some people call it confidence. It's all in how you want to dissect it.","Negativity spreads faster than any Justin Bieber song.","I turn my negatives into my positives because one of my mottos is, 'Yesterday's history, tomorrow's a mystery,' meaning that you can't go back and change anything in the past.","Honestly, a lot of people thought that I was on top of the world selling so many millions of records, and that this is the life that everybody would want, but I never got to enjoy any of my success.","I bring people on stage with me. It's a good time, and people love to join in on the party. Show me a smile, and I'll show you one back.","If you look at the statistics, people spend most of their time in the kitchen. Aside from the backyard, it's one of my favorite places to renovate.","This was totally influenced by me and the direction that I am writing about and the stuff that I am writing about. There is just no way that you can be as intense as what I have been through in my life over a drum beat machine, sample, or loop; it's just not going to happen.","It wasn't until '94 when I tried to commit suicide that I realized that it wasn't about the money.","I didn't end up going bankrupt... I made some great investments and I held on to my money, which also enables me to have the freedom to do what I want now. But it's not about finances. No matter what, it's about keeping it real.","With the mega-fame came the mega-downfall - you know, with the press and everything - and at a young age, it was very stressful to me.","I had a pretty modest upbringing; it was no pleasure cruise. I don't think I would be as happy today if I hadn't been through that. It was tough; I made some bad choices myself.","Another car is not going to help me out, a nicer car, I've already got it. A bigger house ain't gonna do anything for me, and you know, a yacht, it's not going to do anything for me anymore. So how can I find happiness?","For three years, between 16 and 19, I was the opening-act-for-the-opening-act-for-the-opening-act, you know? And then I was on tour with Ice-T, Stetsasonic, EPMD, Sir Mix-a-Lot - legends - and went on to sell 160 million records. It still baffles me.","I got caught up on drugs for a few years, I'm off it, I'm very happy, got two kids and a family and everything. And like I said I'm making the underground music, and keeping it real.","Shows have been sold out. It's overwhelming, you know. I had no idea what to expect with this new sound and everything and just to see so many people just come out and embrace it, it's overwhelming.","I use the music to vent, and a lot of the stuff that I am writing about or was writing about contained a lot of anger and anxiety, stress and depression, so that's how the album came out so dark.","I used the music kind of as therapy, and it's just amazing that I feel so free after doing that. I feel like I had it trapped inside of me and now I feel free. So it's been a very good therapy session for me as well.","I just kept it real and had the freedom to do what I want. It's not designed for any age group. It's not made for radio. There are no edits. The whole album contains explicit lyrics but that's because you need it.","It took me a while and a lot of hard times to figure out my purpose, I am so happy with my life. I just want to help make other people happy, too.","My breakdancing crew used to go to the mall and squat a piece of cardboard there; we had our jam box, and I'd spin on my head and make about forty bucks a day, which was pretty good back then. I was only 14 years old, so I would chase the girls around the mall and eat some pizza and have some change left over.","Even in a bad market, location, location, location is a way to still buy and sell property.","I don't harp on what I could change about the past, because I can't go back and change it. But definitely a lot of things I would change.","I know this will blow your mind, but most people would probably never ever get it, but I listen to classical music when nobody else is around. It calms me down and I can get into this, like, deep thinking mode, you know, because there's really no lyrics to it, so you're not following something that - that you're listening to a story.","To be truthful, Jay-Z wouldn't have a quarter of the records sold today if it wasn't for the white people buying his records.","I turned a lot of people in white America - and not just white America, but middle-class America - into hip-hoppers, you know?","My main thing is music; it's what I do.","I meet everybody. If somebody invites me to their house and they got a drum set close, I'm going to play, man. Let's jam. I don't care. Get in where you fit in and enjoy the experience.","I have been known to hang out and party back in the day. I had a weekend that lasted a few years.","I was born in Dallas, Texas, but I was raised in south Florida. 'Ice Ice Baby' is about that area.","I've been playing concerts for many years, and it's still as exciting as it was the first time. I hope that shows when I'm performing.","Rap is from the streets and I'm from the streets. That's why a lot of people accept me.","I will not say anything about my father. Period. I don't have a dad.","I've never met anybody in this world like me.","To me, a critic is some loser who has no idea... someone with an opinion. We all have opinions. No offense, but what makes them dictate what is cool and what is not.","I do a lot of TV stuff, but I also turn a lot down - it's got to be an adventure.","I've never left music behind, but I've had success in television.","I'm the kind of guy who really likes a challenge. It's more rewarding.","I have a very broad demographic, from the 8-year-old who knows every word to 'Ice Ice Baby' and the college kid who grew up on 'Ninja Rap' to the soccer mom and grandparent.","I like Jay-Z, 50 Cent and Common. But I like the underground stuff like Young Jeezy, Black Rob and Shine. I also love heavy metal like Slipknot and Pantera, It's very intense stuff.","I own a mortgage company and a real estate company funded by the music. Florida is a kinda gold mine.","My mom raised me to be clean, so it's in my nature. I have two little girls, and I'm married, but we've got a nanny and a maid.","A lot of people think I was an overnight success, but I was an opening act for three or four years, and then I signed my contract with EMI. Then it kind of blew up overnight.","I like Cleveland. I like the Cavaliers. Nothing wrong with Cleveland. I have lots of friends there.","A lot of people don't remember anything since 'Ice Ice Baby,' but I've got 3 records out since then and they're all successes - but not commercially.","More than half of all the hip hop record sales are white people, and I think that might be a result of my record helping people to accept hip hop.","If you grew up in my generation, you're going to be influenced by Run DMC, the Beastie Boys and also listen to Metallica - it wasn't segregated anymore.","I didn't want the public in my personal life at all - I thought that people might perceive me as too normal, and I'd lose that larger-than-life rock star persona. You've got to protect that!","And all the zig-zags and lines in my hair? I used to do that myself. I just thought it was cool that you could actually do that with your hair.","Concerts every night, autograph signings, endorsements, and so on. That's not what real life is about."],"Vanity":["Every day, I wake up and say, 'Good Morning, Jesus.'","I don't listen to my old music of Vanity's unless I have to hear it playing in a mall or something place like that.","A girl's best friend is her pride.","I was young and irresponsible, a silly woman laden with sin, not caring for anything except fame and fortune and self. But I have lived seeking truth in Jesus Christ and found it has made me free.","Getting past my past... was a process, a very serious process indeed.","I repent daily my sins, my faults, and my shortcomings.","I had internal bleeding with blood clots on the brain. I was completely blind and deaf. I had a heart attack and a stroke.","Things have changed. Now it's not the outward appearance, it's the inward man that I'm trying to change. And that's the message I bring to the people.","I go to wherever God calls me, wherever the church calls me to come to minister and preach the word of God.","I sing to Jesus for Jesus now. This gives me pure joy... worship!","I apologize profusely to those I have offended deeply a million times over.","I was miserable the entire time I was Vanity. I spent so many days and so many nights crying, hating who I'd become.","According to God's word, we haven't done a very good job concerning our little ones, nor our teens.","'Vanity' means worthlessness.","Vanity was a joke. She was an image created to make money.","I look at singing and acting as one career, and I love the chance to do both in the same project. I need to do both. When I'm doing one, I miss the other.","I wish I had come along when the studios were making those big musical pictures. It would be great to do re-makes of some of the old ones like 'Porgy and Bess' or 'Showboat.' I'd love to do 'em.","I'm totally comfortable with myself.","People think stars never have any problems or cares. That's bull. Why would we show any more than one mask to the public. There's a whole lotta things I've done that I don't want to think about. But I bring it all right out when I need it for a role.","I never thought, 'Oh God, I'm in Prince's shadow.' He'd been performing for years, and he was my teacher.","I never want to be that person again, that Vanity.","Boy, it is not fun suffering in this body of weak flesh, but Jesus is straightening out all my crooked places.","An abused childhood affects the entire life... It affects every facet of the life.","Prince and I happen to think alike.","I used to sneak into my mother's closet and try to wear her lingerie to school.","I'm a real romantic."],"Vanna Bonta":["Gossip can be entertaining: occasionally, I've heard the most fascinating things about myself I never knew.","Life is a canvas of many strokes where shades from different palettes meet into a picture so concrete that some forget it is their own, so become framed themselves.","It's weird how people who are the least close to me or who've never even met me purport to be experts on the real me; and then, sadly, there are those who could be in touch with me but prefer to gossip with strangers about me instead.","Looking up and out, how can we not respect this ever-vigilant cognizance that distinguishes us: the capability to envision, to dream, and to invent? the ability to ponder ourselves? and be aware of our existence on the outer arm of a spiral galaxy in an immeasurable ocean of stars? Cognizance is our crest.","Greed is the lack of confidence of one's own ability to create.","We can have a World War, I see absolutely no reason why we shouldn't have a World Party.","You have to know you can first. How comes later.","Atheism is a religion itself complete with fanatics and bigots.","Sex in space is not just a good idea, it's survival.","The song 'What Goes Up' was inspired as I was playing the piano and reminiscing about the Spaceship One launches I witnessed in the Mojave desert. It is an awesome thing to comprehend the magnitude of what a human being dreams and imagines can be realized.","Space is as infinite as we can imagine, and expanding this perspective is what adjusts humankind focus on conquering our true enemies, the formidable foes: ignorance and limitation.","Thought makes reality.","Cinnamon bites and kisses simultaneously."],"Vanna White":["I enjoy getting dressed as a Barbie doll.","It's not the most intellectual job in the world, but I do have to know the letters.","When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off.","I think people think of me as this elegant person because they always see me dressed up.","I'm really just a normal person.","I do everything that everybody else does.","I have a family and two cats; I get up with my kids early in the morning.","There's five cameras, I don't know how many people in the audience... depending on where we're taping, there can be anywhere from 300 to 5,000 people, so the contestants are nervous.","So, I understand when they make a mistake and everyone at home is throwing their shoe at the television set.","I feel for the players.","I will say I remember the best thing in terms of publicity was being on the cover of Newsweek.","I'm a mom, a full-time mom when I'm not taping. I do the carpool thing, and bake the cookies, and do the homework."],"Vannevar Bush":["Fear cannot be banished, but it can be calm and without panic; it can be mitigated by reason and evaluation.","If scientific reasoning were limited to the logical processes of arithmetic, we should not get very far in our understanding of the physical world. One might as well attempt to grasp the game of poker entirely by the use of the mathematics of probability.","Science has a simple faith, which transcends utility. It is the faith that it is the privilege of man to learn to understand, and that this is his mission.","A belief may be larger than a fact.","The scene changes but the aspirations of men of good will persist.","To pursue science is not to disparage the things of the spirit. In fact, to pursue science rightly is to furnish the framework on which the spirit may rise."],"Vano Merabishvili":["There is no chance of a revolution in Georgia.","If there is no threat to the lives of the citizens, our tactic will be to not intervene or impede members of the protest in expressing their will freely.","My position does not give me the liberty to exclude anything, but my mood tells me there will not be violence.","We plan to spend 20 billion lari ($12 billion) from the budget in the next four years on implementation of all tasks presented in our new programme.","I think there are three main values which are fundamental: that Georgia will never be a criminal country, that Georgia will never return to corruption, and that Georgia will be independent."],"Varley O'Connor":["Fiction connects: past and present; the great and the small; the surface with the depths. Fiction brings out the innermost, invisible springs of life that cannot be revealed in factual narratives.","The fact is fiction is always a representation of life, sometimes the lives of famous people.","Fiction seeks to represent human experience as it is lived and as it reverberates in our hopes, fears, dreams, and memories. So much of our lives are internal. The art of fiction has claimed - more than anything else - this internal ground as its own.","What novels do that biographies don't is get at truths by penetrating the facts, by going deeper to what's underneath fact, through invention."],"Vartan Gregorian":["Dignity is not negotiable. Dignity is the honor of the family.","Everybody is somebody, so you don't have to introduce anybody.","Libraries keep the records on behalf of all humanity. the unique and the absurd, the wise and the fragments of stupidity."],"Varun Dhawan":["For me, fitness is a part of my everyday life. But fitness does not mean having big muscles; it means being active, quick, and flexible. It can be defined in many terms.","Anything I do in life, the first person I share it with is my elder brother. He always tells me the way to take it forward.","Goodness is something people take advantage of, and if you want to remain a good person for long, you should make sure that too many people don't take advantage of you because then you turn bitter.","Filmmaking is a very serious job, and I want to concentrate on that.","I am always excited to be an actor. If I wasn't, I would be acting, and the audience wouldn't watch me.","Shah Rukh Khan is such a gentleman that he doesn't intimidate anyone. He is nothing but sweet to everyone, and he has been absolutely amazing to me.","My trainer is very helpful in keeping me fit.","I used to have lot of arguments with my mother due to a lot of bruises on my body for trying my hand at wrestling. I used to say, 'I am Rock,' and I would get slapped.","We are an industry, and we are all in this together and can't survive without each other. I feel it is high time we realise that. If we go against each other, or if we get happiness from other people's fall, then there is no way we will move ahead.","You have one heart, and once you give it away, it's gone. If you wear it on your sleeve, a lot of people are there to take advantage of it.","It's not easy to put a smile on people's faces.","I'm not invincible. I am not picture-perfect. The reason I am here is not because of the money; if I get to entertain people and put a smile on their face, I feel content.","I have a large heart, and there are many special people in my heart like my mom, my dad and brother and his wife.","I realise that women don't want to get treated differently but just equally. I don't know what feminism is all about, but I understand that women should be treated equally, and I endorse that thought.","My dream role would be a role that is entertaining and 'massy,' and it should be able to make people laugh and cry and make the audience scared of me and then make them fall in love with me again.","I have been passionate about fitness from a very young age.","My whole outlook towards women changed after 'Badrinath Ki Dulhania.' I am a boy who is brought up in Mumbai, and I believe I am open-minded. But I realised that there were so many things my mind was not expanded to.","I think it's unfair for people to decide what my strength is after just three films.","I don't want to be known as a 'player.' I don't want to give plastic smiles on television and say 'No comments.'","Every creativity has a motive. Either one does it for money, for fame, or for passion. My energies go out for passion.","I went through a big Jim Morrison phase where I grew my hair and wore those black leather pants. I even tried to get the boots, the chains, and I was full into getting that Jim Morrison vibe... but I didn't go overboard or try the mascara.","I follow my heart and my instinct about films and people.","I definitely think if you're born into the industry, you get easier access, but that's about it. I have never denied that, but after that, only talent and hard work sustains you.","I don't really care what anyone else is doing. I'm only focussed on my work.","Social media makes you think.","I am very happy for anyone who is in love.","I have this dream of directing. But as a child, I wanted to become a wrestler. Like, in childhood, we used to watch WWF; I was inspired by all of that. One of my favourite wrestlers was Rock, who has become an actor.","I wanted to be performer; like, I used to dance at weddings. I felt acting was my calling, and that is something I wanted to do.","To do your first film is a dream.","I am a huge fan of shows like 'Breaking Bad,' 'Dexter,' 'The Mentalist.'","My brother starting earning early in life. I stopped taking money from my parents, and my brother would give me the pocket money.","My father never raised his voice or his hand on me when I was a kid.","I am restless like my father and do two-three things at a time.","I have trained, but not really that much professionally. But 'ABCD2' has been the biggest training ground. I've been exposed to and learnt so many dance forms through this film.","Salman bhai is amazing, and he is one of the greats of our cinema, and I don't think I should be compared to Salman Khan.","It's true that I am surrounded by beautiful women in the movies. But the romance is only on screen.","I am passionate about cinema in general. Eventually, I am making films for people to watch and enjoy, but somewhere, I have to be satisfied, too. I want to be happy after doing a film.","Let film-makers take a call about what films they want to do.","I don't want to be in the news for anything negative.","I don't think you need a particular day to dedicate to your dad or to make your father or parents feel special. A child should make his or her parents feel special every day and vice versa.","After finishing my business administration course, I had gone to look for a job in a multinational bank, but the interviewee said that I should become an actor.","Whether you work with your family or someone from outside, you can't take the audience for granted.","My first proper relationship was at 16 in college.","The word 'star' is misused. A good film will never fail. And if you have become an actor to become a star, then your reason of being in this profession is wrong. It amounts to abusing the art.","When I was in college, I was madly in love with a girl. But unfortunately, her father didn't approve of the match. He didn't like me because I was on the verge of joining the film industry.","To be very honest, I worked harder on 'Humpty...' I did many workshops. I never did workshops in 'Main Tera Hero.'","I want everyone to go back home feeling happy after watching all my films.","My take on fashion involves comfort.","Compared to other people, I am not that narcissistic. Sometimes, I don't even plan all that I wear.","My parents brought me up to be comfortable in one's own body. And I have always been comfortable in my own skin.","If I had to imagine life without my family, it would be very difficult.","I think listening to the director is the number one strength an actor should have.","When you are signing a film, you should not miss the beginning process which involves workshops and discussions; otherwise, it is difficult to understand the character.","Directors have good and bad movies. My father also made some flop movies, and he had bigger hits, too. That should not determine anything.","I find it very difficult to work with people I don't like; I can't do that.","I do films that I'd also like to watch as an audience member.","I have no issues in talking about my personal life, but I feel it takes away from my career and my characters, especially when a film is about to release.","Language is no barrier. I watch Telugu movies, and I really enjoy them.","If given a chance, I would like to work with Surender Reddy.","For me, more than general box-office collections, what really matters is that I am doing something that I enjoy and love.","I want the films of every person I am compared to and am reportedly in competition with to do better than me.","What matters is whether the audience likes the film or not. Everything else is secondary.","If you are a great guy off screen but you are a bad actor and are dishonest to your work, then I would not spend my money on you.","I like normal girls. When I come home, I don't want to discuss films; I want to discuss what her world is like and other things.","I am choosing films only to entertain people, but at the same time, if someone is putting their money into my films, I want that person to make money.","When I was growing up, I heard horror stories about producers losing their houses overnight. No matter who the family is, hearing of them getting evicted is very sad.","For me, the driving force is the audience, and the day that stops, I will stop doing films. The day a part of me stops feeling like putting a smile on someone else's face or if I feel like I don't want to entertain anymore, then I will pack up and leave.","I love cinema and creating new things, but essentially, I am creating all this because I want people to see it.","Stardom can be obtained only after surviving and giving good films for almost 20 years.","The real stars who have dedicated their services to the film industry are Salman Khan, Shahrukh Khan, Aamir Khan, and Akshay Kumar. I do not come in this league at all.","A lot of people have agencies to handle their social media, but I handle everything myself. That's why there are a lot of grammatical errors. When I write, it's all me!","I want to make sure that people feel it's okay to make a mistake, to have a bad hair day, to look bad sometimes. It takes the pressure off them.","In daily life, I'm not a heavy user anyway, but I'm extra careful online because of the kids who look up to me. That's the fun part of being an actor - that kids like you - because they are very pure and transparent in their likes and dislikes. There's no filter like the ones on Instagram.","I'm most active on Instagram, then Twitter, and then Facebook. I haven't opened up Snapchat for the public; it's only for my friends.","Captain America is a matured and a balanced leader. This is something that I am not. So, that made it all the more challenging for me. 'Captain America: Civil War' is bigger, better, and the action is huge. It's a film for kids and adults, and the actual moral of the film is something I loved and believed in. So, I was very happy to voice it.","I am growing with my audience. When I made my debut, I was 24, and they have grown up with me. They are with me with each choice of mine.","People think the effort is less in popular commercial cinema, but that's not true.","I believe in live-in relationships, but most of the time, I am living out of hotel rooms. So, I don't know where I would have a live-in relationship.","When a film fails, the lead actor is always blamed for it.","My dad has always been vocal about critically appreciating me. If I have done a bad job, he will definitely try to correct me with his inputs.","I've always been a bit of a rebel.","I'm alright with people making up stuff about me, but not when there's a woman involved.","I feel if an opportunity comes your way, you should not let it go.","I've been blessed to get the kind of films I have done.","As an actor, overexposure can affect you negatively if you keep repeating yourself. But thankfully, my films are really different from each other.","My parents are my world.","One has to always do better work than their previous film. It is essential to do something new every time.","I do get motivated seeing Parineeti Chopra.","I am protecting my personal life because for me, that's my sanctity. When I am done with shooting and home, that's my reality check.","Although there is a beast in all of us, we don't show it often. But it is very liberating to be that angry at times. Given a chance, I'm sure people would like to go on a rampage and break everything.","I do a mix and match of many exercises. But before anything I do, I go for a warm up, as it of prime importance.","The translation of social media buzz does not really happen. Films do well through word of mouth.","When something is not liked by people, you cannot make it run, however big actor or producer you may be. The audience has to make it a hit. The power is in the hands of the public.","I see a lot of actor-bashing because they are the face of the film. Actors are just following someone else's direction.","Every film is like a baby for me; it's like my own child. I feel protective and aggressive each time my film hit theatres.","Nobody is ready to burn money just because you have a filmi lineage.","Superstars in every era have come from outside the industry, and that will continue to happen because cinema is nobody's birthright.","Things have to touch me as a human being. I do films that touch my heart.","I am not looking or thinking that every move of mine will generate mass hysteria.","I always put myself in the audience's seat, whether it is a film like 'Judwaa 2' or 'Badlapur.' There has to be a message; the core story needs to have a hook, which should be out of the ordinary."],"Vash Young":["Any experience can be transformed into something of value.","I know the joy of skating on a clear cold day. I know the joy of getting off a perfect drive in golf. I know the delight of a fine meal after a long walk. These are real and wholesome, but all of them put together can not approach the thrill of ridding yourself of fear!","There is no finer sensations in life that which comes with victory over one's self. Go forward to a goal of inward achievement, brushing aside all your old internal enemies as you advance.","I have always noticed that a man who gives the most for the money, gets the most business.","It often happens that the man who pursues the dollar too diligently finds it hard to catch, but if he will pursue some other and better goal, dollars come around to see what sort of fellow he is.","There have been many occasions when I found it helpful to talk out loud to my own thoughts, ordering the unwholesome ones to go off somewhere and jump into the river.","No man can add one dollar to his bank account by worrying.","Time and time again, as a boy, I was humiliated. I celebrated my first day in long pants by going to a dance where I fell sprawling on the floor, and was so ashamed that I jumped up, ran away and left my girl to get home the best way she could.","My first job, which I had to take when not more than fifteen, was assistant to a fruit peddler. It seemed all right to me until a little girl told me snootily, 'We never deal with peddler!' Thereupon I resigned, ashamed of what I was doing.","A truth discovered always seems so plain and simple that we wonder why the discovery was so long delayed.","All my life I had feared to-morrow, until I decided to have faith and to live to-day in courage.","Very few persons go through life without at least one big chance. The fact that so many do not grasp it is due more often to fear than to any other one thing.","Pressure selling is firmly rooted in American economic life, and I'm sorry it is, for it should not be necessary. Some people think part of the panic following 1929 was due to too much pressure in selling."],"Vasily Grossman":["I have written only what I have thought through, felt through and suffered through.","Humanity will live as long as there are humans."],"Vaughn Monroe":["I knew that we were clicking when mimics started kidding my voice, I'll know that I'm on the way out when they stop doing their imitations.","There are hundreds of people running around with great voices. If they would study and develop them they could become great singers.","Well, we like to let down our hair and pep it up at the dances, but we keep it slower when we broadcast. We have to please everybody, and that softer music appeals to the larger amount of people. It's like eating too much cake. You have to have your steak too.","How in the world any one weighing 185 pounds can be cute is beyond me.","If I had my choice, I'd pick a song that tells a story every time. There is a great deal of pleasure in doing the vocal on a number that you can put feeling into.","It now costs more to amuse a child than it once did to educate his father."],"Vayalar Ravi":["Migration - whether emigration or return - at the micro level is an individual choice, and government both at the Centre and the states have role only to facilitate the decision of the individuals.","The government plans to bring in a new science, technology and innovation policy in 2013.","Out of the 1.2 billion people in India, one-third of them are between the age of 1-14 and by 2030, India will have a dynamic and youthful workforce of about 700 million with an average age of 35. This is expected to constitute a substantial proportion of world's workforce.","As per the age-old Customs and Central Excise Rules 1967, a person is allowed to carry only Rs 20,000 worth of gold.","Our policy is not to discourage the private sector, but to see that Air India plays the role of flagship in the industry. In the transport sector, Air India is the 'fate of India' and all efforts will be made to restore its past glory.","The constitution is itself the product of the freedom struggle."],"Veerappa Moily":["I am not suggesting that just by taking the Metro, I will save billions. But I hope others will follow.","Saving petrol is saving India's money. This is a sense of patriotism. The country can be energy-independent by energy conservation. I appeal to the other ministers also to do this.","By 2020, 50 percent of imports should be reduced, which should become 75 percent by 2025. By 2030, India should be energy independent.","Petrol price is a deregulated commodity, price of which is decided by our oil marketing companies based on input cost and other parameters.","Fuel conservation is a necessity, and I have to be the first person to set the example.","It's a voluntary act. I cannot punish anyone not taking the public transport, but I want everyone, from the highest ranking officers to the lowest, to take public transport every Wednesday.","We are not in the regime of Aurangzeb. We are in the regime of rule of law. When rule of law is concerned, it applies to government, it applies to Supreme Court, it applies to everybody.","If all of us work in accordance with rule of law, if rule of law is implemented, we are all safe, investors are safe, people will be safe.","Fuel conservation is as important as fuel production.","I am not helpless. Any timid minister will not go forward... I have come here to strive hard for the sake of the country, to work for the country. If anybody thinks that decision making process in the oil sector will be prevented, they are totally wrong.","In the process of ego, in the process of lobbying and in the process of just criticising for stake of criticism or in the process of politicising, don't commit national crime. Don't prevent exploration in the country. Let us move ahead more aggressively; it is in the best interest of the country.","I am not playing for any lobby. I am playing for national lobby. I will ignore lobby. Anybody has useful suggestion, they can give it to me. The history will speak about it.","We need to do more to conserve fuel or face tougher choices such as steep price increase or even quantitative restrictions.","I have written to Minister of State for Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, asking him to consider 'staggered office timings' for government offices, which will help in decongesting road traffic during peak hours.","India has large proven reserves of gas that remain unexploited.","The consumption of petroleum should be conserved. We need to adopt some austerity measures. The people should cooperate with us.","If I can save 25 billion dollars in terms of reduction of import, I will be adding one percent to the GDP. By conserving the oil energy by the people, the GDP will become 5.5 percent, and this will change the economy of the country.","We as a nation have no choice but to conserve fuel to the best of our abilities or be prepared for harsh measures like steep price increase, if the need so arises.","There are people with vested interest who do not want us to reform our energy sector so that we remain dependent on imports. All reform moves are resisted. Bureaucrats are hesitant to take bold decisions.","Those who know me would tell you, 'Moily can't be cowed down.' I have plans to enhance domestic oil and gas production.","As the law minister, I had ensured that the government's right to natural resources was protected. The result was evident. The honourable Supreme Court gave the landmark decision in RIL vs RNRL case that the government is the owner of all natural resources."],"Vendela Kirsebom":["In the future, I want a movie career, kids and a happy marriage.","I'm so lucky, I've been so successful, so much has come my way.

Potential is often hard to spot, but a key factor is whether they express a genuine interest in the problem and how they have thought about it.","It's for scientists to lay out the data and lay out what they think, and then it's for the public to make up its own mind. We don't live in a priesthood where some small group imposes its views on other people - that's not the way that science works, and it's not the way a democratic society should work.","I knew the ribosome was going to be the focus of Nobel prizes. It stands at the crossroads of biology, between the gene and what comes out of the gene. But I had convinced myself I was not going to be a winner.","I remember reading a 'Scientific American' article about the use of new physical techniques - including neutron scattering - as a method for unravelling the structure of the ribosome. I was fascinated.","It takes a certain amount of courage to tackle very hard problems in science, I now realise. You don't know what the timescale of your work will be: decades or only a few years.","I was born in 1952 in Chidambaram, an ancient temple town in Tamil Nadu best known for its temple of Nataraja, the lord of dance.","My mother, R. Rajalakshmi, taught at Annamalai University in Chidambaram, and during the day, I was well cared for by aunts and grandparents in the usual way of an extended Indian family.","Unusually for an Indian man of his generation, my father, being aware of my mother's intellectual abilities, encouraged her to go abroad by herself to obtain a Ph.D.","My childhood and adolescence were filled with visiting scientists from both India and abroad, many of whom would stay with us. A life of science struck me as being both interesting and particularly international in its character.","During the decade following the discovery of the double-helical structure of DNA, the problem of translation - namely, how genetic information is used to synthesize proteins - was a central topic in molecular biology.","I began studying ribosomes as a postdoctoral fellow in Peter Moore's laboratory in 1978.","The success in the determination of the high-resolution structures of ribosomal subunits and eventually the whole ribosome was the culmination of decades of effort.","I am very grateful for the dedicated work and intellectual contributions of generations of talented postdocs, students and research assistants without whom none of the work from my laboratory would have been possible.","I started working on ribosomes when I was a post doc, in 1978, when it would have been impossible, really, to solve it. But, it was just a fundamental problem in biology.","I had an excellent math and physics teacher in high school named T.C. Patel, and in the university, I had truly dedicated professors in both physics and mathematics who gave me a sound foundation with which to pursue graduate studies.","I think it is a mistake to judge science by Nobel Prizes.","Scientists are not movie stars or politicians who will feel insulted if they are not showered with accolades. Scientists are not interested in accolades.","Science is an international enterprise where discoveries in one part of the world are useful in other parts.","My earlier exposure to physics certainly helped me in the use of biophysical techniques like crystallography, the use of computing, calculations, etc.","Ultimately, biological phenomena involve molecules, and understanding them involves understanding the underlying chemistry. In my opinion, this is a particularly exciting area of chemistry.","We live in an increasingly technological world where the issues are quite complex and based on some complicated science.","The Royal Society view is completely apolitical: it will judge anything based on the evidence. One of the big strengths of the Society is that is it widely perceived as impartial and above the fray. We'd like to make sure it stays that way.","People go into science out of curiosity, not to win awards. But scientists are human and have ambitions.","Even the best scientists are often insecure and feel the need for recognition.","I realise I have inadvertently become a source of inspiration and hope for people in India simply by the fact that I grew up there, went to my local university, but could go on to do well internationally.","There is no room for political, personal or religious ideologies in science.","Governments and scientists in India need to ensure that politics and religious ideology do not intrude into science. They belong to separate spheres, and if they are not kept separate, it is science in India and the country as a whole that will suffer.","We benefit tremendously from the E.U. Britain does very well in getting back E.U. money for the amount it puts in.","There's a perception out there that the U.K. has become unfriendly to immigrants. Even if that isn't true, the very fact that that is the perception will make people not even want to come.","I think we are intrinsically prone to being irrational and superstitious. A lot of it comes from our fear of the unknown and the fear of a lack of control over our fate.","Like the women in my family, I've found the women in my lab a hard-nosed, ambitious lot who have gone on to be faculty members at top universities. In my own family, it is my father who is prone to bursting into tears.","Nobody has approached me about an offer to work in India. However, I can categorically state that if they did so, I would refuse immediately.","I cannot imagine a more enjoyable place to work than in the Laboratory of Molecular Biology where I work.","There is no magical formula for winning a Nobel Prize.","If you go to a second-rate place, and you are first-rate, it is very difficult to do first-rate work because you do not get that critical feedback you need for first-rate work on a daily basis.","I am still the same person doing the same science. Why are people so impressed when some academy in Sweden gives an award?","You can only go into science because you're interested in it.","If I were to take an undergraduate chemistry exam, I would probably fail.","It's not about where you were born or where you come from that makes you a good scientist. What you need are good teachers, co-students, facilities."],"Venus Williams":["I don't focus on what I'm up against. I focus on my goals and I try to ignore the rest.","My first job is big sister and I take that very seriously.","Some people say that I have an attitude- Maybe I do. But I think that you have to. You have to believe in yourself when no one else does- that makes you a winner right there.","I've always found the rain very calming.","Set realistic goals, keep re-evaluating, and be consistent.","The principle of the design - the harmony, rhythm and balance are all the same with interior and fashion design.","I guess rumors are more exciting than the truth.","Everyone makes their own comments. That's how rumors get started.","You have to let fear go. Another lesson is you just have to believe in yourself; you just have to. There's no way around it. No matter how things are stacked against you, you just have to every time.","One who is persistent will excel.","Of course, I want to be number one. But being happy and healthy is the most important thing.","No matter who you are, the grass is never greener on the other side.","Sports are a great place to show that equality can happen.","Interior design is a business of trust.","I'm always in search for perfection. If it's not perfect, I'm back to the drawing board.","You can never get complacent because a loss is always around the corner.","If you look at me, I'm very tall but I'm not huge or muscular. I tend to be slim and you know, I actually can lose weight quicker than I can gain it.","Rain is good for me. I feel like I achieve clarity actually when it rains. The longer I have to sit and wait, the clearer my game becomes to me.","I have a lot of good role models in my family for things off the court - like my older sister, who's a lawyer. I don't like writing papers, but she's helped me a lot. It's nice to have an art and business background because they tie together perfectly.","I eat lots of vegetables and green juices.","I've learned you can always achieve more than you thought you could. There are moments when I've walked off the court, and I'm like, 'I don't know how I won that match.' It was actually impossible, but it happened, and then you realize that you can push yourself much further than you ever thought, and you can make the impossible happen.","I have been recently diagnosed with Sjogren's Syndrome, an autoimmune disease which is an ongoing medical condition that affects my energy level and causes fatigue and joint pain.","Athletes, like everyone else, at times take supplements but just have to consult your doctors and work on that. It's a process, but it's achievable... It's my job to be healthy.","Tennis is mostly mental. Of course, you must have a lot of physical skill, but you can't play tennis well and not be a good thinker. You win or lose the match before you even go out there.","Some people say I have attitude - maybe I do... but I think you have to. You have to believe in yourself when no one else does - that makes you a winner right there.","Understanding that being nervous, having doubts and lacking confidence are emotions that are human is how you deal with it. It is okay to feel that way... and then understanding that you can work through it.","A lot of times, I don't just do juice; I do the whole thing blended to keep the fiber.","After working so hard on the court, I find that snacks help me avoid late-afternoon energy lows.","When you're a big sister, it's a great job. I don't know how little sisters feel about their job, but when you're a big sister, you're supposed to take care of everything. And you feel good about it. I do.","Losses have propelled me to even bigger places, so I understand the importance of losing. You can never get complacent because a loss is always around the corner. It's in any game that you're in - a business game or whatever - you can't get complacent.","I don't snack a lot, because I didn't grow up snacking.","Women's tennis has been around for a very long time - we're talking about the 1800s. But women's soccer hasn't had such a long history, so now they're right at the beginning of really trying to make things equal. We need to continue not only to advocate for women but to have men advocating for women.","I always like to win. But I'm the big sister. I want to make sure she has everything, even if I don't have anything. It's hard. I love her too much. That's what counts.","If the sun comes up, I have a chance.","I want to get better. Every time you lose, you learn from it, and after every win, you look to building on the tempo.","The first time you win, nobody picks you; the last time you win, nobody picks you. You've just got to pick yourself.","Early in the morning, it's super tough for me to eat right away, but I still need energy for practice. I try to start out with a protein smoothie, a green juice, or some sort of fruit.","I knew my destiny was to be in the winner's circle. There were times along the way where I didn't make it there. But I felt my destiny was definitely to win big titles, win lots of titles.","I tend to be slim and you know, I actually can lose weight quicker than I can gain it.","Sometimes when you're making more errors you want to pull back, but I just need to keep going forward.","Life's a challenge, but that's the best part.","The first rounds of a tournament are always tricky because playing tennis takes a lot out of you.","The thing about tennis is if you stay off for two weeks, or just for three days, you can lose your rhythm quickly. So it's just a question of constant diligence and vigilance.","I'm this overachiever type, I'll just work and work and I'll just do it over and over and over again.","If you're not a competitor, you've just got to go home.","I think I've been fortunate to be at the top of the game and in the media for years, and a lot of times, people want to be your friend when you're on the top. You know, there have been times when I've been injured and I never got a phone call. So that's the way it is.","For years I felt that I didn't have enough stamina and then, four years ago, I felt like I was not getting enough air but I was diagnosed with exercise-induced asthma. The medicine for asthma never worked.","Unfortunately the world is what it is now. People don't get along for whatever reason. As professional athletes, in a way we're almost ambassadors for peace, because sports brings everyone together.","In the sports arena I would say there is nothing like training and preparation. You have to train your mind as much as your body.","I'm only seeing tennis balls these days. And maybe the occasional fashion sketch.","I say accessorize, accessorize, accessorize. If you don't accessorize, someone else will.","I don't carry a purse when I fly because I have my Hello Kitty carry-on. I'm the biggest adult supporter.","I just try to stay positive and focused on the tennis, not let anything get to me, like crazy questions. But I'm tough, let me tell you, tough as nails.","Sometimes women who are taller aren't comfortable with it, but I love being tall.","Growing up, I'd just be at home, playing tennis, spending my allowance on an ice-cream truck.","Equality for men and women, across the world, not only in sports, is the goal. We obviously have a long way to go, but every little bit helps.","I was a teenager with braces and into sporty dresses with bright colors and cut-outs. For awhile, I really experimented with what I wanted to do. Some really extreme things, I recall.","When I play my match, I can't think about anything else except what I'm doing on my side of the net.","Self-doubt is real. Everyone has it. Having confidence and losing confidence is real, too, and everyone has been in that position.","I don't even know what my favourite food is anymore, as they are all such bad foods!","I love the food in Thailand because of the exotic spices they use. Their style of cooking is unique to their culture and always amazing.","My motto has always been that you can't say, 'Oh, it won't happen to me.' You have to say, 'That can happen to me.' So always be aware that things can happen.","I don't have time for easy. Tennis is just hard.","My mom didn't want us to go to the candy house, she didn't want us to go to the ice cream truck, she didn't want us to go to the... There was actually a donut truck, if that makes sense.","When you are in the public eye, you have to protect yourself. There are so many people judging you. I just try to be myself.","As long as we set up equality, we'll go in the right direction.","The most challenging thing is people do see me as a tennis player, but I've had a lot of opportunities because I am a tennis player. And I don't mind that.","I'd like to imagine that in order to beat me a person would have to play almost perfect tennis.","When you lose, you're more motivated. When you win, you fail to see your mistakes and probably no one can tell you anything.","When you're on top, you're on top.","It wasn't like I was self-motivated. My dad started me. It was his dream before it was mine.","I don't come to tournaments to make friends, to go to parties, to hold conversations. I come to be the best, and I'm not mean and cruel and dirty.","As far as everyone else's opinion, I mean, if I would have thought that everyone was right, I probably wouldn't have left Compton, so I don't get too caught up on what the next person thinks.","Grand Slam losses are hard. I treat myself after losses though, I usually go to McDonald's and I have a hamburger and you know, something. Because you know, you just need to be nice to yourself sometimes after the loss.","Sjogren's is something you live with your whole life. The good news for me is now I know what's happening after spending years not knowing... I feel like I can get better and move on.","The big push for me is the Olympics this year. If I'm healthy, I'm not worried about my ranking. I think I can hit the ball. It's just about my body cooperating. It's about being able to play matches in a row. Right now, I'm not sure how much I can do with that, but we'll see.","Right now, I'm at the top of the world in my game so my focus isn't on when I'm going to end. My focus is on playing the best tennis that I can, and there is no end to that.","It's what I've trained for, from the first sketch to the fabric. Making dresses that are different from the usual style, and a lot of fun to wear."],"Vera Brittain":["I know one husband and wife who, whatever the official reasons given to the court for the break up of their marriage, were really divorced because the husband believed that nobody ought to read while he was talking and the wife that nobody ought to talk while she was reading.","Meek wifehood is no part of my profession; I am your friend, but never your possession.","Politics are usually the executive expression of human immaturity.","There is an abiding beauty which may be appreciated by those who will see things as they are and who will ask for no reward except to see."],"Vera Farmiga":["I love Saturday nights with my best friend and a big bowl of pasta, wanting a good scare, something that will say, 'Listen, your life is not as bad as this. Your life can be so much worse.'","Sometimes I attract roles that are necessary either for personal growth or enlightenment.","In these times, in this harsh, rude, warring world that we live in, where most of the bloodshed is 'My god is greater than your god,' and we're fighting in the name of our god, we have to find a way to peaceably coexist, spiritually.","I'm part wood nymph. I require mountains and warm, dense patches of moss to thrive.","There are women who make things better, there are women who change things, there are women who make things happen, who make a difference. I want to be one of those women.","Doubt is the middle position between knowledge and ignorance. It encompasses cynicism but also genuine questioning.","I look for struggle in the roles I choose - struggle and perseverance.","I think all religions can agree on certain definitions of God and concepts of God, like God being the god of love, the great 'I am' energy.","We are all seekers in some way. There are those of us who think they have all the answers and there are those of us who may never get an answer.","We're all sick of holy wars and bloodshed because religion is supposed to give us life and a better life and is supposed to bring out our best self. When it results in mass destruction and hatred and anxiety, it's the antithesis I think of what religion was designed to do.","I think I always try to be accommodating and open and available and proving for my director. I love to give as many takes as they want. I love to give them as many choices as they want.","I just can't feel lukewarm about a character. I either despise her, admire her, or don't understand her and want to understand her.","I think maybe I was a shepherdess in a past life.","I chase after inspiring stories.","I've always believed that if you are precise in your thoughts, it's not the lines you say that are important - it's what exists between the lines. What I'm compelled by most is that transparency of thought, what is left unspoken.","The limelight is a tricky place, because you can't believe what's going on around you. You stop observing. You stop perceiving. You stop extending yourself, and you become isolated.","I don't have a caustic sense of humor. What I find funny, that humor comes from a much gentler place.","I grew up in a Ukrainian Catholic-turned-Christian household, and that is my family's faith.","My father instilled in me - of utmost importance and innate in me is the yearning to determine for myself - to define God, to define holiness for myself.","I have the best husband a wife could possibly have. He's the best father my children could have.","You don't have to be gay to be attracted to your friend.","Faith is important to me.","I'm just someone who marvels at God.","I've played a lot of mothers in my movies.","I come from a massive family, and the youngest is twentysomething years younger than I am, so I grew up with children.","It's true: I don't remember what life was like before parenthood.","Offers come all the time, but I'm pretty particular. I really have to be wowed by a character I encounter in a script, or a storyline. I really do need to feel inspiration, otherwise I'm just happy planting perennials and making goat cheese.","There really are three types of 'religious' movies: the ones that make fun of it, the ones that vilify it and the ones that literally preach to the converted.","I've never felt the breath of God - you can take that statement literally or metaphorically - more than when I was yearning for a personal, intimate connection to something bigger than me.","Someone once told me that religion is like a knife: You can stab someone with it, or you can slice bread with it.","I just hate one-dimensional portrayals of religion; it's too cheap and easy to do, and ignores the nuances that go into having a belief system.","Whether we call it religion or faith, we all battle for a balanced integrated soul.","Editing is not a part of the filmmaking process I've ever been privy to as an actress.","Editing yourself is like an irksome coin toss. You've got to strip yourself of super ego and operate from the id. Maybe I've got my Freud mixed up. It's just hard to trade a beauty shot for the performance with truth and a brightly lit zit.","Normally, I rely heavily on my director to massage me out of my actor comfort zones.","Ruminants are a perfectly normal thing to possess when you live in upstate New York. It's just moving scenery. It's kind of like the equivalent of Great Danes. It's the way you keep your grass mowed. It's the way you keep your weed-whacking to a minimum.","It's a very different thing, religion and faith. Religion is man-made, it's man-regulated. And faith, you can define God as you wish. But I think they're two different things.","Working with children is a whole other ball game. They're like little animals. You have to keep the camera turned on them all the time. Sometimes it takes a 41-minute take to get one sentence out in a believable way.","I hate being manipulated by song. Don't tell me what I should be feeling. I don't want cellos or violins to be telling me that I should be bawling right now.","There's no wrong way to experience a film.","In the quiet moments, the discoveries are made.","As an actor, you're sort of the court-appointed lawyer for the character.","I've never graced the cover of a fashion magazine.","You ought to have a perspective when you're making a film.","I'm from the school of, 'if you want more, you have to require more from yourself.'","You earn very little money on independent films and I'm the provider for my home, so I do have to think of taking one for the accountant time and again and that means studio pictures.","I can't get my knickers in a twist about my age and ageing in an industry that caters to the ids of 14-year-olds.","Whether you're making a million dollar film or a $100 million film there is never enough money, there's never enough time.","I don't necessarily need Hollywood.","I think that films about faith made for faith-based communities have a certain tactic.","I'm saying that the depth of exploration of the male psyche and the female psyche is uneven. I see further, deeper renderings of what it means to be a man.","Do I pray? Yes. Prayer is very important to me.","You don't necessarily have to be religious to pray.","Your soul either feels lifted by something that you read, or it feels squashed by it.","I think God gave us senses of humor, and we should use them.","When I look at female characters, I want to recognize myself in them: my trials, my tribulations as a mother, as a lover, as a daughter.","There are some times when I think acting can be a noble profession. And when those rare roles come along, like 'Down to the Bone,' you have the opportunity to be of service.","I think the worst thing that can happen to a good actor is fame.","I, for one, am tired of seeing movies about men damaging each other.","The Ukrainian community is tight-knit by nature.","Am I ambitious? I used to be afraid of that word but now I think ambition is a good thing.","The more people know about you, the more face-time you get in the media, the harder your job becomes to create a character in whom people suspend disbelief.","Honestly, I think a good film is spiritual, regardless of whether its subject is faith.","My only real advice to Oscar nominees is, 'If you haven't actually seen a competitor's film, don't fib and say you have and blow smoke up their wahooziewhatsits.' Always best to be frank and tell them the truth.","I'm hooked on Polanski's films, his psychological thrillers. I love 'Rosemary's Baby,' I love 'Repulsion.'","The biggest research of all when I do a character is self-examination. You look at yourself and you ask, 'How am I similar to this person and how am I different?'","I love to be surprised.","I have tender, romantic associations with upstate New York.","I didn't grow up watching film but as a Ukrainian-American, music and stories and dance are crucial.","I am drawn to intimate, often uncomfortable portraits of a woman persevering and awakening.","We take a lot for granted as second wave feminists, what our mothers and aunts did for us.","I was a Ukrainian folk dancer in my teens, and I toured the country in 1991, shortly before the break-up of the Soviet Union.","Music is what our feelings sound like."],"Vera Miles":["I couldn't kill a fly.","I love young men, lots of them, your ancient masculine double standard."],"Vera Rubin":["Science progresses best when observations force us to alter our preconceptions.","Does Sex Matter? Of course it does. But does it matter enough to Matter? That's a different question.","No observational problem will not be solved by more data."],"Vera Wang":["My evening really begins when I take a long, hot bath. I light a candle, and I turn on the news and try to catch up. It's when I can breathe from the day to the night, and that means a lot to me.","Success isn't about the end result, it's about what you learn along the way.","When you have a passion for something then you tend not only to be better at it, but you work harder at it too.","My bedroom is my sanctuary. It's like a refuge, and it's where I do a fair amount of designing - at least conceptually, if not literally.","When I design a wedding dress with a bustle, it has to be one the bride can dance in. I love the idea that something is practical and still looks great.","The key is falling in love with something, anything. If your heart's attached to it, then your mind will be attached to it.","I've been designing since I was 8. I started sketching dresses I could wear when skating. I was always involved in all aspects of skating, not just the technique, the choreography, the music, but the visual aspects, too - what I should wear.","My mother was extremely controlled, sort of flawless. And I always tend to be a bit more hippie.","The great thing about having a pool in L.A. is that I can use it year-round. And since I've always been an athlete, staying fit is very important.","A woman is never sexier than when she is comfortable in her clothes.","I adore the challenge of creating truly modern clothes, where a woman's personality and sense of self are revealed. I want people to see the dress, but focus on the woman.","Don't be afraid to take time to learn. It's good to work for other people. I worked for others for 20 years. They paid me to learn.","It takes tremendous will to compete in any athletic endeavor, so it meant going to bed early and getting my homework done in advance. I had to sacrifice things, like a social life, to be a skater at 15. But I loved skating so much that it was worth everything to me.","There was no relationship between a wedding dress and fashion. There was no good taste, either. I realized that I could make an impression in terms of changing and readdressing the whole industry of bridal.","I like the gritty parts of fashion, the design, the studio, the pictures.","Even the most understated ceremony involves a certain respect for ritual and pageantry. No one plays more of a significant role than the bride's attendants.","I see myself as a true modernist. Even when I do a traditional gown, I give it a modern twist. I go to the past for research. I need to know what came before so I can break the rules.","I work with structure, but I go outside the box and give it my own spin. I adore the challenge of creating truly modern clothes - where a woman's personality and sense of style are realized.","To me, eyewear goes way beyond being a prescription. It's like makeup. It's the most incredible accessory. The shape of a frame or the color of lenses can change your whole appearance.","I was the girl who nobody thought would ever get married. I was going to be a fashion nun the rest of my life. There are generations of them, those fashion nuns, living, eating, breathing clothes.","All those years of skating and dancing have carried over. I can't design anything without thinking of how a woman's body will look and move when she's wearing it.","I always see where I didn't do things the right way. I only see the heavy lifting. That's a bit of my wisdom, if you want to call it that.","It's hard to balance everything. It's always challenging.","I see myself as an arbiter of taste.","My normal routine is pretty much putting out fires all day.","I make things of my own that aren't that glam, but I'm not known for that, which has always been a bit of a frustration for me.","Although in skating you compete with other people, anyone who achieves a certain level of success is first and foremost competing against themselves. And for me, the idea that I could always do better, learn more, learn faster, is something that came from skating.","When I decided to get married at 40, I couldn't find a dress with the modernity or sophistication I wanted. That's when I saw the opportunity for a wedding gown business.","The funny thing is that I'm the girl who no one sees at the beach. Ask anyone who's traveled with me. Normally, I'm in so many layers, I look like Lawrence of Arabia!","Design is about point of view, and there should be some sort of woman or lifestyle or attitude in one's head as a designer. So my being able to reach the masses was something that meant a great deal to me - especially for women who could never wear Vera Wang.","All I did my first year at Vogue was Xerox.","As the mother of two daughters, I have great respect for women. And I don't ever want to lose that.","Fashion offers no greater challenge than finding what works for night without looking like you are wearing a costume.","I wanted to define the vocabulary of a wedding both visually and intellectually. The book is about more than weddings or wedding dresses. It's a metaphor for women's lives, their creativity.","It's a remarkable exercise to sit and look at your own work over the years.","It's for all the women who embrace my aesthetic, but can't afford a Vera Wang dress. If women can get anything out of it - a little bit of me or a lot of me, that's what's important.","I don't live through my kids. But I do know what will happen in life, and I just want them well prepared.","I was trying to manage school and training for the Olympics and ended up not doing well at either. That was a big lesson in my life. My mother expected both.","I started at the very highest level so the upper end is something I know very well. I know it instinctively. But all the years I was designing, it frustrated me that I could reach so few women.","Design is about point of view, and there should be some sort of woman or lifestyle or attitude in one's head as a designer.","People get very trapped where they are. When they hear 'fashion' they get intimidated, particularly at the upper end because it's so elitist.","Although in skating you compete with other people, anyone who achieves a certain level of success is first and foremost competing against themselves. And for me the idea that I could always do better, learn more, learn faster, is something that came from skating. But I carried that with me for the rest of my life.","New York for me is about work. If L.A. were to become a West Coast version of that, I'd shoot myself. The climate, the lifestyle - it really fits as the yin to my New York yang.","I'm not really a girl who likes to go out to lunch or cocktails or store openings.","I do think I know more about clothes than any 500 designers, because there's nothing like wearing them. You buy them, you study them, and you start to understand how they're crafted.","Fashion to me has become very disposable; I wanted to get back to craft, to clothes that could last.","Just because you're from a city ten miles outside of St. Paul. It doesn't mean you don't read magazines, or the incredible Internet, and what's going on in the world. I never, ever take a client, or women, for granted.","Let's be realistic, how many people are buying a $2,000 skirt? I love to design things that people can actually buy. I'm staggered by what a boot costs today.","I'm only waiting for Lindsay Lohan's fashion collection to come out. Ten years from now, there may be no real designers left.","It is horrible to say, but I was stigmatized by being a bridal designer for a long time. I am amazed I have been able to move beyond it. I had really all but given up trying, but I did it because it was my lifelong dream.","They never ask the celebrities why they don't wear their own clothes on the red carpet.","It's hard to juggle being a businessperson with being a creative person. You have to organize yourself - PR needs me for PR, and the licensing division needs me for licensing, the bridal people need me for bridal.","I hate phones. All businesses are personal businesses, and I always try my best to get back to people, but sometimes the barrage of calls is so enormous that if I just answered calls I would do nothing else.","Brides today are increasingly sensitive to the tastes, feelings and finances of their attendants.","I am not the sort of woman who would wear high heels with a bathing suit. Let's get that straight right now.","I love a black wedding dress.","If I were to say at any point that I feel really confident or really in control, that would be a mistake. Because I don't. I always see where I didn't do things the right way.","That was a major goal for me - to be able to reach and encourage more women, to encourage them to express themselves and be what they want to be. People get very trapped where they are.","I do speak Mandarin, and I also relate to the hunger that China has for culture and architecture and style.","Figure skating has been a great influence for me. I took dance at the School of American Ballet, which helped my own skating. And whether you are a skater or a dancer, without sounding narcissistic, it is all about looking in the mirror.","I was a total fashion insider who became an outsider when I did bridal.","My mother is the reason I'm in fashion. She worshiped it. Unfortunately, she infected me.","I love to design things that people can actually buy. I'm staggered by what a boot costs today.","Things that came before, people and things and experiences - that does mean something to me. It doesn't mean I don't embrace the new, but I don't forget the past, either.","I was an art history major, but never specifically contemporary. I would say where I really stopped were the abstract expressionists in the New York school.","I've always tried to push myself technically and to push myself visually. That's been part of the journey.","I love sportswear in my own weird way. Fashion is such a personal journey for me. I'm much more of a girl that's a T-shirt, legging, layering kind of thing, and outerwear.","I'm a late riser by my family's standards. Sleeping is a luxury because since I was young, I woke up very early to go ice-skating. So I'm really not a morning girl.","I wear Rick Owens T-shirts to bed. They are like my thermals, since I sleep with the room at near freezing temperatures, like a meat locker.","My closet is organized by tops, pants, and outerwear, but not a lot of dresses. Gowns are in another room because I don't often dress formally, even though I design gowns. Like most designers, I have a uniform, and mine is a legging."],"Verite":["When I was 16 or 17, I started listening to Death Cab, and I started writing my own songs. I was writing alternative rock, and I had a seven-piece band. The shift was just iterations of experimentation and finding what sounded right. When I stumbled on the sound and vibe that I currently have, it was kind of by chance.","I don't wear a lot of color because I live in New York, and I'm sort of color-blind, so colors don't match to me a lot of the times, and it makes me anxious. So I'll always defer back to black.","I hyper-analyze everything; I'm always in my head. Those moments where you don't think and you're just part of the environment did not come easily to me, but it was those moments and highs that I chased.","A lot of my music has ambiguity and room for people to interpret.","If I'm happy with what I'm putting out and proud of it - that is becoming enough for me. It's testing myself, but I'm ready to do it, whereas I wasn't ready before. Sometimes it's feigned confidence, but if I make a decision, I can do anything.","I started when I was really young. I was playing with my dad when I was 8 or 9, and I started playing shows then. I had a short stint in a DIY all-girl punk cover band.","Back in the day, I was definitely a child of alternative radio.","Sometimes, you're going 24 hours a day, seven days a week for a few months, and then you come home, and you wonder what you're doing with your life and why. At least, that's the experience I've had.","I started writing music with my cousin at, like, 16 and traveled with a '70s band.","I want to have a career in 10, 20 years, so it's harder now, and maybe more stressful now, but in the future, hopefully it will all pay off.","If anything, I'm the most hesitant to bring on a label. That terrifies me. I think people believe major labels are linked to success. They're absolutely not that.","I constantly compare myself to artists who have, like, 10 times the budget I do. My mind is the biggest challenge, honestly.","I was joking with someone about this the other day. They were like, 'You talk about Applebee's as if it was your ex.' I miss it; I miss setting up tables at 6 A.M.","When it comes to production and the overall sound, I don't really have a lot of intentions with it. I start off with melody and a lyrical idea, and then build off of that story.","School was just kind of something where it was like, 'Um, I guess I should get my bachelor's.' My mind is always geared towards the practical.","I have to recognize that my voice is attached to my body, which gets tired.","I love spreadsheets. I do all the finances. I pay the publicists. I have to compartmentalize the creative and the business, so there are sacrifices. But ultimately, I get to be the CEO of my own business.","I started Verite on savings from three years working at Applebee's in Times Square. I was a ridiculously good waitress. I was making more money than my brother, who worked at a start-up.","I'm not very good at vacationing or relaxing or planning any of that for myself. So I'm in the habit of piggy-backing off of gigs and deciding to stay an extra day.","I moved to New York when I was 21 and worked between 40 and 70 hours a week. Then I invested it all. It was really just a hustle. But I was kind of raised to work like that, so to me, it seemed very normal and natural.","I used to play shows in D.C. and then drive back to New York to work at 6 A.M. So there are those moments, and you just really need to power through them. Eventually, it builds on itself.","I want to be in control of how my music is released and how I create it. What people don't talk about when they talk about major labels is how many artists get dropped or funding gets dropped when they don't recoup quick enough.","I'm disregarding all the rules I've seen as people approach writing music. I'm trying to break them.","When you do acoustic shows, there's always a more intimate vibe. I go into them with lowered expectations and assume that people don't want to hear me.","I want to be an arena act. There's so many steps to take to get there, and it's so easy to get lost and cocky. I just take small steps each day.","I want to write weirder stuff and convince people that it's Top 40."],"Vern Buchanan":["My kids have played sports all their life, and one thing I've tried to teach them when you lose, you try to be a gentleman about it.","Anytime you have a tight race and you lose, it's not pleasant.","I'm going to reach out to everybody, Democrat, Republican and independent. I'm going to work with all the people in the district, and whether they're an 'R' or a 'D' doesn't matter."],"Verne Troyer":["Doing stunt work is risky, but it's something I enjoy.","There's nobody else that can double me - except for a doll.","What I really enjoy the most is seeing what the crowd likes. I enjoy making people laugh.","I can play the leading man. I can play the action hero, maybe in just a different way. I look at it as, you know, if you set your mind to it, you can do it.","I still pinch myself that I ended up in Hollywood. And I am still surprised at the fans.","In Men in Black, it was a very small character, no pun intended.","I just take it one day at a time. Austin Powers has given me a lot of opportunities as far as my career.","We were doing the dance routine and I dislocated my knee. I've been doing stunts for a long time and it's kind of weird that I'd dislocate my knee just dancing.","Now I get to pick and choose exactly what I want to do.","Me being able to beat up Austin Powers? I mean, how great can that be?","The Amish like to live a very plain lifestyle, the way they think God intended. It sort of brings you back to, like, 'Little House on the Prairie' days or something.","There's times when you're having dinner with a good friend and you're in the middle of a conversation and somebody comes up and cuts you off. Can you sign this? Can I take a picture with you? I'm adjusting to all the attention.","People have a good time with all the catch phrases.","I felt probably more uncomfortable than Beyonce. But I can't answer for her.","It's hard for me to even watch comedies I'm in.","I think when average-size people start taking roles that were meant for dwarfs, that's a little frustrating because there aren't that many roles out there for height-challenged actors.","In the film, I'm not very mobile, like in the space suit.","In high school and college all my friends and my brother wrestled.","If I did everything, I probably wouldn't be here talking to you. There aren't too many people who can actually double me, so I do most of my stunts though.","I've done approximately 15 films, and most of the things I've done have either been stunt or costume work.","I'm a big sports fan. College football is my favorite.","I'll be one of the Who's of Whoville.","I went to see the film with a regular audience for the first time on Sunday, and was basically swamped.","I was just the perfect person to play the Mini-Me character.","I think it was a good challenge for me to get my reactions across without being able to speak.","I grew up in Michigan, in a very small town, Centreville. In my graduating class, I had like 92 people.","I stay away from the elf roles; I stay away from playing a leprechaun. All the roles I try to do are something that an average actor would do.","I love London. I would move here. I like British people; everybody is so down to earth.","L.A. is so fake - girls there are so superficial.","I was working at a candy-wrapping factory before I became an actor. I admit I snuck some hard candy, which is great because you can suck on it while you're working."],"Vernon A. Walters":["I don't think we should tell them what we're going to do in advance. Let them think. Worry. Wonder. Uncertainty is the most chilling thing of all.","Americans have always had an ambivalent attitude toward intelligence. When they feel threatened, they want a lot of it, and when they don't, they regard the whole thing as somewhat immoral.","The United Nations has become a place where many countries seek to achieve a lynching of the United States by resolution.","It is an endless procession of surprises. The expected rarely occurs and never in the expected manner.","I'm a participant in the doctrine of constructive ambiguity."],"Vernon Duke":["Well we really meant you to visit Paris in May, but the rhythm required two syllables.","Autumn in New York, why does it seem so inviting?"],"Vernon Howard":["A truly strong person does not need the approval of others any more than a lion needs the approval of sheep.","What you really want for yourself is always trying to break through, just as a cooling breeze flows through an open window on a hot day. Your part is to open the windows of your mind.","Humanity appreciates truth about as much as a squirrel appreciates silver.","The great solution to all human problems is individual inner transformation.","A certain number of people seek power over other people in a desperate attempt to find themselves. They fail, for self-discovery is spiritual in nature, not social or political. Authoritatively telling other people what to do is their distraction from an inner emptiness they can never fill.","Truth never pleads or compromises or wavers. It invites and awaits your acceptance.","What most men call their conscience is imaginary virtue switching left or right according to self-interest.","Learn to see a problem from a higher level of understanding. Then, it dissolves before your eyes.","Your friends will be as careless with your life as they are with their own.","Never fear to deliberately walk through dark places, for that is how you reach the light on the other side.","The best way to start doing something is to start doing something.","It is a true miracle when a man finally sees himself as his only opposition.","Start your day in a upward direction, and the rest of the day will follow the uphill path.","Truth is not a matter of personal viewpoint.","Evil is an attack against human spiritual development and enlightenment. All evil, badness, neurosis - it has one motive and one motive only, which is to destroy - to destroy your chance of arising above yourself.","To change what you get, you must change who you are.","Whatever you want, you have the power to attain it. The man or woman who calmly and matter-of-factly accepts this pronouncement at face value will soon find himself working magical accomplishments far beyond that which he previously dreamed possible.","Some folks hesitate to seize additional strength because they think it wrong or dangerous to be a powerful individual. Somehow they have acquired the false notion that tyranny or dictatorship or cruelty are the outcomes of a powerful personality. These characteristics are not power. They are weaknesses disguised as power.","Our freedom can be measured by the number of things we can walk away from.","We are enslaved by anything we do not consciously see. We are freed by conscious perception.","For every problem or confusion and for every desire or ambition there is an available force waiting for your call.","The following terms all mean one and the same thing: God, goodness, mental health, truth, decency, happiness, freedom, reality, peace, love, sensibleness.","Just be honest with yourself. That opens the door.","Personal power gives you a sense of accomplishment. It enables you to live fully and zestfully. It provides you with a mature reason for liking yourself better. To state it another way, it is the mark of a healthy and well-adjusted individual to seek self-advancement by mastering his human relations.","Make it your profitable habit to carefully study facial expressions. You can see the entire human drama in a face; you can tell its owner's history.","Tell a man that he is putting on a stage performance in order to get what he wants, and he will irritably reject your observation. Why? Because most people go through life as cunning actors with a permanent horror of getting found out.","In order to reach home, where you have the guidance of cosmic insight, you must first depart from your present location. You cannot remain in the noisy city of your own vanities and expect to know what to do. Cosmic knowledge and personal vanity do not mingle.","Beauty is only skin deep, but it's a valuable asset if you're poor or haven't any sense.","You have succeeded in life when all you really want is only what you really need.","We are exactly where we have chosen to be.","Problems are cured by facing their cause.","Quit thinking that you must halt before the barrier of inner negativity. You need not. You can crash through... whatever we see a negative state, that is where we can destroy it.","We must become acquainted with our emotional household: we must see our feelings as they actually are, not as we assume they are. This breaks their hypnotic and damaging hold on us.","Freedom begins as we become conscious of it.","We clearly realize that freedom's inner kingdom cannot be touched by exterior attacks.","Learn to see things as they really are, not as we imagine they are.","All forms of self-defeating behavior are unseen and unconscious, which is why their existence is denied.","Can you think of anything more permanently elating than to know that you are on the right road at last?","A clear understanding of negative emotions dismisses them.","Study carefully the law of cause and effect.","Remember above all that mental stability comes by examining the contents of the mind, not by avoidence.","We are slaves to whatever we don't understand.","The fact is, everything we want or yearn for is won through other people. No man on an island is happy; he is merely existing. The joyous life is the one filled with rich relationships.","Make it absolutely clear to yourself what you want from other people. That is really half the secret for drawing your desire to you in the shortest possible time and with the least amount of effort.","People appreciate and follow the person who can persuade them properly. Make that person you.","Do not resist a new idea. Be quietly receptive. Go along with it, even unwillingly at first. Sooner or later, it will reveal itself as your ally.","Question the motives of those who make requests of you. Discover what they really want. You may not want to give it.","It is not the strong who are dangerous to the world and to themselves. It is the weak and the inadequate who threaten - and sometimes destroy - mankind's peace and prosperity.","Evil wants you to think that its power is absolute, endless. It wants to so make you quake and quiver that all you'll do is fall down and worship it.","You are not condemned for anything, but you are also not excused from anything. See these two ideas together at the same time, and a powerful third force for self-awakening is created.","Remember that cosmic fact and mental myth cannot occupy the same place at the same time, any more than two hands can occupy the same glove. So choose what is truly right for you.","We must get to the point in our lives. What is the point? To become a new kind of man or woman, having inner command and outer excellence.","You can't come into this world without becoming its victim.","When you're young, you don't have much sense. You don't have any reasoning power. You don't have any ability to take a blow, an insult, a hurt in the right way. There is no way a child can do that. All a child can do is feel the pang of it, the heartache of it."],"Vernon Jordan":["I had a sense of what leadership meant and what it could do for you. So am I surprised that I am sitting up here on the 62nd floor of Rockefeller Plaza? No.","But there will come a time and a place to give back, and each individual will recognize that time and place.","My mother was the president of the PTA at every school I attended.","Every company, every boardroom in which I sit, has a plan, and they have objectives, goals, and a process. And to make it work, the pressure and incentive have to come from the top.","A lot of companies make diversity a part of the performance goals against which an executive gets paid. Just as you have to make a certain sales number, you have to make a diversity number to get your bonus.","You have to be careful how you're using the word boycott.","I'm here because I stand on many, many shoulders, and that's true of every black person I know who has achieved.","September 11 stands on its own as a terrible tragedy.","Terrorism is not new to black people.","The last job I applied for was to be a bus driver for the Chicago Transit Authority in 1957.","What I know about this world is that white people will take care of themselves. And what I have learned is that if you are where they are on an equal basis, they cannot take care of themselves without taking care of you."],"Vernon L. Smith":["Yes, long hours and a hard life for my parents, but for a six to seven year old every new day dawned with fresh excitement when you have not a care in the world, and so much to learn and witness.","I can still memory - taste the fresh buttermilk pancakes and hot buttermilk biscuits - both made with lard! - that were cooked on the top, or in the oven, of that ancient iron stove.","After my stellar first grade academic achievements, I continued to perform well in the city primary schools - except for penmanship, which was not my forte.","In the 9th grade I began my first wage work for the West Side Drug store delivering prescriptions and sundries on my bicycle to customers who called in orders.","I still have my original social security card signed when I was 13.","In 1941 I finished at Allison Intermediate School (grades 7-9), and started at North High School, commuting by bicycle about 5 miles from home to school.","Caltech was a meat grinder like I could never have imagined.","After graduating in engineering I went to the University of Kansas to get an MA in economics as a vehicle for allowing me to decide if I wanted to continue in economics.","I gradually became persuaded that the subjects, without intending to, had revealed to me a basic truth about markets that was foreign to the literature of economics."],"Vernon Law":["Experience is a hard teacher because she gives the test first, the lesson afterward.","Some people are so busy learning the tricks of the trade that they never learn the trade."],"Vernon Lee":["The greatest pleasure of reading consists in re-reading.","There is too little courtship in the world."],"Vernon Wells":["I think I'm a guy who loves to play defense. I have a great time in the outfield. I think it's fun robbing guys on hits - there are plenty of times you're gonna be robbed as a hitter.","There's a fine line between playing through things and sitting out. I was always on the side of, 'I'm going to play through it.' It's probably good at times, bad at times, but for an athlete to always try to be there and play through things, from a teammate's perspective, it speaks volumes. Now that I look back, mentally it makes you tougher.","You're going to fail. It's how you respond to that failure that kind of defines you as a person, as an athlete.","I got to the big leagues when I was 20. I thought I had it all figured out. Went to spring training that next year and started off well, got sent down, and I pouted pretty much all of 2000. And it wasn't the right way to handle it.","If I could go the ballpark and play the game for three hours and then go home? It would be awesome. But that's not the case.","I never lose confidence. As soon as you lose confidence, you're done.","If I'm going to wind up playing left, I want to be the best left fielder in the game. I'll work to be that.","My dad was a designer for Upper Deck, and I had hundreds of Ken Griffey Jr. cards. Hundreds. I could have paid for college with them.","You get caught up in hitting home runs and seeing how far you can hit them, and your swing changes.","I think hitting's just repetition. The more you hit, the better you're gonna get.","I keep a lot of things inside. I don't like showing too much emotion. Early in the minor leagues, they wanted me to show more emotion, but it wasn't me.","I guess my name was gonna be Michael Vernon Wells, and I came out, and my dad saw my nose. He always says that my nose right now is the same size as it was when I was born. So he had to name me Vernon. He's got a big schnozz on him, too.","As hitters, I think we take for granted at times how good our hands are and just how much the value of truly getting the barrel to the ball is. We don't have to do as much as we think we have to.","I remember the first time I played the triple-A Yankees when I was 20 years old, and Darryl Strawberry was on that team. It was the first time I actually got goose bumps playing against another team.","I think you start hitting home runs, and you start getting caught up in seeing how far you can hit them. They're fun, but you really only have to hit them a foot over the fence. They all count the same.","I've played in Boston and New York, and it doesn't matter if you're sick, aching - once you step on that field, you're a completely different animal."],"Vernor Vinge":["Even the largest avalanche is triggered by small things.","Animals can adapt to problems and make inventions, but often no faster than natural selection can do its work - the world acts as its own simulator in the case of natural selection.","Within thirty years, we will have the technological means to create superhuman intelligence.","The physical extinction of the human race is one possibility.","I argue in this paper that we are on the edge of change comparable to the rise of human life on Earth.","How will the approach of the Singularity spread across the human world view?","But every time our ability to access information and to communicate it to others is improved, in some sense we have achieved an increase over natural intelligence.","It is a point where our old models must be discarded and a new reality rules.","The dilemma felt by science fiction writers will be perceived in other creative endeavors.","Another symptom of progress toward the Singularity: ideas themselves should spread ever faster, and even the most radical will quickly become commonplace.","The work that is truly productive is the domain of a steadily smaller and more elite fraction of humanity.","When I began writing science fiction in the middle '60s, it seemed very easy to find ideas that took decades to percolate into the cultural consciousness; now the lead time seems more like eighteen months.","And for all my rampant technological optimism, sometimes I think I'd be more comfortable if I were regarding these transcendental events from one thousand years remove... instead of twenty.","In fact, there was general agreement that minds can exist on nonbiological substrates and that algorithms are of central importance to the existence of minds.","But if the technological Singularity can happen, it will.","I have argued above that we cannot prevent the Singularity, that its coming is an inevitable consequence of the humans' natural competitiveness and the possibilities inherent in technology.","When people speak of creating superhumanly intelligent beings, they are usually imagining an AI project.","IA is something that is proceeding very naturally, in most cases not even recognized by its developers for what it is.","Note that I am not proposing that AI research be ignored or less funded.","I am suggesting that we recognize that in network and interface research there is something as profound (and potential wild) as Artificial Intelligence.","We humans have millions of years of evolutionary baggage that makes us regard competition in a deadly light.","The problem is not simply that the Singularity represents the passing of humankind from center stage, but that it contradicts our most deeply held notions of being."],"Veronica Cartwright":["No one ever bugged Jack Nicholson. When we made 'Witches,' and people were standing around to see him, he'd just come out and say, 'Hi everybody!' I was lucky enough to go with him to a Lakers game, too, and he was always friendly. No one bothers Jack, because he makes himself so accessible.","There was a period of time when I couldn't seem to get anything. I was on the series 'Daniel Boone,' and then, when that ended, I was still under 18, so I was too young to be in the older category and too old to be a child. So there was a few years there that were dry.","Why push people away? I love when people come up to me and say they appreciate the work!"],"Veronica Franco":["Women have not yet realized the cowardice that resides, for if they should decide to do so, they would be able to fight you until death; and to prove that I speak the truth, amongst so many women, I will be the first to act, setting an example for them to follow.","Such a gift might be easily taken back again.","I wish it were not a sin to have liked it so.","When we too are armed and trained, we can convince men that we have hands, feet, and a heart like yours;."],"Veronica Lake":["I've reached a point in my life where it's the little things that matter... I was always a rebel and probably could have got much farther had I changed my attitude. But when you think about it, I got pretty far without changing attitudes. I'm happier with that.","I wasn't a sex symbol, I was a sex zombie.","You could put all the talent I had into your left eye and still not suffer from impaired vision."],"Veronica Roth":["In my own relationships, I know that I should break up with someone who doesn't encourage me to be strong and make my own choices and do what's best in my life, so if you're dating someone who doesn't want you to be the best person you can be, you shouldn't be dating them.","Maybe it's a little depressing to think that my vision of a perfect world is actually so messed up, but I think it means that I don't really understand what 'perfect' is.","As a teenager, I put a lot of pressure on myself, and a lot of that, for me, was about finding a moral high ground. As I've grown up, I've decided to abandon that because it made me judgmental and also stressed me out.","I think it's fascinating to look at a world that an author has created that has sort of stemmed from the world now, and usually dystopian books point out something about our current world and exaggerates a tendency or a belief.","If you actually succeed in creating a utopia, you've created a world without conflict, in which everything is perfect. And if there's no conflict, there are no stories worth telling - or reading!","When you're a teenager, everything seems like the end of the world, and I don't think that's necessarily a silly thing. You're waking up and becoming aware that the world has problems and those problems affect you, whereas when you're young they don't seem to affect you that much even if you're aware of them.","There's really no way to be perfect. Perfectionism is a silly trait to have, so in a lot of ways that inspired the world of 'Divergent,' in which everyone is striving toward that ideal and falling short of it.","When you're a writer, you hear your internal critic, and that's really hard to get over. And then sometimes you hear critiques from classmates and stuff. But when a book comes out, it's just hundreds of opinions and you have to learn to separate out the ones you want to listen to or figure out many you want to listen to.","'Divergent' was my utopian world. I mean, that wasn't the plan. I never even set out to write dystopian fiction, that's just what I had when I was finished. At the beginning, I was just writing about a place I found interesting and a character with a compelling story, and as I began to build the world, I realized that it was my utopia.","I always appreciate people's opinions, but sometimes I have to take a step back and remember why I'm writing and what I want to do with it. Shutting out the voices is difficult but it's been good for me.","It's not that I ever sat down and outlined a trilogy, but I always have a sense of what size an idea is when I start it.","I think everyone's a little afraid of being part of a trend, because you get compared to each other. Writers tend to have a lot of camaraderie, and when you're constantly compared to someone else, it kind of damages that camaraderie, but I think this is a great trend. I'm honored to be a part of it in many ways.","I think it's a human tendency that's been around for a while to try to be as good as possible to prove your worth.","I really like the group tour better than going it alone. First of all, it kind of takes the pressure off a little. I'm not a naturally extroverted person. But I also like it because it brings in new fans. For example, someone who really loves Aprilynne Pike's books might pick up mine and vice versa.","People make me key chains... someone attached a Dauntless symbol to a silver pen. That one is what I use to sign books. I use that a lot. I like to keep them around because they remind me that people are waiting for these books and that they really love them. It gives me motivation in those times when I'm not feeling very motivated.","I don't really think about what's 'age appropriate' for my audience because I think they can handle quite a bit, but I do try to think about what's honest and true to my characters who have grown up in situations where they've been taught to handle these things very carefully and that they're very powerful.","I know exactly what it's like to stand on top of a tall building or in a high place and look down and go, 'Ohhhh my God.' I try to get into that place every time I write a scene like that. And definitely when I write the action scenes, I get overheated and my heart goes really fast. I get very involved.","I love 'Harry Potter.' I'm a huge nerd - I would dress up if I could.","I want people to come away from my book with questions. Questions about virtue and goodness. Not answers.","Seeing people who are actually reading your book and listening to the wide variety of reactions they have to it, is really special.","If utopian fiction became the new trend, I wouldn't read it."],"Veronica Webb":["One of the things that fascinated me about modeling was that you had the freedom to look any way you wanted.","For me, it works to my advantage when people think I'm stupid. If somebody who disdains you or wants to control you underestimates you, you can play their game right back.","I came to running late. It was something I had always wanted to do, but I always end up getting hurt. It didn't occur to me that I could actually slow down and walk a little bit!","I wanted to try marathon running, but something always came up: I had a baby and a C-section or I got injured or I just didn't think I could run that far.","My eating is pretty consistent. I like Greek yogurt for breakfast. I eat two giant salads a day, a broiled meat or fish, and a dark green vegetable at every meal.","I have very, very few friends. I live in a very tight circle and emotionally I'm probably not as generous as I once was. In an average week I probably meet 150 new people and that's uncomfortable sometimes.","My parents were both in the army for 20 years and then worked in government departments; but they had gone through the Great Depression and known lean times. They always remained extremely frugal and lived far below their means."],"Veruschka von Lehndorff":["In the Sixties, fashion was about liberation. It was about setting women free; it wasn't about being unable to walk.","Fame, I mean, it's like a bubble, in a way. It's like something glittery, and it goes, and it can be forgotten fast.","My parents led this double life. They were in the underground movement to bring down the Nazis. My father was hanged for being a traitor.","It has not been hard to grow older, because I believe if you have something you believe in, that will keep you alive far more than plastic surgery or Botox.","I know that there are many things I could do, but I'm not interested. It's more important to be loving and to have a lively mind."],"Vesta Williams":["I guess I was always a ham, and I was anxious to try doing different things. I started doing impressions to make friends at school. I would do them during recess. Maybe some of the kids thought I was being weird, but everyone seemed to have a good time.","When I lost my record deal, and my phone wasn't ringing, I realized that I had to reassess who Vesta was and figure out what was going wrong. I knew it wasn't my singing ability. So it had to be that I was expendable because I didn't have the right look.","I've always felt that to deliver a song successfully, you have to be an actress. A good actress becomes the part, just as a good singer becomes the song.","A lot of people have called me the black Bette Midler, and I regard that as a compliment.","Don't you dare print my first name. That would make me sound like a real country girl.","According to my grandmother, I started singing as soon as I began talking. I always wanted to be an entertainer. I knew that from the start."],"Vic Fuentes":["Sometimes I feel like there are just too many things weighing on my mind at once, and I can't control my thoughts or even my body at times.","When I'm writing, I separate from everyone. Even my band. I push myself, and I'm alone with my thoughts. Separating from friends and comforts and family lets you think a lot deeper about subject matter. Working alone drives me a little crazy, but it makes the writing as honest as possible.","Equal Vision seems to be doing really well. A lot of these major labels are just imploding and becoming indie labels, anyway.","I went to Mission Bay High School. Me and my brother, we both went there.","Growing up in San Diego, I can remember going with my brother to see bands like Pennywise and NOFX - good punk bands that were fast and tight.","It's all about risk-taking when you're making an album. Don't be scared to do weird things sometimes."],"Vic Mignogna":["There is no question that knowing someone in the business will get you in the door. But it is your skill that will keep you in the room.","Be where the acting is. I live in Houston. Dallas is 4 1/2 hours away. I let them know there's no difference.","Your connections might get you in the door, but it won't keep you there. And if you haven't prepared, you'll suck."],"Vic Morrow":["Because we are in a war situation, this can sometimes be dangerous work. But guys like A.D. Flowers and his technicians just take it in stride and get on with the job. In four years, we've never had a serious accident or injury working with all the explosions.","Then you'd have found me pinned beneath a large metal pipe.","Last summer a second unit production crew went to France and shot scenes for several of this season's episodes. They shot costumed actors in and around real castles and landmarks, we couldn't possibly have duplicated here in Hollywood.","You're a hundred percent correct about our show being tops in quality.","I think we've shot scenes from every angle directors can think of to make it look like different villages. I've directed a couple shows on that set and believe me, it's impossible not to duplicate some camera angles.","So, it looks like we rebuild the village and blow it apart a few more times.","Each show comes with its own set of problems to work through.","I don't like to direct myself.","I haven't seen the show, but when it was finished I felt good about what we had done. I don't know how it will stack up with Survival, but that'll be up to the critics.","Stories come from other shows at other studios where only 2,000 rounds were actually used and the money for the other 3,000 went right into the studio pockets. Corners were cut and that production suffered. Knock wood, that hasn't happened to us.","Our cast and crew strive for this show after show hard as they can. It shows in the finished product."],"Vic Snyder":["The 1957 crisis in Little Rock, brought about by the desegregation of Little Rock Central High School, was a huge part of the march toward freedom and opportunity in America.","The trip to Iraq confirmed that I made the right decision when I voted against lending Iraq the $18 billion the United States plans to use to help rebuild the country.","It is important to note that there are no age limitations on who can donate organs and tissue. Newborns as well as senior citizens have been organ donors.","Unfortunately, our history has abundant examples of patriotism being used to hurt those who express views in disagreement with that of the majority.","If you eat something and get fat, you should be responsible for it. I think that is the attitude of the great majority of Americans, that you should be responsible for what you eat."],"Vic Tayback":["My character at 'Mel's diner' was involved in betting on the horses and all that.","If I walked into a restaurant, the other diners would look around and say, 'I hope you're not cooking.'","I tell young actors to do anything that will sustain them.","Too many actors get on an ego trip and won't do commercials, so they sit around for 20 years between jobs."],"Vic Willis":["Don't believe those tales you hear about my being all-in. Wait until you see me in action for your team and then form your opinion of my worth to your team.

Adam ate the apple.","I part of this great nation because my grandfather was born here, in Cincinnati, Ohio. He took a horse, back in 1895, and ride it all the way down to Guanajuato, looking for his American dream. No penny in his pocket, only dreams in his head. And he was an immigrant coming from the States into Mexico. And he found his American dream in Mexico.","Instead of building walls, we should be building bridges.","We need to be aware of what we are capable of first and realize that if you place your dreams really really high, you do have the potential to get to that level.","I think there's a big misunderstanding on the value of migrants.","The real end winner of NAFTA is going to be Mexico because we have the human capital. We have that resource that is vital to the success of the U.S. economy.","What nourishes us at home and in school is what inspires us. When we get awareness and learn about the great potential that we all human beings have, we are able to discover our leadership.","Change will not come from above, it will come from below, from the small and medium size businesspeople. They do dare to show their faces. They applaud us and help us financially.","We must put together countries that produce drugs, countries that traffic, and countries that consume, and through this multilateral effort really stop the growing of crime.","To me, governing is communicating. That facilitates the whole job because I can listen, I can hear what people have to say, and at the same time I can let them know what are we working on, what is our strategic line, and where are we going.","As long as they are working, they should be legalized. I admire so much each and every migrant. They are the most loyal workers in the U.S. economy. They build the homes of those who are attacking them.","I mean, we must act with intelligence. We must work on this framework, so that immigration becomes an asset to both nations. Believe me, what - just the Mayor Bloomberg said here in New York, that this city would be stopped, totally stopped if it were not by the immigrants working here.","I am the guardian of power, not its owner.","We are a nation in which freedom is alive in the squares and streets, in the daily work of the communications media, in the open relationship between the governing and the governed.","We would betray Mexicans' hopes for change if we felt satisfied with what we've accomplished so far.","You may count on Mexico's support, since your commitment to the noblest causes of mankind and your vast experience are and will be invaluable in enabling us, together, to achieve a better world.","I have decided to fight for my country, because we have build a success story in Guanajuato, with real results and more yet to come in the next two years.","At the very end, what is going to happen is that immigration will be reduced considerably. And how can we get to that stage? By agreements on sectors.","I believe Mexico should dedicate 100% of its oil revenues to developing human capital and technological development. None of us politicians should be able to touch that money.","I think it's very important that the United States keeps out of the local electoral process in Mexico.","Mexico doesn't deserve what has happened to us. A democratic change is urgent, a change that will permit us to stop being a loser country.","Our number one priority is to spend every peso possible to include those who are currently excluded.","There's no doubt that Mexican men and women full of dignity, willpower and a capacity for work are doing the work that not even blacks want to do in the United States.","Tourism is a top priority activity for federal government, which is why it invests an average of over 2,500 million dollars a year in infrastructure works and integral projects that promote Mexico's culture and natural attractions.","I should say many things. Mexico has been one of the losers of the 20th century. We tried many different alternatives to development and unfortunately we have 40 percent of the population poor; we have a per capita income that is extremely low.","Mexico is the only country in the world that has a trade agreement with United States and Canada, and at the same time has one with Europe. These are the two largest markets in the world. By the same token, Mexico has one of the most open economies.","The job of president is to motivate, to inspire, to be side by side with people making sure that they develop all their capacities and that I remove all the obstacles they have to grow by themselves.","No doubt I enjoy being close to people in the way I dress, the way I speak, and the way I communicate with people.","First, to begin with, Mexico is North American; the one that is using wrong the term is United States. United States is not North America. North America is Mexico, United States, and Canada.","What Mexicans want and aspire to, is to go there and work temporarily and raise some money and come back home. That's what they want, so nobody's asking for those two, three million Mexicans that are illegally in the United States to become American citizens.","President Obama is committed to Hispanics and migrants.","Always, in every human action, there are leaders.","There are people that go ahead, that see problems before the rest, that take decisions before the rest.","Every idea has its time.","I think that in Mexico, we must change some practices that were built during the 72 years of predominance in Mexico. Former presidents would just hide away, run away or disappear. And I think it's key in a democracy that presidents face people, see eye to eye to citizens and work to keep on contributing to the - to Mexico.","Usually Mexico, or always Mexico has defended itself and its territory.","Let me tell you that I love the United States.","By dedicating so much concentration to the issue of security, bilateral matters pass to a secondary level.","I believe that work can be done on security; in combating terrorism in Mexico we have done our part in this area. But at the same time, the world must continue working.","On one side, citizens have great respect for the United States; they have a great feeling of friendship. That is solid. But in the opposition and in the political arena I often find criticism of the closeness of relations with the United States. That is a reality.","I am an honest person, transparent, that look citizens straight in their faces.","Fortunately, I have money that's from my life's work. But it's money that I share and used greatly to fight poverty in my country.","Obama is thoroughly mixed up with all these things he's got. He's got to solve Libya. He's got to solve Afghanistan. He's everywhere. And this nation, I don't know why it's not showing the leadership and capacity to attend different issues at the same time.","The army should go back to their assigned duties, and police should take the responsibility of fighting the cartels.","So if Arizona sees the federal government isn't assuming its responsibilities, it creates local laws. But migration and keeping security on the borders is not a local or state issue, it's a federal issue.","If we can put together a Mexican businessman and a U.S. businessman, they will find a way to do more business.","We are not going to build a pressure in Mexico. We're not building walls to retain our people.","And I like to convey my feelings, my emotions, my experience, the information I have to public use, public opinion.","I think one purpose is very clear among corporations and business leaders: make profits, deliver high return for stockholders, conquer markets, service consumers and create jobs. But in today's world, demands from corporations and leaders are much more than that. We need to understand what people really want at the very end."],"Vicente del Bosque":["A leader is admired, a boss is feared.","Football has an important role to play in society. Players should have a sense of social responsibility, have a moral dimension to them which shows up in good conduct.","We are in a world that is quite extremist and extremism makes more noise. Normality does not sell.","Leadership must be likeable, affable, cordial, and above all emotional. The fashion of authoritarian leadership is gone. Football is about life. You can't be angry all day.","I didn't really want to be the coach who wins but the coach who educates.","We must look after football and to do what it is necessary to bring to the game the best ethical values and personal behaviour.","I just wanted to defend football, which is not always easy to do. Those of us who have been in the sport so many years now realise we must protect it and look after it. I was speaking about football, what it means. It is our profession, it has been our lives, and we must take care of it a little.","Sometimes people say that coach is a winner, but everyone wants to win. You must know how to behave in victory and in defeat, to look after what is our sport, football.","I realised that the political context had got worse since the 2010 World Cup. I tried to ignore it but I wanted, as a national coach - you may call this Utopia - to make Catalans and Basques feel good about supporting a Spanish side... to unite even the most sectarian and nationalist.","Spain used to be very individualistic in its sporting activities. Now we are showing we are pretty good in teams - that is an improvement.","No one knows anything about economics. It's the great lie of the economists. By contrast in football people might have contrasting opinions, each of which has some validity. But the economists always speak in conditionals - what a mess.","As with Cesc Fabregas, some players who go and play for foreign clubs improve on a cultural level. It makes them grow on many levels; intellectually, because you have to learn a new language and adapt to another culture, and on a footballing level too.","I think it is important to help our country's image outside of Spain.","The Confederations Cup is interesting. It served Spain very well to take part and then go on to win the 2010 World Cup. We knew the stadiums, the atmosphere, the conditions and also the difficulties of a tournament which simulated the World Cup format.","The certainty that our football, the football of Spain, is recognised, that's very important to us - perhaps more important than the successes and the joy that you can create. Football hasn't always been appreciated, and luckily our football is appreciated now, at all levels of society."],"Vicki Baum":["You don't get ulcers from what you eat.

We would fly into a hospital and serve mess to the guys, and we ate whatever they were eating. Then we slept there and flew out the next day to little bases where there were maybe 10 or 20 guys. Then we flew to another hospital.","I love to cook. I'm a sailor. And I was the eighth-grade ping-pong champion.","I played Miley Cyrus' grandma on 'Hannah Montana,' and the first time I was on, they said, 'We love having veterans like you on because she's like a little sponge, and she's really appreciative of all the veterans that are coming on the show, and we just love that you're teaching her.'","It's just kinda what I did: played crazy old ladies.","I definitely go with the flow because I feel like I have been so lucky, and so many things have happened to me that just never should have happened.","Everyone has a crazy old lady in their family like 'Mama.' No one ever comes up to me and says 'Mama' is just like them, so no one is ever offended by her. Even young people like to laugh at her. I think she helps kids appreciate their own grandmothers more.","When I hosted 'Win, Lose or Draw,' it was always fascinating to me that no one knew where anything was when they had to draw a destination.","That's my opportunity to hide behind that old lady and say what I want to say.","The fun part for me is to just really push that envelope.","Things have always sort of happened for me. Something else always comes up.","I often feel like I could fall off the face of the Earth. As long as 'Mama' was around, nobody would really miss me. People really think of her as an actual person. People all the time see me and ask, 'Where's Mama?' Like she should be with me.","I always tell people I went to the Harvard School of Comedy in front of America.","I didn't plan on going into show business. Show business picked me. And it's been fun. One of the best things about being in show business is people think they know me, and they feel like they grew up with me.","I was married for 10 minutes into a Southern family.","I feel like my life has been very serendipitous and really kind of humorous. Everything that's happened to me has been like an, 'Omigod, are you kidding me?'","I never intended to be in show business; I intended to be an extremely grounded person.","I went to UCLA, my dad's alma mater, and that was his dream.","Even though I was in close proximity to everything, it never really dawned on me to pursue a career in show business.","I do love pasta. It gets me into trouble. If I could give up pasta and bread, I'd look like Cate Blanchett.","I think the older you get, the more 'let's cut to the chase' you get, 'let's quit quibbling about this, let's tell it like it is.'","Everybody just told me from the day I went into high school that I looked like Carol Burnett.","I think for people that are dealing with this out there, the important thing to know is that this is real. It's called CIU, and there are solutions out there for you.","I go out and speak to women's groups all the time, and I say, 'Guys, you gotta laugh and find the humor in things. You gotta pass it on.'","We all know him: everybody has an Archie Bunker in their family, so you love to laugh at him, and you never take it personally; everybody just has a ball laughing at him.","I flew to New York to do a commercial back in the day when people could meet you at the gate, and the little agent when I came off the plane said, 'Oh, Miss Carr, we are so happy to have you here.' I went, 'Oh, for goodness sakes.'","People would get Carol Burnett and Vicki Lawrence all mushed together in their brains, and, bless their hearts, it would come out Carol Lawrence.","I don't get people baring their lives on television. Maybe it makes other people feel better about themselves. Is that what it is? You watch these people making total fools of themselves. It's like there's absolutely no privacy.","Everybody has a dysfunctional family.","I think it is a universal problem that we are so often cruel to the people we love.","A lot of the things that loved ones say to each other, friends would never accept.","I think coming East and doing something like Broadway would probably be a good career move.","This country wants to laugh. We want to, and we need to. I'm happy to oblige.","I'm very particular about what I want.","I really am a cockeyed optimist.","My parents raised me to believe that when one door slams in your face, turn around because there's probably another door opening up somewhere.","Anybody who has spent time with the networks - in fact, you don't even have to spend time with the networks, all you have to do is just watch primetime TV - and you think, 'What the hell are they doing? I could run the network better.' And I think everybody feels that way.","I think it's time for people to stop being so serious about everything.","I really feel my family is my priority.","Yes, I love playing Mom.","TV's been good to me.","Most of the cast and crew on 'Mama's Family' have been together since the 'Carol Burnett' days, so we work really well together. It's like I'm being paid to pretend I'm in show business.","There's going to be a picture of 'Mama' on my obit.","Making people laugh is what I really enjoy.","My favorite game shows were 'Password' and '$25,000 Pyramid.'","Dick Clark and I had such a hysterical relationship with each other.","Mama is my chance to be a stand-up comedian. In my mind, it's my chance to be Chris Rock.","When I was in high school, in my generation, I thought that you got a logical, sensible job, or you got married.","I think the Mama people remember is from 'Mama's Family.' She really turned into a pretty cool character. The sketches from the 'Burnett' show, if people are old enough to remember, were written by writers who all hated their mothers.","Some talk shows have become so exploitive and tabloid, I wonder if I can believe some of their guests. Where do they find these guests, and why do they deserve air time?","I think I'm pretty average. Typical.","There's nobody telling Oprah what to do. There's no one telling David Letterman what he can and can't do. You've got to have 100 percent support from everybody who's behind the show, across the board.","When the opportunity came along to do 'Win, Lose or Draw,' I took it selfishly to find out if I did enjoy being me on camera. And I did that for the last two years I was doing 'Mama's Family.'","What I learned was that celebrities come to me with a preconceived notion. They think I'm fun, or they've worked with me, or they know me, or we've met. So there's a lot of backstuff on the 'Vicki!' show.","It took me a lot of years on the 'Burnett' show to feel like I had earned the privilege to play in the sandbox with the grown-ups.","The thing that everybody loves about the 'Burnett Show' was that you felt like you were really there - all that fun stuff stayed in the show, and I think that's why everybody remembers it so fondly because that just doesn't happen anymore on television.","I think the audience keeps it fresh for me. You just never know - every audience has its own personality.","Everyone has fond memories of 'The Carol Burnett Show' and the characters we did.","'Mama's Family' was kind of like everyone's guilty pleasure.","I much prefer doing comedy. I get a little paranoid when the audience is not laughing.","It's special to have people see you and tell you, 'You make me laugh.' That makes me feel good. I think if you have the talent to do it, it's your duty to pass it on.","Harvey Korman was like a private tutor to me. He was such a mentor.","I had a hit talk show. I just wasn't working for the right people.","My fans were probably the most therapeutic thing for me.","I don't know how anyone could stop working.","I don't care about making a fool of myself on stage anymore. I don't care what people think.","I was trying to be Mary Tyler Moore. I loved her in 'The Dick Van Dyke Show.'","I was really a shy kid.","I've been at it since 1967, and I still love it. There is nothing quite like making people laugh.","It's always good to play tennis with a better player to bring out the best in you.","I am no prude, but when I watch comedy, I ask myself, 'Who wrote this? A teenage boy in the locker room?'","When I started on the 'Burnett' show, I was just out of high school, and when we went off the air, I was 28 years old, married with two kids. At that point I felt I really wanted to be mommy to my children. But I found that after a year and a half, I really missed the part of myself that was an actress.","When you've got kids, you turn into Mom, and that's it.","I found that I need to work, and I wouldn't have known that if I hadn't taken the time off.","My dad planned a road trip every summer, so we always did the road trip. We did the Eastern Seaboard and learned about the history of the United States."],"Vicky Hartzler":["This election could come down to just a handful of votes. It could come down to just one vote.","I mean, if someone asked for my birth certificate, I'd get my baby book and hand it out and say 'Here it is.'","I think the main thing we can do, whether you agree or not, I don't think that's the real issue, the real issue is this November and there's an election.","A woman should have the right to carry a gun.","Now in business we do a cost benefit analysis before we make policy changes. Washington should as well.","I was able to promote a strong defense budget when it could have been cut a lot more severely.","We do participate in the government programs, like probably 95 percent of farmers do. People who aren't familiar with the agriculture industry, you know, try and make that look like something exceptional.","I don't think that any political party should claim Jesus as being a part of a political party.","I believe that President Obama is here for a reason, but that doesn't mean that he has to stay there next year. The American people have an opportunity to have a say and so I think we just have to do what we think is right - and see what the outcome is. God's got a plan."],"Vicky Krieps":["I grew up wearing trousers and climbing trees.","I've been a waitress for events, but a lady at the Victoria hotel in Yorkshire showed me how to do it properly.","Many relationships can become difficult, and it can be hard to find a way back.","When I was 26, I got pregnant. I decided to have the baby because I accept everything in life as an adventure. I accept life. I couldn't see why you would not accept it.","When I got pregnant, I knew I wasn't anywhere in my career, that I had not arrived. I was still on my adventure, and so I said to the child in my belly, 'I am so happy for you to come, but you should know I'm still on my way, and you'll have to come with me and be in my rucksack.'","I have such strong beliefs. No money or anything could change that.","I am always open to when someone says, 'Let's do it this way.'","I do feel that I myself wouldn't have had, in my life looking back, the courage to go out and say, 'I'm a good actress.' So I think I'm one of those people that needed to be seen by someone else to see myself.","I don't really enjoy being the center of attention; I find it hard.","I don't call myself a method actor, but the thing is, when you meet Reynolds Woodcock, who is always Reynolds Woodcock, you kind of are Alma, and you kind of become Alma all the time. I think after the first day, Vicky was going, 'Oh gosh.' It was so intense, and I couldn't understand why it was so intense.","I often have the feeling that acting is really not difficult, because all I do is I just listen. I just listen. I just listen to what there is. And if there's nothing, then I listen to nothing. If there's a chair, and it's empty, I listen to an empty chair, and I will respond to it.","I wasn't a girl who grew up wearing dresses, but I was always attracted to fabric. When we'd go to a shop, the fabric I'd pick was always the most expensive. It was always the silk or cashmere. It was something in me, that desire to choose quality. It's the same now.","I found meditation. It was more out of pure desperation: I just started to wake up at 5 and sit for one hour, and suddenly, day after day, piece by piece, I could really feel I was coming back into me.","I'm always interested in projects. Whatever I do, I'm interested in the color of the material. I'm not interested in who's making it. I'm more concentrated on the work.","Sexuality isn't something you create. It is between people, and then it just happens.","I think women are strong, and they have never been weak.","In order to make Alma innocent and open, I had to forget that I'm stressed as an actress because I'm making a film with Paul Thomas Anderson. I had to let go of everything and hold onto the text. The language was like a rope I could cling onto and make my way blindfolded through the shooting.","Love for your work, love for another person, love for yourself - love is a huge pond, and it's never empty. You can go and take from it, and it will give you strength.","The way I grew up, I had hippie parents, and we would run around the garden with no shoes on, very close to nature. So I never wore little princess dresses. I still have this feeling whenever I wear a very formal dress; I always have this slight fear that people will point their fingers at me and laugh: 'Vicky is trying to look like a lady.'","The more I'm here in L.A. talking to people, the more I believe that what I've been doing is right, and that's the belief that you have to judge a role from the character, by the script.","Whenever money is in the game, it can suffocate anything and anyone else, and I think people have been misled by money, or the dream of money, or selling the dream that if you've made it money-wise, you've made a life. Which is a lie. You don't get happiness by money.","Whenever you make someone dependent on your money... It's this capitalist idea that I think has made America into a place where it's hard to breathe as an individual sometimes.","For me, the costume is very important. More the feel of it than the look of it. I take it more from the inside. So if I wear something that's heavy, it will affect my character. Is it very tight, and do I feel almost imprisoned, or is it very comfortable? It's the feeling of the costume that tells me where to go with the character.","I made a movie in Germany called 'The Chambermaid' - it was very, very small. I think it cost €70,000 to make. I even put some money in and raised some money for it. It was real German arthouse... It goes, somehow, out there on the Internet, and it goes on iTunes.","Every good love story is actually completely insane, completely mad.","When I act, I act with my skin.","Actors actually have a feeling, like a sixth sense. They are like mediums. But it only works - you can only become this medium or this vessel to transport emotions and images and feelings - if you are not too full of yourself. Otherwise, there wouldn't be space for a story to live inside of you or a world to evolve in you and around you.","I was definitely in acting class in school, but I was never the princess of the play. I will always remember: they always gave me the part of the gypsy or the old man in the corner.","It seemed too glamorous to me to be an actress like in the movies.","I didn't know what acting school was, so I went onto the computer and typed 'acting school.' I found one in Berlin, and I found ones in Vienna, Zurich, and London. I went to all of those places to audition. You were supposed to have two monologues, and I only had one.","It was like putting your foot into a pond and knowing that I wanted to dive into this. It wasn't even just acting. It was this medium, film. I had to explore it.","In German, if a situation is tense, you say 'unter strom' - under electricity.","For me, couture is like 35 mm. film. It's so important we school ourselves to see real quality. In a couture garment, as in a 35 mm. film, you really feel the life of the people who made it. In high-street fashion, it's different. There's no risk.","I thought maybe I should write or study law. I even had the idea to open a flower shop. But I was so fascinated with film, I couldn't stay away.","In my family, people become pregnant at 33 or something, not 26.","I didn't have the courage to let myself think or dream of acting because I come from Luxembourg - it's a very small country, and I think it's a place you need to get away from to see how big the world is and what's possible.","I stood in front of a mountain and was overwhelmed by the beauty and energy; I had goosebumps. I thought, if I could record this feeling, go back home and pour it out again so other people can have that feeling, this I would want to be my work. I knew it was acting - I wanted to be like a messenger or medium.","I never had a plan; I always follow my intuition.","Love cannot be defined, caught, cast in stone, or archived. It's something we have no control over. Love is completely analog. Love can never be digital.","You can give into a relationship and warmth and the arms of another person.","You want to be a good mother, and you want to be a good actress, and you want to be a good friend, and we expect this of us, to be all of this.","I meet a person as the person. I try to not give away who they are or who they're supposed to be.","I'm very proudly European. I love that we have stories to tell of a place where we come from and we can relate to.","I love how complicated we are. We are complicated because of what we've had and lived.","I don't believe in borders, I find them boring. And I don't see any difference between any person."],"Vicky McClure":["I'm not slim. I'm a curvy girl: I've got thighs and a bum. I don't mind baring the fact that I've got a bit of cellulite because everybody has. I find it off-putting when everybody on telly is the same size or looks the same build. For me, it's important for people to watch someone normal.","I just feel like I'm such a normal person in an industry that is so chaotic and crazy. I am what I am, and I can't change it. And I don't want to change it.","I've always been a happy-go-lucky person. I haven't got any dark tales, I didn't draw on my own past, I'm from a very normal stable background and had an amazing childhood, and I haven't got any complaints really.","I get to have Sunday lunch at my mum's, pick my nephew up from school now and then: it's a very normal life.","If you have a passion and love for something, it's hard to give it up. I had jobs where the people were helpful and let me go to auditions, and I'd make up the hours another day. I was lucky in that respect: I could afford to get to London.","It is Method on 'This is England;' it is. But it can't be Method on every job because it just doesn't work for everything.","Eventually I just want to live a normal life. I want to get married and have children and cook, wash... all the things that I do now. My background is very normal and steady, and that's what I like.","Yes, I certainly look for strong characters - whether that means they're strong in their vulnerability or strong in the way they might be attractive to lots of blokes.","A journalist can make or break a case, in a way, because they can figure out things the police can't, or they can destroy people's lives.","My first job ever was on 'Peak Practice.' I just had to walk up the stairs. They kept the take where I slipped slightly, which was annoying.","Oh, I love Nottingham. I know some people go, 'Oh God, there's not much going off there,' but I like staying in and going round to my mum and dad's for a Sunday roast.","If Madonna asks anybody to go and hang out with them for a month, they'd all do it.","I don't need a trailer; I don't need to have the luxuries of what is Hollywood, which is why I'm probably not so desperate to get there.","I'm strong. I like to mother people, look after people. I lead the gang.","I know that people who have been to RADA and LAMDA can smash accents and do Shakespeare: all those things that I never really trained in.","When I watch cop shows, I really enjoy them because you can really follow the story and get involved, and the characters are always really interesting.","I'd like to do something where there's a strong female character and some action. I've done a few stunts in the past.","I danced from the age of three, so I was always going to do something performance-related. I got into the Television Workshop drama group in Nottingham when I was 11 and went there for ten years.","There are lots of people who haven't been to drama school who have great talent and can be discovered."],"Victor Borge":["Laughter is the closest distance between two people.","Humor is something that thrives between man's aspirations and his limitations. There is more logic in humor than in anything else. Because, you see, humor is truth.","The difference between a violin and a viola is that a viola burns longer.","I don't mind going back to daylight saving time. With inflation, the hour will be the only thing I've saved all year.","I wish to thank my parents for making it all possible... and I wish to thank my children for making it necessary.","I only know two pieces; one is 'Clair de Lune' and the other one isn't.","If I have caused just one person to wipe away a tear of laughter, that's my reward.","Santa Claus has the right idea - visit people only once a year.","He was happily married - but his wife wasn't.","When an opera star sings her head off, she usually improves her appearance.","My father invented a cure for which there was no disease and unfortunately my mother caught it and died of it."],"Victor Cherbuliez":["Half the joy of life is in little things taken on the run... but let us keep our hearts young and our eyes open that nothing worth our while shall escape us.","What helps luck is a habit of watching for opportunities, of having a patient but restless mind, of sacrificing one's ease or vanity, or uniting a love of detail to foresight, and of passing through hard times bravely and cheerfully."],"Victor Cousin":["All men have an equal right to the free development of their faculties; they have an equal right to the impartial protection of the state; but it is not true, it is against all the laws of reason and equity, it is against the eternal nature of things.","All truly historical peoples have an idea they must realize, and when they have sufficiently exploited it at home, they export it, in a certain way, by war; they make it tour the world.","Ignorance is the primary source of all misery and vice.","The beautiful cannot be the way to what is useful, or to what is good, or to what is holy; it leads only to itself.","True philosophy invents nothing; it merely establishes and describes what is."],"Victor Cruz":["I never dreamed about being a millionaire - I dreamed about being a football player.","It was definitely some tough moments throughout my life, but I kind of stayed focused and came through the other end of the tunnel.","I've had the same barber since I was about 14 years old.","My mom and my father's birthday are on the same day.","My mom lived by herself with two kids. Sacrifice was the name of the game at our house.","Every step, whether at high school or at college or at the NFL, I had to climb and crawl and scratch to get there.","There's only one life. There's no repeats. You only get one life, and you gotta take advantage of it.","I'm focused on football; focused on my family right now.","In the city, a lot of crime happens, a lot of violence happens from time to time.","Growing up in Paterson wasn't the easiest thing.","I didn't have outstanding numbers coming out of college and I'm not 6'6 with 230 lbs.","I don't need any nicknames.","I kinda wanted to play receiver more.","I can just sense some eyes, some people kinda stare a little bit like they recognize me but don't quite know for sure kinda thing.","I always have to have a six pack or twelve pack of Entenmann's doughnuts in my house, no other brand.","My first year of college was tough. I thought that just being an athlete I could get by. I thought I was okay until I got kicked out, which happened twice.","I was always the type of person that whenever I started something I finished it. And, I was always held accountable for my actions.","My mom was dying for me to write a book, she was my biggest advocate.","I definitely want to teach my daughter Spanish.","I couldn't care less about what anybody else has to say.","I want to win championships.","I just want to continue to play football and be myself.","I want to win football games.","At the end of the day, there are people out there that want to see you fail.","You have to think about your image and how you want people to view you. And if it becomes too much, people will get kind of tired of you.","I knew what type of player I was: a free agent, a small kid who came from a small school.","I want to be a New York Giant for a very long time.","Never in a million years would I think I'd play in a Super Bowl.","Some guys just slip under the radar.","Football was what I was good at, and it was what I loved.","I was actually a Cowboys fan.","When I was young, it wasn't about the money, it wasn't about the fame and fortune, it was about playing football.","Everybody wants to defeat the defending champs.","It is funny what a year can do.","I just want to continue the success and be an athlete that is shown in a good light in New York City.","I don't want to be on 'Dancing With the Stars' anytime soon.","I was afraid I would see someone from my past who thought I was this big athlete, and then I end up being just normal.","As a kid, my grandma would be dancing all the time.","I don't recognize my former self. Like I'm on the outside looking in at my life. Who is that guy?","There were times when I thought I would never own a car.","There are times where I am trying to make the big play before I even catch the football.","I think I've got some more big plays left in me."],"Victor Davis Hanson":["This bloody past suggests to us that enemies cease hostilities only when they are battered enough to acknowledge that there is no hope in victory - and thus that further resistance means only useless sacrifice.","Americans spend more money on Botox, face lifts and tummy tucks than on the age-old scourges of polio, small pox and malaria.","History has shown that a government's redistribution of shrinking wealth, in preference to a private sector's creation of new sources of it, can prove more destructive than even the most deadly enemy.","Any time the Western way of war can be unleashed on an enemy stupid enough to enter its arena, victory is assured.","States are like people. They do not question the awful status quo until some dramatic event overturns the conventional and lax way of thinking.","The fact is, beneath the hype, Iraqis will soon appreciate American help and idealism far more than French perfidy. It is never wrong to be on the side of freedom - never.","Even in its third century, America is still the most meritocratic nation in the world.","Popular culture is simply a reflection of what the majority seems to want.","In history, one gathers clues like a detective, tries to present an honest account of what most likely happened, and writes a narrative according to what we know and, where we aren't absolutely sure, what might be most likely to have happened, within the generally accepted rules of evidence and sources.","The gradual decline of a society is often a self-induced process of trying to meet ever-expanding appetites, rather than a physical inability to produce past levels of food and fuel, or to maintain adequate defense.","War seems to come out of nowhere, like rust that suddenly pops up on iron after a storm.","Often, the pretexts for starting a war are not real shortages of land, food or fuel, but rather perceptions - like fear, honor and perceived self-interest."],"Victor Francis Hess":["The investigation into the possible effects of cosmic rays on living organisms will also offer great interest.","In order to make further progress, particularly in the field of cosmic rays, it will be necessary to apply all our resources and apparatus simultaneously and side-by-side; an effort which has not yet been made, or at least, only to a limited extent.","The application of a strong magnetic field enables the measurement of the energy of the most penetrating particles to be carried out, and the method may be capable of still further extension and improvement.","Simultaneous recording with superimposed ionization chambers and Wilson chambers, ionization chambers and sets of counting tubes, has not yet been carried out.","On what can we now place our hopes of solving the many riddles which still exist as to the origin and composition of cosmic rays? It must be emphasized here above all that to attain really decisive progress greater funds must be made available.","It may well be said that the answer to the question: Of what do the cosmic rays in fact consist before they produce their familiar secondary radiation phenomena in the earth's atmosphere? can only be obtained from numerous measurements in the stratosphere.","From a consideration of the immense volume of newly discovered facts in the field of physics, especially atomic physics, in recent years it might well appear to the layman that the main problems were already solved and that only more detailed work was necessary."],"Victor Fung":["A multilateral world trade system is our very best hope for addressing the broad range of issues such as market access, tariff and nontariff barriers to trade, trade in services, and trade facilitation.","For the future world-trading regime to mirror economic reality and to allow the use of modern business strategies, we need a single overarching multilateral framework for trade. We can have either a flat world or a patchwork of crisscrossing mountain ranges and tunnels."],"Victor Garber":["Being on a television series is sort of life-altering on every level.","I believe that acting in any medium is the same thing, it's discovering the truth in where you are.","Sometimes his methods are questionable, and even his morals are questionable, but his intention is always to protect Sydney. So in that way I think he's a good parent.","And when I go to see plays, I marvel at how people can do that. I've done it all my life, but I still find it mystical.","I had done some TV movies that were great experiences but, no, I wasn't looking to do a series.","I have no interest in directing. I've no talent for it.","I think from a very young age I always have this desire to perform.","I'm very serious about acting.","If you were to come to the set of Alias, you'd know how silly we all are. And I mean, silly.","My mother couldn't have been happier when I said I was moving to New York.","The hardest thing for me is not to keep laughing. Jennifer particularly is like a clown.","The most sinister aspect of Jack is his detachment, his ability to distance himself from his feelings.","The stage is where I feel most comfortable, and I miss it all the time.","Theatre demands different muscles and different aspects of one's personality.","Then I did one fight scene, and they said it looked good. Because I did it well enough, they've given me more.","When I first read the script a few years ago I thought it was one of the best written scripts I had ever read.","You can only do so much theatre.","You have to find something there that relates to the characters and reality on some level.","I find that everything I do is demanding, like Jack Bristow is a complicated man and I do a lot of explaining in the show, it takes a lot of energy and concentration.","I like the fact that Jack is always wearing a tie except when he's on a mission. I do like it when I get out there and dress up, or dress down, a little bit.","I've been amazed that it's so popular with people. But it's been fantastic. People are very excited when I walk into a place and they recognize me from the series.","In our show you have to pay attention and know what happened before. I think it's very intelligent entertainment. It makes demands of viewers that a lot of shows don't.","It's about these people who are inextricably together for whatever reasons, and they happen to be in the spy world. It's about relationships, and the bottom line is, that's why you care.","It's disgusting that a Broadway show can't try out anymore, that no matter where they are in the world, there is this massive dialogue going on between people damning or praising it.","Sometimes, his methods and his motives are questionable and even his morals are questionable in the way he does things. But I think his intention is always to protect his daughter.","Thank goodness I started getting movie roles and then television shows came along. So I was very fortunate to be able to do all three and I like all of them.","That's why, when Alias came along, I knew I'd be OK if the show was on for five or six years because the writing was so good and the creative team was so strong.","The crew loves working on the show, even though we have to work really hard. There's nobody in the show that's difficult. We really have a great group.","We, some cast members and I, even went on a weekend trip together and spent the weekend at an inn, because we enjoy each other's company so much, and it was so cool.","I find out more about Jack every week. Essentially, I'm the same character, but I'm having more fun this season because I'm doing more aliases, you know. I like the surprise of not knowing.","I remember the first reading of the script we had and everybody was sitting around the table. I was very impressed with the level of acting that was in the room, particularly with Jennifer who has so much responsibility.","One day, we were doing a serious scene and fast talking like we do and we could not stop laughing and the director had to stop the production. We had to go to our trailer and calm down and do it all again.","The first thing I read was of my character on the phone talking to Sydney's fiance. Though short, it was so beautifully written, and it made me laugh. I thought if I wanted to play a character, this would be it.","What I realized was how difficult an hour show is and how miserable you can be if you're not happy doing it."],"Victor Grignard":["There are, in fact, very few organic zinc compounds; only the first members of the series, which correspond to the simplest organic radicals, can be prepared without too much difficulty, but they have the disadvantage of being spontaneously inflammable in air and are consequently very dangerous to handle.","Organic compounds exist in which a hydrogen atom, joined to the carbon, acquires acid properties as a result of the proximity of certain functional groupings.","Whereas, generally speaking, zinc reacts suitably only with the first members of the alkyl iodides, with magnesium it is possible to use bromides, iodides, and in many cases, chlorides.","The reactions of organic magnesium compounds are of two kinds - reactions of substitution and reactions of addition."],"Victor Hugo":["Music expresses that which cannot be said and on which it is impossible to be silent.","Fashions have done more harm than revolutions.","Concision in style, precision in thought, decision in life.","When a woman is talking to you, listen to what she says with her eyes.","A mother's arms are made of tenderness and children sleep soundly in them.","Life is the flower for which love is the honey.","He who opens a school door, closes a prison.","Laughter is the sun that drives winter from the human face.","Intelligence is the wife, imagination is the mistress, memory is the servant.","Perseverance, secret of all triumphs.","Change your opinions, keep to your principles; change your leaves, keep intact your roots.","There is one spectacle grander than the sea, that is the sky; there is one spectacle grander than the sky, that is the interior of the soul.","When dictatorship is a fact, revolution becomes a right.","The mountains, the forest, and the sea, render men savage; they develop the fierce, but yet do not destroy the human.","What would be ugly in a garden constitutes beauty in a mountain.","Forty is the old age of youth; fifty the youth of old age.","When grace is joined with wrinkles, it is adorable.

There is room in the heart for all the affections, as there is room in heaven for all the stars.","Initiative is doing the right thing without being told.","To contemplate is to look at shadows.","How did it happen that their lips came together? How does it happen that birds sing, that snow melts, that the rose unfolds, that the dawn whitens behind the stark shapes of trees on the quivering summit of the hill?

All is well, provided the light returns and the eclipse does not become endless night. Dawn and resurrection are synonymous. The reappearance of the light is the same as the survival of the soul.","All the forces in the world are not so powerful as an idea whose time has come.","We see past time in a telescope and present time in a microscope. Hence the apparent enormities of the present.","I met in the street a very poor young man who was in love. His hat was old, his coat worn, his cloak was out at the elbows, the water passed through his shoes, - and the stars through his soul.","Whenever a man's friends begin to compliment him about looking young, he may be sure that they think he is growing old.","Great perils have this beauty, that they bring to light the fraternity of strangers.","The most powerful symptom of love is a tenderness which becomes at times almost insupportable.","I am an intelligent river which has reflected successively all the banks before which it has flowed by meditating only on the images offered by those changing shores.","Prayer is an august avowal of ignorance.","One is not idle because one is absorbed.

What does that mean? Is there any foreign war? Isn't every war fought between men, between brothers?","Death has its revelations: the great sorrows which open the heart open the mind as well; light comes to us with our grief. As for me, I have faith; I believe in a future life. How could I do otherwise? My daughter was a soul; I saw this soul. I touched it, so to speak.","The ode lives upon the ideal, the epic upon the grandiose, the drama upon the real.","Reaction - a boat which is going against the current but which does not prevent the river from flowing on.","Conscience is God present in man.","To love beauty is to see light.","Nature has made a pebble and a female. The lapidary makes the diamond, and the lover makes the woman.","Love that is not jealous is neither true nor pure.","To love is to act.","Certain thoughts are prayers. There are moments when, whatever be the attitude of the body, the soul is on its knees.","One can resist the invasion of an army but one cannot resist the invasion of ideas.","Life's greatest happiness is to be convinced we are loved.","Society is a republic.

Every bad institution of this world ends by suicide.","In the French language, there is a great gulf between prose and poetry; in English, there is hardly any difference. It is a splendid privilege of the great literary languages Greek, Latin, and French that they possess a prose. English has not this privilege.

It has the admirable quality of bestowing mercy on both sides.","Thought is more than a right - it is the very breath of man. Whoever fetters thought attacks man himself. To speak, to write, to publish, are things, so far as the right is concerned, absolutely identical. They are the ever-enlarging circles of intelligence in action; they are the sonorous waves of thought.","Try as you will, you cannot annihilate that eternal relic of the human heart, love.","A man is not idle because he is absorbed in thought.

The rule is without exception."],"Victor Koo":["Our management team strongly believes that the key opportunity of our business does not only come from just the increase in terms of number of users but also how we continue to enhance the value of our platform for our users.","Remember, when YouTube was founded in the U.S., America's Funniest Home Videos had been around for a long time. In China, the history of TV as well as user-generated video is very, very short. So, we've actually had to do a lot of things to motivate that.","'YouKu' means what's best and what's cool in Chinese. So, the whole product philosophy really revolves around how to help users, from a massive video database, finds what's best and what's cool.","It's very hard to just have a pure form like a Hulu or a YouTube to be successful in China because our view is, users come to a platform; they really don't care whether it is professional or whether it's a user-generated, or it's premium, you see. They want to come to a big database to be able to find the content they want.","Both YouKu and Tudou do original content for a number of years, and we position it based on our difference in terms of age demographic. And so the content itself is really more suitable for the brand itself.","If Youku had adopted YouTube's business model, we just would not be here. We would not exist.","The online video business started in both China and the US around 2005/6, when broadband penetration grew big enough.","In the U.S., search engines are king. That is because everyone already knows what they are looking for. Brands have been around for a long time.","In China, going public has a cachet from a branding standpoint. It will improve our image to ad agencies, government regulators.","Youku Tudou is a hybrid, like combining Netflix and YouTube. Like Netflix, with Youku, which launched in 2005, we syndicate a library of longform content and create original content. The Tudou model started with user-generated content but is increasingly becoming about partner-generated programming.","Our platform is a one-stop shop, from marketing and promotion through to ticketing. But even in the early days, in 2006-07, when we were mostly carrying shortform video, we became the premier movie marketing platform.","At the Hong Kong festival, we were co-producers of the opening film, 'Aberdeen,' which is the third part in a popular movie series.","Youku Tudou has helped transform how media and entertainment-related content is distributed and marketed since our inception.","While we can learn from U.S. models, we certainly can't practice them.","If I hadn't gone to Stanford, I'd be working at P&G now.","If you don't like what you do, you're probably dragging your feet.","If you do like what you do, you're cooperating and sharing.","Getting direct consumer revenue through movies or games or other culture products is something that we are very suitable for.","Back in 2005-2006 when Tudou and Youku were founded, we saw the inflection point with the opportunity to build the leading PC-based video website.","With the rapid growth of Internet users in China bringing online video into a new paradigm, the market scale we first envisioned as an online video website back in 2006 has grown significantly.","Since our inception, Youku Tudou as the leader in the multi-screen video space has helped transform how video and entertainment-related content is distributed and marketed.","Youku Tudou kicked off 2014 in a positive direction. Mobile has become the number one screen for Youku Tudou, and we are the undisputed leader in all of the important mobile video traffic metrics.","I do wish to emphasize that in light of the Alibaba deal, Youku Tudou management will remain independent, and we will continue to be open to opportunities for cooperation with other strategic partners going forward.","On top of opportunities in further traffic growth, there are increasing opportunities to fully realize the potential of the online video ecosystem, as China continues to evolve into a consumer-driven economy.","The combined entity Youku Tudou Inc. represents a dominant leader in online video sector in China with the largest user base, most comprehensive content library, most advanced bandwidth infrastructure, and most effective monetization capability.","The enhanced features of our ad products would require sufficient understanding from our sales force, advertisers, and agencies. To facilitate this, we have held multiple training sessions internally and road show events externally.","The advertising market in China is big and is still growing at a considerable pace. While online video is emerging as a mainstream advertising solution, it still represents a relatively small portion of advertising budget in China.","Broadening and deepening the relationship with our users and advertisers have always been our strategic priority.","On the monetization front, our strengthening leadership in internet user base and broadening reach of our platform have already positioned us as a must-buy platform in online video for brand advertisers to reach a nationwide audience within China.","With the scale of our traffic, content library and monetization ability, we are confident to see profitable growth in the future."],"Victor LaValle":["One of the reasons I love devils so much is not based in my faith, but because as a kid, I grew up loving heavy metal and horror movies, and the devil is such a huge presence in both.","If you want to learn the true nature of a child you have to watch how she plays. If you want to learn the true nature of an adult you have to watch how she does her job.","Clothes are a kind of uniform. A nun's habit, a surgeon's scrubs, a cop's uniform. People often say that when they put on a certain uniform, they actually think of themselves differently.","Miniature golf, like billiards, is a game of angles. And, like billiards, most of the fun is in pretending you know what the hell you're doing. The worse you do, the more you have to laugh.","What's beautiful about Godzilla is, of course, it's in every way a symbol of Japan dealing with the aftermath of the atomic bombs being dropped on them, and their ideas of how they're affected by it.","My three obsessions are mental illness, horror and religion.","I had a pretty bad time when I was an undergraduate at Cornell University. I failed out of school. I was much, much heavier.","One of the most widely read novels by a black American is Ralph Ellison's 'Invisible Man.' It is his masterwork - it won the National Book Award in 1953 and catapulted my man to the highest levels of literary esteem.","You can't write a story about a mental hospital in the United States without facing the grand example of 'Cuckoo's Nest.'","For as long as I could remember, the person in E23 pasted the same Halloween decoration, a witch with a giant wart on her crone's nose, but whenever kids rang, the tenant wouldn't answer. At first, kids figured they'd just missed the guy: bad timing. But it seemed impossible that all of us missed him every year.","On June 23, 1864, Ambrose Bierce was in command of a skirmish line of Union soldiers at Kennesaw Mountain in northern Georgia. He'd been a soldier for three years and, in that time, had been commended by his superiors for his efficiency and bravery during battle.","I have a very intimate knowledge of the world of the mentally ill and of life inside of, especially, public hospitals and the way people are treated in there and the way that they try to survive in there.","Fear warps our understanding of reality and even our ability to see reality clearly.","The devil that stayed with me most vividly was the one from the cover of Iron Maiden's 'Number of the Beast' album.","I've spent my life visiting a handful of people who are very close to me when they've been committed to one hospital or another in New York.","The best monsters are our anxieties given form. They make sense on the level of a dream - or a nightmare.","Bram Stoker's 'Dracula' was a story about the fear of immigration; the bad old bloodsucker swooping in from Eastern Europe and also preying upon 'our' vulnerable women.","I like America, where believers eddy around each other like currents of air. Even our atheists are devout! To be an American is to be a believer. I don't have much faith in institutions, but I still believe in people.","The profession is never going back to those days when a handful of wealthy people treated publishing like a hobby: one where the business can lose money because the family has lots of it to burn. Frankly, I don't think that model was ever sustainable, and it really only enriched a small number of writers.","I know that many authors say editors don't edit anymore, but that's not been true in my experience.","Try imagining James Joyce not writing about being a Catholic.","It's tough to write beautifully about ugly things, but Mitchell S. Jackson makes it look easy.","Since Queens is the most ethnically diverse plot of land on Earth, we had tenants from all over the globe. The whole world in one building.","I was dressed like Darth Vader. Vader was my man, even with the villainy. He wore all black and had a deep voice; he reminded me of my uncle. I had a cheap mask-cape combo, the kind available at any pharmacy during October.","Lumpy and lazy; I aspired to lethargy. In the second year of university, I missed half my classes just because I couldn't pull myself out of bed.","I weighed 25 stone, and I didn't stand nine feet tall, so the weight didn't sit well on me. As big as a house? No. I was as big as an estate.","Here's the thing: I was charming. Well read and well spoken. Observant and even kind. In other words, I was kind of a catch. And I knew this was true. As long as you couldn't see me. If you saw me, you'd think I was the sea cow that had swallowed your catch.","Lonely women destroy themselves; lonely men threaten the world.","Our family suffers from a hereditary condition called, generally, mental illness. Specifically, multiple family members in successive generations have suffered from either bipolar disorder or schizophrenia.","I realise I might pass down an incurable illness to my son, but living based on what might go wrong seems like less and less of a life as I get older. The one thing I can try to control is whether I teach my child to be ruled by anxiety, by fear. That's something that gets passed down, too.","I hadn't stopped fearing the chance of passing on an illness, but that fear had become balanced by the observation that being ill wasn't the same as being beaten.","One of the things that doesn't come up as much as it should, especially in literary fiction, is this idea of faith and God... I feel like those are things that should be wrestled with... because they are such an integral part of our community on every level.","People use the notion of God to bully people and hurt people, when we can use the concept to respect and uplift.","Education is gathering information and reading... No human being can thrive without some form of education. How you get it is up to you - the important thing is that you get it.","I spend lots of time on the Web, some of it even useful.","There are times when I need to dig up the diagram for a type of satellite dish, for instance, but I just can't seem to phrase this need correctly. As a result, I'm inundated by advertising for satellite television and people's online customer reviews of such services when, in fact, I was only trying to figure out what a certain component is called.","When I find the right information, the Web is a blessing; when I don't, it's a distraction.","There's the wonder of being able to do research from your own living room, of course. I do find that my biggest research issue, though, is how to frame my questions.","In the end, what's any good reader really hoping for? That spark. That spell. That journey.","I can't inhabit my characters until I know what kind of work they do. This requires research because my jobs for the last decade have been author and professor, and I'd like to spare the world more author or professor novels.","In the past, a writer had to go outside and get to know others before learning about their work, but the Internet has made humanity more accessible for misanthropes like me. I read blogs, tweets, Facebook posts and Reddit threads where people detail their jobs.","Social media give me the privilege of learning about more people than I could meet in my whole life. Taken together, the Internet reads like the grandest character-driven novel humanity has ever known. Not much plot, though.","The project of Ralph Ellison's 'Invisible Man' is exactly that: to assert the beautiful, bountiful, chaotic complexity of one black American male. And, by extension, all black American males.","I didn't grow up in a small New England town like the one in 'The Sundial.' I was raised in an apartment building in Queens, not in a sprawling, slightly sinister mansion like the one where the Halloran family resides.","'The Sundial' is written with the kind of humor that would make a guillotine laugh.","Shirley Jackson enjoyed notoriety and commercial success within her lifetime, and yet it still hardly seems like enough for a writer so singular. When I meet readers and other writers of my generation, I find that mentioning her is like uttering a holy name.","I'm always trying to make myself laugh. I'm the most enthusiastic audience I'm likely to find, so if it doesn't make me smile then it probably won't work on you. The jokes that only make me shrug get cut.","The horror genre is vast and full of brilliance. Stephen King, Shirley Jackson, Herman Melville, the book of Esther. I'll happily join that list.","'The Ballad of Black Tom' was written, in part, during the latest round of arguments about H. P. Lovecraft's legacy as both a great writer and a prejudiced man. I grew up worshipping the guy, so this issue felt quite personal to me.","I wanted to write a story set in the Lovecraftian universe that didn't gloss over the uglier implications of his worldview.","The people I am most interested in are the ones on the edge of losing everything and falling into the last bit of despair. I'm trying to write about how people exist on that edge and how they can come back.","Every era needs a genre through which it understands itself.","'The Devil's Dictionary' reads like a collection of great Twitter posts. And as people do with tweets, they can swipe Bierce's best lines and recite them as nearly their own. The reflected glory of reposting.","The journalistic endeavor - at least theoretically - is grounded in objectivity. The goal is to get you to understand what happened, when and to whom.","I'm a big fan of monsters. Number one, they're fun, and two, they're such great ways to access the subconscious fears and beliefs of any group of people.","In fiction, it's a big challenge to keep the reader in one place for so long.","As a 13-year-old fan of horror fiction, I hadn't seen too many cities in the literature I loved. It was always small towns, or backwoods locales, or maybe the suburbs.","Whether it was H. P. Lovecraft's doomed towns or Shirley Jackson's lonely, looming 'The Haunting of Hill House,' the boondocks had all the fun. As a black kid in Queens, New York, I couldn't have felt more removed.","'Dark Gods,' T. E. D. Klein's book of four novellas, felt like a godsend - even if it came from a deformed god, one that lurked beneath our sidewalks.","When I finished graduate school, I had a master's of fine arts from a prestigious institution, a manuscript that would eventually become my first published book - and almost no marketable skills.","I'd read at a much higher-than-average grade level since, well, grade school.","Booksellers are the bartenders of the reading world. People share thoughts and interests they keep private from others in their lives.","No one ever knows if a book is good until they read the book.","I couldn't get a date, but I couldn't be quite sure how unattractive I'd become. I was still friendly; I made jokes, and in my mind, if I saw a woman smiling at me... I still had a chance. I did not."],"Victor Mature":["Hollywood is a place where the stars twinkle until they wrinkle.","I'm no actor, and I've got 64 pictures to prove it.","I'm an emotional actor. When I'm doing a scene, I really believe it. I live the part as long as I'm in the scene.","Actually, I am a golfer. That is my real occupation. I never was an actor. Ask anybody, particularly the critics.","There's a lot to be said for loafing if you know how to do it gracefully.","I wasn't pampered the way a Tyrone Power was.","I took acting five times as seriously as anyone else. I just couldn't show it."],"Victor Mitchell":["The war on drugs has made government more powerful, citizens less free, and hasn't helped users or addicts.","My mother has a tremendous amount of pride and self-respect. She won't take assistance from anybody.","The voters of Colorado deserve honest, straight-talking elected officials.","I lived in New York until I was eleven years old, when my mother left my two older sisters and my father. My mother is 90 percent blind and deaf. She left and moved all the way to California. So I left my two older sisters and my father behind at the age of eleven and moved cross-country to take care of her.","I started working at age thirteen. I'm a product of public schools, I'm a product of a public university. I started my first company when I was 21. I've subsequently never worked for anybody else. I started that first business when I was still in college.","My wife and I have very deep roots in Colorado, and we can't see ourselves living anywhere else.","We've got to stop pandering and start leading.","I don't think that attorneys should be in any way running for governor.","I had a 100 percent voting record with the NRA, but I don't believe in bazookas in our schools.","We are very committed to putting forward a really bold message for the state of Colorado.","My son's a West Point cadet.","I would consider myself conservative but sensible and pragmatic.","There is no reason why any public school district in our state should be on a four-day school week. If anything, we should be extending the school year.","I want to stop piling people into prisons and stop branding people with a felony for a personal weakness."],"Victor Oladipo":["I feel like I have another level every year that I start a new season of basketball. If I continue to keep growing, and make everything consistent, I'm going to get better and better each year.","I'm just abnormal. I'm a weird dude.","Growing up, you always want to hang with your dad - go fishing or whatever. But my dad was always working, so we never really had time for that. I think I kind of learned to accept it."],"Victor Ortiz":["I appreciate everything that has been done for me. After a difficult start, I've just followed my dreams.","When you're growing up, it's always nice to have someone you can relate and look up to. I'm proud of how I conduct my business and how I have accomplished all that I have accomplished, and hope that I can be a positive influence on not only the Mexican community but also young boxers and people all around the world.","I am very proud of the fact that I get to go out there every day and train in order to represent the Mexican people, and I can only hope they look up to me in a similar fashion.","Later in life, when I'm retired and have a family of my own and will be able to send my kids to college, that's when I'll start spending. Way too many athletes go broke these days, and I like saving my money so that I can ensure my family and friends currently and after me will never have to endure some of the things I did when I was a kid.","I do not have a family, per se. When I was younger, I grew up in foster care with my brother and sister. It was really a struggle, and knowing that there were people out there with tight-knit families really made my childhood an unfortunate one.","I've always been seen as the underdog in everything I've ever done in my life, and it doesn't bother me in the slightest. The lessons have just made me stronger."],"Victor Papanek":["Design, if it is to be ecologically responsible and socially responsive, must be revolutionary and radical.","The only important thing about design is how it relates to people.","There are professions more harmful than industrial design, but only a few."],"Victor Pinchuk":["Art, freedom and creativity will change society faster than politics.","Politicians love power. I love freedom. That is why I am not a politician.","What is extraordinary about contemporary art is the energy - it has our energy. New energy. Pieces hundreds of years old are beautiful from an aesthetic point of view, but without our modern energy.","Today in Ukraine, many people struggle to survive, older ones often see the breakdown of the Soviet system as a loss of stability and security for average people, and therefore a certain hostility to quickly acquired wealth is from their point of view quite understandable at the first look.","Businessmen need to understand the challenges of society and contribute to solving them.","Contemporary art will help me to modernise our society.","Olafur Eliasson is also one of the most visionary artists I've ever met. He is from Denmark and Iceland, and his focus is nothing less than the entire universe.","In all the world, rich people are very unpopular.","Financial crisis is the moment of truth for real collectors and true artists.","I am a citizen of the world, and also a citizen of Ukraine.","I conduct business, not dependent of public sentiment, but according to the rules of fair business.","Ukrainian business must really embrace global competition. We need to understand that competition for resources and clients is not with competitors from across the street or from another city, but with millions of businesses around the world.","My pipe business I created from scratch; my media assets and bank I bought from the secondary market.","I don't want to privatise part of the parliament, like some people in Russia.","For me it's very important to turn Kiev into one of the main centers of contemporary art in the world.

Bureaucratic inefficiencies, abuses of power and the misappropriation of public funds must end.","Turkey is a model of economic and social development, especially in terms of human resources and regional cooperation.","Romania strongly supports Turkey's E.U. accession.","Ever since I took to the streets when I was 17 to protest at great personal risk against the communist dictatorship, I have been a passionate democrat.","I am a committed European; a united Europe is Romania's future.","My government has promised to comprehensively respect the independence of the judiciary.","You should see all the negative things that the Romanian press writes about me.","The image of Russian troops pouring into Ukraine and encircling military units in Crimea has been a wake-up call that will reverberate for a generation.","Only together do Europe and the U.S. stand a chance of keeping liberal democracy as the central doctrine for organizing world affairs.","Using cold facts and figures, leaders throughout the West must become more transparent with their citizens in explaining their decisions and their choices in global markets.","All sensible politicians favor growth, just as we all favor sound public finances. Both can be achieved if we rationalize spending, invest available resources wisely, and clamp down on tax evasion.","If history judges society for how it treats those in need, so markets judge economies by the incentives they provide for private investment, the infrastructure that supports growth, and the burdens placed on job creation.","Research suggests that large divisions of income and wealth weaken demand and generate economic imbalances that create instability and undermine growth.","There is no breach of European rules committed by companies from Romania or on Romanian territory.","With the backdrop of its geostrategic location and historical ties with the Middle East, Turkey has an essential role to play for the stability, peace and social development of the region.","I would like to thank my colleagues for voting a Social Democrat prime minister and to assure them I will vote a liberal president, as well.","Poland is much more advanced than Romania in structural reforms.","The best thing anyone can do in life is to give opportunities to a child.","All children should have equal opportunities.","I hope Greece is going to remain in the Euro zone.","China needs a powerful Europe, but Europe can only be strong if each and every one of its members attains rapid economic development.","I'm young enough not to be a rival to Mr. Basescu.","Romania is still very much underutilizing its natural and human potential.","In the end, I think the majority of Romanian society will understand that if we respect environmental protection standards, if we have benefits in taxes, royalties, jobs, we should do what all the modern countries in Europe and beyond are doing to take advantage of their natural resources.","How can I convert the enthusiasm of voters into a practical programme of action that meets their desire for economic security and greater prosperity?","I see four principles as laying the foundations for the kind of economic recovery Europe needs: fairness, efficiency, solidarity and growth.","Reducing debt through budgetary consolidation is essential to restoring Europe's financial health.","Fiscal discipline is a priority in Romania, and we have already proven we are committed and able to make real progress in this area."],"Victor Salva":["I have a controversial opinion about evil, because I don't believe evil exists. I believe that actions are dark and destructive but I don't believe evil is a thing. I believe it's a by-product of man's fear and desperation.","I don't have any illusion that The Creeper is as popular or will ever be as popular as any of the classic movie monsters, but I think in the heart of every young horror fan is his desire to create his own creature.","I think that's still the most primal fear of all humans: to be eaten.","I've never made any effort to hide what happened. I served my time, I've tried to learn and move on.","When I was about 13 or 14, I had an English teacher who made a deal with me that I could get out of doing all of the year's regular work if I would write a short story a week and on Friday read it to the class.","I think I'm very interested in people, in the way our minds work and how we navigate through the experience that is life. Very interested in people's struggles and their choices and their regrets and joys. I'm very interested in the human animal.","'Jaws' was the definitive filmmaking turning point for me. It came out in the summer of '75 and I saw it an obsessive 55 times. They even ran a very embarrassing article about me in the local paper, about the weird kid who's seen 'Jaws' 55 times."],"Victor Spinetti":["A lot of actors won't do things because they say it is boring when you are always working. A lot of them won't go on tour, a lot won't do pantomime. I think you should do everything.","When I started out in life I wanted to teach."],"Victor Vasarely":["Every form is a base for colour, every colour is the attribute of a form.","It is the original idea that is unique, not the object itself.","In basic research, intellectual rigor and sentimental freedom necessarily alternate.","I fight for the debunking of the artist and an end to individual pictures."],"Victor Webster":["I don't want to miss out on the chance of having a good time.","Everything we do, even the slightest thing we do, can have a ripple effect and repercussions that emanate. If you throw a pebble into the water on one side of the ocean, it can create a tidal wave on the other side.","If you're not challenged, you'll get bored.","Television is generally on the conservative side, so if you're seeing it represented on TV, that probably means it's really out there in the real world.","I was raised doing martial arts.","I think I'd just like to get in a time machine and travel and never come back. The '20s would be an incredible place to be, dressing up in tuxedos with fancy cars. That sounds incredible.","I believe sci-fi fans are incredibly intelligent.","I do a lot of mixed martial arts - it's like unlimited fighting. I do Brazilian jujutsu, beach volleyball. I don't like my routine to get stale, so I also lift kettle bells and push cars."],"Victoria Abril":["You can fake your age or mask it, but the passion that moves the characters has to be real.","Keep your ears open, your eyes open, grab everything you can, react, and learn!","Acting is the work of two people - it's only possible when you have the complicity, the help, even the manipulation of a director.","Compared to dancing, films seemed to me to be the work of lay bums. There was no physical pain; it was enough to say and imagine what was in the script. It was very easy for me.","For most of my career, I've played roles that were written for other actresses.","I chose the most explosive dress I could find. I put a ton of makeup on and some great round earrings. I looked like Jennifer Jones in Duel in the Sun.","I like men with some belly who are a little over the hill.","I really wanted to work and become independent.","I went to dance classes from 9 in the morning until 1, then to school from 3 to 10 at night, always under the threat that if I failed a single course I could forget about dancing.","I'd heard it was dangerous to walk around Miami.","I'm a small and normal girl, and stories like mine no one likes to tell. Fortunately so, because I wouldn't like to play myself.","My current companion, Gerard de Battista, is the father of my two sons.","My first vocation was dance.","My only friends were boys, and I was just one more of them.","On my fifth film, it was then that I stopped dancing.","People love coming on television, even if they have to show their miseries.","Psychiatrists don't solve anything from one day to the next.","The actress they'd hired had refused to appear naked in front of the camera. I didn't like to appear naked either, but the first thing I did was take off my clothes and jump into the pool completely naked.","The director had come to Madrid to court me.","The director took my face in his hands and asked me to show him my teeth, as with a horse. This happened on a Wednesday, and by the following Monday I was shooting.","The film kept me from working as a secretary. It was a real stroke of luck. A miracle.","There's nothing more human than two people making love.","When I said I was going to audition for a film, I got a hearty laugh from all my family.","When you have to get into the character each morning, give it your voice, your face, it was torture.","I didn't go to school a lot."],"Victoria Aveyard":["Action set pieces are my absolute favorite thing to write. I'm pretty much always in the mood to do them, but music certainly helps the process. I usually brainstorm out the dynamics and choreography of a fight to music beforehand - it gives me the little sparks of imagination when I get to the gaps in my own creativity.","I don't necessarily set out to teach or say anything in particular in my writing. Morals and themes come out as I'm telling the tale.","My biggest bits of advice are, write as much as you can, finish what you start, get a thick skin, don't take crap from anyone, but also live your life and have fun. The stereotype of a writer holed up alone all day is really unhelpful. You can't write real people and real emotion if you don't let yourself experience them.","Every inch of my writing career has been influenced by my screenwriting education. I was lucky enough to go to film school at USC, and I got a crash course in how to tell a story efficiently. I learned structure, pace, my style, how to know your audience, and most importantly, how to take criticism and edits properly.","All my favorite books and movies are franchises like 'Harry Potter' and 'Lord of the Rings,' so that was always the dream, that maybe I'll get to write a series of my own.","I have sort of weaned myself off of reading my own reviews, which is a constant struggle.","I write, having seen what's happening already in my head. I see it as a movie, and I'm just writing down what's happening in front of me.","My number one job at the end of the day is to entertain.","Telling stories has been a compulsion of mine since I could physically say, 'Once upon a time...' But in high school, I realized I could study creative writing in college and actually pursue it as a viable career.","My writing could be the most beautiful or important piece of prose, but it means nothing if it's boring, if people aren't listening or reading. I think transporting someone, putting them in a story for a few hours, taking them out of their worlds, is what I always strive to do.","I definitely look up to Veronica Roth, Suzanne Collins, and J.K. Rowling.","World-building is my favorite pastime, so with me, I'm always about reining myself in. I don't want to lose too much of the mystery by hammering every detail to death. I did fiddle with lots of maps for 'Glass Sword,' as the second installment sees Mare, Cal and company traveling throughout their country, and that's always fun for me.","My favorite part about Mare Barrow is her almost selfish survival instinct, as well as her increasingly gray morality. Her character arc in 'Glass Sword' is a lot deeper and more emotional than before, so I'm glad I got to write this sequel and that people want to read it.","Maven is very much a haunting presence in 'Glass Sword.' His influence is everywhere, and he dogs Mare and Cal like no other. He's my favorite character to write because he's so complex, but also because he affects everyone else so deeply. He's kind of like the source of gravity. Everyone moves around him and what he's done.","I'm a TV junkie, so it's hard to choose just one. Currently I'm a slave to 'Black Sails,' 'Vikings,' 'Game of Thrones' and 'The Mindy Project.'","I'm a child of the Disney Renaissance, so the new classics are near and dear. I suppose this is a legend more than a fairy tale, but 'Mulan' is easily my favorite. Not only is it a fun, action-packed, beautiful movie, but it's so important for young girls to have.","I wrote a lot of 'Red Queen' wrapped in a blanket, cramped up while watching the snow come down.","'Jurassic Park' and 'Star Wars' shoved me into loving sci-fi and film in general when I was a barely coherent 3-year-old. And 'Lord of the Rings' took me to another planet entirely. Before that series, I knew I loved writing, but after, I knew that I had to write.","I've been working through Maurice Druon's 'Accursed Kings' series. They come highly recommended from George R. R. Martin, and for good reason.","I force myself to outline, but not too closely, so I guess I plot by the seat of my pants? My natural instinct is to dive right in, but I know I'll get stuck. I like to stick with the architect vs. gardener metaphor. I guess I'm a gardener who plants tomatoes. I have the sticks in the ground and let the vines grow along those parameters.","'Glass Sword' has several set piece scenes that I plotted out or visualized before I wrote them, but I always knew they were coming. They anchor bits of the story.","I definitely have the screenwriting itch.","I'm really enamored with the idea of a reformed society, and I've always been fascinated with the Dark Ages as well as the power vacuum that followed the fall of the Roman Empire.","So far, the biggest regret I have in regards to the world of 'Red Queen' is that I didn't get to world-build enough. I don't think I did enough work explaining how the world came to be, and while I'm planning to go more into it, I'm a greedy writer, and I'm always going to wish I had more room to delve into the complexities of a fantasy realm.","I start out giving characters archetypes and parameters. Once I know the basics and have a rudimentary model, it's easier to carve unique curves and edges. It's quite easy to guess how a character is going to react if you know their background, and at a certain point, you realize you understand them personally.","I've always loved massive worlds, whether in fantasy or science fiction. I like the idea of making my own rules as well as utilizing everything that I love or inspires me. It's very freeing to know you can write a story that can be as big as your own imagination.","I'm a visual writer, so it's fitting that my first brush with 'Red Queen' was an image. I had the idea of a teenage girl in an arena, a bit like 'Gladiator,' and she's about to be executed. But instead of being killed, she kills her executioner with lightning.","I'm a sponge when it comes to stories. I'd say everything influences me in some way, but for 'Red Queen' in particular, I was really affected by the 'A Song of Ice and Fire' series by George R. R. Martin.","I like to let the story flesh itself out, and usually, the characters make their own decisions as things get under way. Dialogue especially seems to write itself once I'm familiar with the characters and their backgrounds.","I didn't have a desk to write 'Red Queen' on, so I got a nice writing desk."],"Victoria Azarenka":["My grandmother is the person who inspires me the most.","I was missing out on a lot of things that my friends were doing, but in another way, they were missing things I was doing. It was kind of a trade-off I had to make.","I always take things step by step and match by match.","I like to go shopping, to the movies, all the girl stuff. Just a normal girl.","I love the game and I am so lucky to be able to do what I love.","I'll never be like a Barbie girl, that's for sure.","I just want to have fun.","I don't really care how I sound.","You cannot be in pretend for people to like you.","I'm always honest.","I feel like when the task is more difficult for me it's more exciting.","I love New York. It's one of my favorite cities.","You know, I think I'm the worst player to talk to about statistics.","There are so many steps you have to go through to reach a high level, so you're kind of building your own, I would say, mountain. You have to go piece by piece by piece. When you're young and really ambitious, you want to jump right up. It kind of teaches you a lesson, I would say.","I'm not a big fan of watching my matches.","Things are never perfect, so I never get too high about things, or get too down about things anymore.","I have learned how to better handle things as they come."],"Victoria Beckham":["I love fashion, and I love changing my style, my hair, my makeup, and everything I've done in the past has made me what I am now. Not everyone is going to like what I do, but I look back at everything, and it makes me smile.","I think the sexiest thing about a woman is confidence, but confidence in a humble way, not in an arrogant way. Sense of humor is definitely important. And sunglasses always hide a multitude of sins. Sunglasses and a great pair of heels can turn most outfits around.","My glasses say a lot about me because I think me in a pair of sunglasses is an image that a lot of people would recognise.","There's nothing wrong with constructive criticism, and I learn from that and better myself. I'm not expecting anyone to be sycophantic in any way; I never expected that.","I want my kids to have a good work ethic. I believe you can achieve anything if you work hard enough to get it.","I like to make the best of what I have. I'm not a supermodel, clearly. I'm not a makeup artist. I'm a real woman.","I want a big house with a moat and dragons and a fort to keep people out.","I find that even the simplest of dresses, if it has the correct seaming and the correct fabric, whatever shape or size you are, it can change the way you hold yourself.","I believe you can achieve anything if you work hard enough to get it.","If you haven't got it. Fake it! Too short? Wear big high heels, but do practice walking!","I have always loved fashion since I was a kid and customized my school uniforms.","Strong women, that's who I really respect.","The first dress that I wore in the Spice Girls, which everybody thought was a little black Gucci dress, was actually from Miss Selfridge - it wasn't a little black Gucci dress.","I've only ever tried to be me.","I was never going to give Mariah Carey any competition.","It's great when women support women. We need more women out there supporting women.","We are like a traveling circus, our family! We sing, we dance, we do football, we do fashion.","When I dress in a certain way and do my hair and makeup in a certain way, it's not to get attention.","We are still so close, David and I. We were at a party the other day at my mum's house and I was sitting on his lap. We're very affectionate. And I looked at him and thought after being married for 11 years! We were the only couple who were even near each other at that party. We're soul mates.","It's not healthy to be jealous.","I want to evolve each season. I never want to be one of those brands where people know what they're going to see. I always want an element of surprise. One thing I never want to do is copy what anybody else is doing. I have a signature, and it's very important to me to stay true to that.","I have no time for women who don't support other women. It's the ultimate compliment when a woman tells you that you look good.","I'm not a supermodel. I make the best of what I've got.","I'm a very, very healthy eater. I eat lots of fish, lots of vegetables, lots of fruit. I don't eat junk food.","When you're in a position to be paparazzi-ed just walking down the street, you'd look a little daft if you were smiling all the time.","Sometimes I really wish that I could sit back and enjoy it, live in the moment more. But I am terrified, and I want to better myself, not that I want to prove anything to anyone other than myself. I am ambitious, and there are many things I want to do. It doesn't get any easier.","I'm lucky that I do something I love, and I am proud, as I think it's a positive message to give to young women: if you want to have a career and be married with children, then you can. It's full-on, but it's doable.","I actually used to smile a lot in pictures. I think I only stopped smiling when I got into fashion. Fashion stole my smile!","I've got great people who handle my schedule, and everything does revolve around the children. If there's a parents' night or an Easter bonnet parade or a Nativity play, whatever it might be, then I plan everything around that.","I like a man who can be a real friend, has a good sense of humor, a good pair of shoes and a healthy gold card.","I was never a natural. I got there in the end because I did believe that if you work hard enough, then you can achieve a lot.","I wake up every morning and I feel like I'm juggling glass balls. I live in Los Angeles, my business is run out of London, and most evenings I'm cuddled up in front of Skype, in my dressing gown, speaking with my studio in London. I travel a lot, my team travel a lot, but I wouldn't have it any other way.","I'm very realistic. I know my boundaries - I know what I'm good at and what I'm not good at.","I've been to parties in L.A. that are mind-blowing. I mean, quite literally mind-blowing. People get cellphones in the party bag, that sort of thing. Fabulous, fabulous parties.","The glass is always half full: I have no time for anything negative - and actually, I've bought crystals for all my team, so they all carry crystals as well.","I'm always in flats. Jeans, jumper, flat shoes or a pair of trainers. It would probably surprise people, but I have to be comfortable. It's not about me dressing up and looking good. I've got to get stuff done.","I have always been a great believer that women should support women, and my admiration goes out to mothers everywhere, as they constantly put their own needs behind those of their children, embracing daily uncertainties and entering the new uncharted territories that each day brings, to be, in return, rewarded with joy and unending love.","I don't like laziness or cutting corners.","The Euro-bureaucrats are destroying every bit of national identity and individuality.","I don't know much about football. I know what a goal is, which is surely the main thing about football.","I'm not materialistic. I believe in presents from the heart, like a drawing that a child does.","What's David's role? David looks good, that's what David does. David looks good, and I'm the funny one, that's what I hear constantly. But I keep telling him that looks fade.","The older you get, the more comfortable you become with yourself, and you accept what you have physically.","I tell you, the paparazzi would not be sitting outside if they realized I was the most boring person in Hollywood.","I'm a very driven, ambitious, positive person. But I'm a spiritual person as well.","For me to go to America - which I find such a positive place - well, I took to it like a duck to water.","My children and my husband make me smile. My work makes me smile.","I'm living in Beverly Hills. I'm very, very lucky. I wake up every morning and I recognize that I'm blessed.","I like to think of my customer and make sure that season after season she is getting what she wants. Ultimately, I suppose I have an image of myself. That is the person I am designing for - a woman who loves and appreciates fashion and luxury, and somebody who wants to feel empowered with the best version of themselves.","When people ask if I have any advice for young designers, the best advice I could ever give to somebody is to work for someone else, when you are playing with someone else's money. It is very expensive when you start doing it on your own.","I don't have to work; I need to work.","I've never been a six-foot-tall, skinny model, so therefore, I want to create an illusion. People always think I'm taller than I am - not just because of the shoes I wear but because of the way I dress. It's all relatively streamlined.","The kind of person who's going to stand on the red carpet and love the attention and have the big grin - I'm just not like that. I want to get in there, do what I've got to do, and get home to my kids.","Fashion will take on added stature one day, but try not to be stifled by it. You will learn, as you mature, to swap heels for Stan Smith trainers, minidresses for crisp white shirts. And you will never be one of those people who just roll out of bed.","I keep fit by running after my three boys all day.","These people are amazing. It's so emotional I was thinking about wearing waterproof mascara.","People are mean on social media, whoever you are. It's a shame people have to be that way.","I'm still me even after all that's happened.","I love Brazilians. Brazilians ought to be made compulsory at 15.","This person they make me out to be irritates the hell out of me as well.","You have to remember that when you are a performer you become a celebrity, but you are not saving lives. It's not that important.","I've been that celebrity on the red carpet, and I appreciate that something hasn't got to just look good from the front, from the back, it's got to look good at all angles.","I'm very proud to be British, and my brand is British.","I am a control freak. I am very hands on and pay attention to details.","My dresses are for women of all different shapes and sizes. Actually, the one I tried on yesterday was the one Jennifer wore. And who'd have thought I'd be the same size as Jennifer Lopez!","There are rumors that we want to move back to the U.K., but we're so happy in America I actually can't see us ever leaving... People ask me how long it took to adapt. Twenty minutes.","In England, David and I are big fish in a small pond. But in L.A., we are tiny, tiny, tiny fish in a big pond.","I can relax in L.A. I think I'm the only person in that town who doesn't want to act. I was an OK singer. I was an OK dancer. But acting? Never could do it.","People I respect complimenting me on my work in fashion is more exciting to me than anything I ever achieved as a Spice Girl.","I'll admit it: I'm a control freak. I am. If I'm going to do something, I'm going to do it 110% or there's no point in doing it at all, especially if the work takes me away from time with my husband and children.","I become quite obsessive when I get into something.","People always think I'm taller than I am - not just because of the shoes I wear but because of the way I dress. It's all relatively streamlined.","My aim is to create the perfect dress!","I very, very rarely get the opportunity to go shopping and actually feel the clothes and try things on. I love shopping, but I do it mostly through Net-a-Porter.","My children are my priority and always have been.","I think as I have got older, I have got a bit more relaxed, although you might not think that if you heard me screaming at my kids.","I don't believe anyone who says they don't care what people say about them. Of course they bloody well do.","When I started out in fashion, everything had to be very structured and tight and controlling, and now I'm getting to a point where I think - I could wear a great big parka, that could be quite fabulous. I haven't always got to show off my size, show off my shape. It's a turning point for me."],"Victoria Billings":["Constant togetherness is fine - but only for Siamese twins.","The best thing that could happen to motherhood already has. Fewer women are going into it.","There is no such thing as being too independent."],"Victoria Clark":["The thing about being an actor is that as we get older, there are more and more characters to explore and, in general, they get more complicated, so you get to bring all your crazy life experience to the table.","My deceased grandmother on my mom's side was a real fairy godmother, who lived to be 102 and who I always feel is looking after me.","Whatever life lesson I'm going through at any point in my life, projects just somehow magically appear that help me work through it.","Matthew Broderick and Megan Mullally were unbelievable to work with in 'How to Succeed.'","Here's the deal with Matty Morrison: He is the most unassuming, nicest, most humble guy, who also happens to be extremely talented.","I'm a lyric soprano. I can try to step outside that and do different kind of singing, but it's not something I can sustain over the long haul, and what is good for your voice is good for your career.","I have been blessed with roles that allow me to express something very personal at a specific time in my life. I seek them out; acting is my therapy.","In addition to being the most beautiful score I have ever sung, 'Piazza' gave me the opportunity to honor the matriarchs of my Southern family."],"Victoria Gotti":["God hears a mother's prayer.","Prosecutors say my father was the biggest crime boss in the nation... If you really want to know what John Gotti was like, you need to talk to my family. We lived this life.","The public saw my father right out of central casting. He looked the part, acted the part... he was the part! The real life Godfather.","I think I realized early on that my family wasn't like other families.","I would lay awake nights and cry a lot thinking, is my dad gonna come home? Is he gonna go to jail again? Is he going to get killed?","My existence was never a Francis Ford Coppola existence.","You feel it in there, pacing your heart sometimes, and it has what's called a defibrillator. Should I suffer that arhythmia, it's generally sudden death. And the paddles that are internal shock you back and restore your rhythm to its normal and natural state.","Well, I'm a writer by nature, and I got a little bit - a little taste of a daily fast-paced writing job, writing career, and I loved it.","I do get most of the harder-to-get stories."],"Victoria Hamilton":["I made a decision that I wanted to do five years of classical theatre before I did anything else, which was a very unfashionable thing to do.","Looking at the actors I most admire - Judi Dench, Ian Holm, that whole generation - they all started in rep and slowly built themselves into the position where they could juggle theatre and film.","I know I'll always want to come back to theatre, and I also thought if I can crack classical acting, everything else will probably seem easier.","When I left drama school, saying you were going to the RSC made you a laughing stock.","Like any relationship, a marriage does take work.","I don't want to just be another actor in L.A. looking for a job.","I think I have a period drama face. That's the reason I've always gone back to the West End, because for me, that's where all the interesting roles have been.","Film would have been great, but I don't think I was ever in the frame.","I think I was quite difficult to cast when I was in my twenties because I never looked like Cameron Diaz. I'm not talking myself down, but I was never going to be the romantic lead in a Hollywood blockbuster. You need better cheekbones and longer legs.","The great thing about getting older and doing TV and theatre is that the roles get more interesting, and you're not cast because, 'Oh, she's always looked extraordinary.'"],"Victoria Hanley":["The main characters for 'The Seer and the Sword' made an appearance one night and then haunted me for over five years before I began to write them down. Does that count as inspiration? For me, characters tend to show up, stay on to help with the work of writing their stories, and then occasionally deign to visit after a book is finished.","As a child, I amused myself by making up stories. I'd lie in bed when I was supposed to be sleeping and imagine other lands where people were doing fascinating things. By fifth grade, I knew I wanted to be a writer, but it took several more decades to really find my way as an author.","I grew up in a household without a TV. We lived next door to a library for a while, and at one point, I checked out all the books in the fairy tale section. I remember the librarian's quiet smile as I'd bring back one stack and exchange it for another.","'Seize the Story' takes readers all the way through the process of writing fiction, from beginning to end. Every element, from dialogue to setting, plotting to character creation, is laid out and illustrated with examples. But the tone of the book is not that of a dry writing manual - it's definitely written for teenagers."],"Victoria Jackson":["Because I hate fake people and I always think I'm never fake.","There was a lot of Southern Baptist preachers and some yelling ones but mostly we had a pastor who didn't scream and I found a lot of comfort and joy and peace as a child hearing the Bible.","I cried when I heard Johnny Carson died.","Sometimes I like to vent.","I remember going to church about four times a week. I liked it a lot.","Religion is man's attempt to bind himself back to a relationship with God.","I stayed a virgin until I was 23. I didn't do drugs or drink or smoke.","I got a gymnastics scholarship to college, fell in love with my true love of my whole life - who I'm married to now - and he was a virgin too. It was very romantic.","When you go on an audition it's very frightening.","But if you believe in Christ and that your main goal with your life is supposed to be to honor Him and do His will, then you don't have as much pressure as someone who bases all their happiness on whether they're a movie star.","I was the only Christian on the cast, but that was cool because we all respected each others talent and mostly they respected me a lot even though I was the only Christian.","Now, I don't mind making fun of those preachers who steal money from people, they kind of deserve it.","I thought it was a really good contrast to have a really sweet, sincere, church girl sitting next to the church lady who seemed kind of, you know, over the top.","Maybe entertainment is not supposed to be reality.","Are Christians too stupid that we can't write a script, we can't film a movie OR we don't know how to act?","Maybe I'll learn how, but the only thing I can do is turn down parts that would hurt my conscience.","I always dreamed of being Maria in The Sound of Music.","That's pretty much why I went into show business because I wanted to have a guitar and sing unaccompanied, that was like my fantasy of the perfect life.","I think the reason they cast me as the good girls is because they couldn't find any in Hollywood.","I've had a lot of struggles and I would be in a lot of trouble, I think, if I wasn't a Christian.","I think abortion is murder.","They're desperately searching for meaning in their lives but they will not crack the Bible open.","It doesn't make your life stop being fun to be a Christian.","Maybe if I could ever be a successful comedian then I could be an example that Christians can also have fun.","The bottom line of Hollywood is money.","I've never been in the music industry, only acting.","It was the best job I ever had. I just left because my whole team was leaving and the new guys were coming.","So finally I came up with a thing that felt really pure, and I'm Christian, so when I hear about death I have a lot of hope because I believe in Jesus and life after death, and John 3:16.","I always wanted to be on a sitcom.","I wasn't really qualified to be on Saturday Night Live - I'm not like an impressionist or anything."],"Victoria Justice":["It's nice to just embrace the natural beauty within you.","Being a teen can be tough. Just try to surround yourself with really good friends that really have your back, and also be a really good friend to those who really care about you. If you're not sure about certain things, talk to your friends that you trust and your family.","I love fashion and there is no easier way to express yourself than through the clothes you wear.","I don't have to wear any other makeup as long as I have blush.","Focus on something that you have a passion for and hone that skill; it will make you feel confident about your ability.","So many girls only care about guys and looking good all the time.","I think prom is just about enjoying yourself.","I would describe my personal style as eclectic.","Everyone wants me to be perfect, but I am so far from perfect!","You know when you have a good relationship with someone when you are just perfectly happy to be quiet and just hang out and do nothing.","Going to a concert is so overwhelming and the energy is amazing.","If you've been driving for a little while and nothing's happened to you yet - and you've been texting and driving - you think, 'Oh nothing's going to happen.' But all it takes is an accident happening with one of your friends or God forbid, something happening to you, to really give you a wake-up call.","New York, in itself, has this frenzied, chaotic feeling to it. It's such a big city, and it's always moving, and there are so many people.","You have to be really careful with what you put out on social media and who you're talking to online.","Educate yourself: Read up on current events and books.","Sometimes I feel edgy, sometimes I feel like I want to wear a bright, bold beautiful color.","I'm all about the supplements. I take fish oil every single day, as well as vitamin D, magnesium, B complex, vitamin C.","Well, I'm an independent person.","My mom is not trying to live vicariously through me.","What really matters is what's on the inside.","In a lot of ways, I wasn't a normal teenager.","I definitely think there could be stricter teen driving laws.","I do love getting dressed up, but sometimes it's glam and edgy mixed together.","When I go to a concert, I can't help but feel happy and everything else just goes away. I hope everyone feels that way at my concerts.","To even be called the 'teen queen' is crazy.","If you're going through friendship issues, I would say, first of all take a step back. How important is the friendship to you? Sometimes, if someone's not being a good friend to you and isn't treating you the way you should be treated, then you kind of have to move on sometimes.","I'm half Puerto Rican and every Friday we have rice and beans and chicken in my house - so that's like a very Latin staple. It's just so comforting. I look forward to every single Friday because I just can't wait for my rice and beans and chicken.","I could work 24 hours and I wouldn't complain once because I'm happiest when I'm working.","Someone once told me that something they really liked about me was that they thought that I was really down to earth and not high-maintenance. I think that was cool. It's important to stay grounded.","A guy wants a classy girl who is smart and has goals - someone that he wouldn't be afraid to bring home to his parents.","I'm a jeans fanatic. It's ridiculous how many jeans I have.","My day-to-day look is inspired by comfort, color and just how I'm feeling that day.","I like to dress for my body type and for my coloring.","Guys don't like girls that throw themselves at them. That's something that I've learned.","My number one thing was that if I ever did get successful enough to make it, I wanted to be able to give back to my family.","At a young age, I had to give up a lot of things, like being able to hang out with my friends.","I don't want to be the type of person to have my relationships plastered in magazines.","I listen to all kinds of music, honestly.","Both music and acting are huge parts of my life - it's all about balance.","I was almost 8 years old when I was watching a kid on a TV commercial, and I told my mom that I wanted to do the same thing. She said that I would need to get an agent and that she would research it.","As far back as I can remember though, I always loved performing.","I love my fans, and I try to keep in touch with them as much as I can.","I've never been a partier.","People always ask me, 'Is there a rivalry between the Nickelodeon and Disney stars? Do you guys hate each other?' Like everyone has to be on one team. If you're a Selena Gomez fan, you can't be a Victoria Justice fan. We're both half-Latin, and people put us in the same category.","I would love to work with Cameron Crowe; he's definitely one of my favorite directors.","I've written a few songs that have to do with being in a relationship, the bad and the good.","If you're smart and you care about life, you'll take driving seriously.","If you don't feel like you're ready to get your license - just because people are putting pressure on you, don't feel like you have to rush into something. Take your time, really feel confident and be ready. It doesn't matter what other people say, do what's best for you and makes you feel safe.","I love 'Homeland.' I think it's such a well-done, well-acted TV show.","When I was younger and first started watching MTV I loved watching TRL. I loved watching my favorite singers/bands perform.","My first concert was 'Nsync.","I love making movies and hope to write my own screenplay someday and do some producing and be behind-the-scenes as well.","I think there's a perception out there that people know me based on these glamorous photos they see of me in magazines, but I have about two hours of hair and makeup and then people to dress me, to make me look even better, in those pictures.","Guys who are charismatic and fun-loving and sweet and generous are the ones I want to date.","I like people who can and like to make fun of themselves!","I've always taken direction pretty well.","I want to play a variety of different characters in different genres of film.","I'd say that if you had a strained relationship with your mom, for whatever reason, the best thing to do is be open with each other, talk it over, try and work it out somehow as opposed to just putting a wall up and pushing them away.","I will say that a lot of songs that I've written are from my own personal experiences which are special to me.","When I was little I had this notion of being a marine biologist. I grew up by the ocean so I was always in the water but realistically, I don't think I would make the best marine biologist.","I think talent makes me really attracted to someone more than anything.","My favorite TV show is probably 'Glee.' I'm a Gleek, like everyone else!","I don't really consider myself to be famous.","I can't hold a grudge anyway.","I'm not looking to shock anyone.","Someone's career that I admire would have to be Justin Timberlake's because he started off on Disney and he made this huge film career and huge solo music career. I really respect him as an artist.","I want to write music that's going to appeal to everyone.","I want to work with producers who are unique and have a different sound.","I want to stretch myself as an actor.","I am undeniably afraid of the dark!","I don't take myself too seriously.","I don't want to sing boring pop songs - I want to sing songs that are meaningful to me.","I look up to Mick Jagger because he's an amazing performer and he's such an individual. I respect him and admire him eternally.","You have to be able to unleash your inner goofball with me.","I guess because people are more aware of who I am, they're going to wonder about my personal life.","I think it's really cool how J. Lo's been able to balance an acting career and a music career. That's something I strive for.","I like being active and riding a bike around my neighborhood and exercising when I can.","I love going to second-hand stores.","If you love something, you have to stay really focused and can't let outside things distract you.","Just because something is on trend, it might not work for you.","Music is such a part of my soul.","I'm skilled in the Twitter and Instagram sense of the social media verse.","I live for comedy. I've been doing it for such a long time. Comedy is hard in itself.","I love to read books by women I look up to who are smart, funny, and interesting, like Tina Fey's 'Bossypants' and Mindy Kaling's 'Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?'","I love comedy; I'm very goofy and spontaneous.","I admire people like Kristen Wiig, who is hilarious but also does a lot of really cool films. I would love to have a career like hers.","I drink lots of water, and I've been trying to do daily wheatgrass shots, but they're awful, and I have to plug my nose.","I'm a huge sushi fan. I have it every couple of days.","My stepdad is a Patriots fan, so I've become a Pats fan, too.","When you know what you're passionate about and what you want to do, just go for it and own it.","I feel so honored to be reprising the role of Janet Weiss and stepping into Susan Sarandon's shoes."],"Victoria Legrand":["As you get older you realise that nothing lasts forever. It's not depressing, but it does make moments more intense.","My hair is a wild, untamable beast! I like letting it grow; my bangs grow whatever way they want and I kind of follow their rule. So side bangs, poof bangs - it's kind of unpredictable.","For me, it's really day to day. I don't really plan ahead and I like to be excited about what I'm wearing. Being on the road all the time, it's various articles of clothing that keep me inspired and feeling good. A fun or beautiful thing to wear can change your day. I think spontaneity and not adhering to any narrow styles keep me happy.","I think the voice is an underrated instrument these days and it's easy to make up for lack of ability with effects. I think sometimes people are more wowed with effects than core craftsmanship. Strong voices are not as common as they used to be.","Obviously, it's great to know that your music is being listened to.","With us, people caught on to something on our third album, and that will never be repeated. Basically, I don't really have any complaints about the way that Beach House has grown. I feel like we're still in control of what we're doing, and it's a great time in our existence.","Sometimes people talk about music, whether blogs or magazines, in a strange way where it doesn't seem like they're actually listening to it.","It's always about trying to make everything go with the music, like a script. It's not like, 'Let's have a confetti gun!' If I ever have one of those, it will be because it's absolutely the right thing at the moment in the song. I can't just go get a confetti gun.","I don't wear dresses and flowers in my hair and float around!","We feel more and more intensely about the music we make. It's unexpected, and not always what you would think of in Beach House. It's all art in the end. We aren't making records because we have to; it's because it's what we want to express.","As long as artists can make something, artists will continue to survive.","I don't like to read the Internet; I'm not aware of what's going on.","Yeah, it's a lot harder to find a musical partner than a love partner.","I wouldn't mind doing a soundtrack someday.","I personally do not listen to a lot of music. It helps keep my mind free. I don't want to sound like someone else from the get-go. I want to express myself and the world in my head.","I don't think my vocals demand effects. I like reverb to a certain extent, but I don't want to hide my voice. I like stripped-down vocals, but I also like crazy, powerful, doubled vocals like in dance or electronic music.","But I love the hot sweat. I think overheating onstage is invigorating. It's better than being comfortable. I think being comfortable is the death of a show.","I like to find the beauty in the ugly. When I'm in a thrift store, I gravitate toward pieces I know I'll wear a ton, and insane pieces that I'm sure most people would consider gross. But I find them inspiring. Our van is currently stocked with some of my random findings from this tour. Maybe I'll call my aesthetic 'van fashion.'"],"Victoria Moran":["The idea that everything is purposeful really changes the way you live. To think that everything that you do has a ripple effect, that every word that you speak, every action that you make affects other people and the planet.","There are some things that money can't buy: peace of mind, for starters, and lean muscle mass. Neither the Queen of England nor the founder of Microsoft can put in an order for either one.","Our culture has long mistrusted the body. It's been seen as a confusing blend of God's handiwork and the devil's playground. It is, rather, a vortex of intelligence.","I'm a big believer in living life as an extended working vacation.","Taking B12 is the price of getting to be vegan, the way wearing a helmet is the price of getting to ride a motorcycle and giving up alcohol for nine months is the price of getting to have a baby.","Beauty at 70 years old isn't the same as beauty at 20 years old, but it is stunning nonetheless.","By itself, tofu is like wet foam rubber, but you'd no more eat it by itself and expect fine dining than you would stare at a blank canvas and expect to see fine art.","Your body has something in the neighborhood of 40 trillion cells - quite a consulting committee. Call on it when you're confused or undecided. Relax quietly and ask your body what it has to say.","When it comes to literal nourishment, the food we eat, life begets life.","My calling, as one imperfect human, is to celebrate and uphold life every time I get the chance.","Being vegan is not the key to immortality. We're all going to get sick and die. But to know you're living without harming? That's the loveliest feeling.","The idea that somebody else is going to swoop down and play the fairy godmother role is pretty unlikely, so why not take care of yourself?","Because love encompasses everything, nothing is unimportant, including tonight's dinner menu. Think about it for a minute. If you were pure love, the loving parent of all life, how would you want people to eat?","I see people having fits because their coffee is too hot or their baked potato is too cold, or some random something is imperfect and somebody can be blamed for it. These people can fly off the handle and nobody says, 'Too much beef will do that to a person.' If it's a vegan: a clear case of alfalfa sprout poisoning.","Enjoy your food, enjoy your life.","Moderation is actually the flip side of dieting, that is, imposed deprivation.","I'm not perfect, but what's wonderful about eating a plant-based diet is, I don't have to be.","'Make your plate look like a Christmas tree,' I tell people, 'mostly green with splashes of other bright colors.'","Every year when I put away my winter clothes and get out my summer clothes, they fit. And I haven't been on a diet since the Reagan administration.","As I see it, a green salad is an open invitation to carrots, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, and the sprouts that grow in jars on my kitchen counter.","Evolution happens in nature and in individuals. I want to participate actively in its happening within me.","I have to strive to go two steps forward and realize that, sometimes, there will be one step back.","What I have to work with is the life that's ahead of me right this minute.","I need a spiritual connection - I can make changes, but I can't make miracles - and I need people around me who'll support me and believe in me and tell me the truth and not let me deceive myself into avoiding the what's scary and hard and necessary.","I'm over the hill, maybe even the whole mountain range, but I don't see it that way even one little bit.","I was a fat kid who didn't discover the joys of active play at the time of life when we're supposed to be imprinted with a love of movement. That means that I'd rather be called for jury duty than go to the gym, but I go anyway.","I could be a vegan in sackcloth and flip-flops, but I find fabulous boots with periwinkle cuffs a far preferable option.","On the issue of abortion, I'm ever on the fence, or, at most, an inch or two to either side.","I don't eat animals. I rescue strays and take injured pigeons to the wildlife rehab. I carry spiders and wasps outside in a cup covered with a 3x5 card. It would only follow that I'd take pause when contemplating the abrupt and apparently brutal ending of a tiny human being's life, or even a potential human being's life.","My most firmly held value is what Albert Schweitzer termed 'reverence for life.' I take this seriously; many would say that because I extend it to nonhumans, I take it too far.","In the past, I used to argue with those who didn't share my views. I felt this incredible need to 'make my point.' Now I live my life and do my best to be an example of what seems right to me.","I realize that I'm a mature woman and one of these days, incredible diet or not, I'll be a little old lady.","I suppose I am one: an activist - for animals and a vegan lifestyle. I hear that word, however, and look around to see if someone is indeed referring to me.","I don't have the activist temperament. I like listening to divergent points of view and hearing people out. I like getting along. I even like being liked, although activists of any stripe should get rid of that handicap at the outset.","I know that as a vegan, I'm in a minority. People love their meat. It's up there with sugar and TV and maybe even coffee on the list of inalienable American rights.","I am an urban vegan. I love the glossy pages of 'Vogue,' even though I won't purchase the leather shoes and bags I see there, and being reminded that the fur trade even exists breaks my heart.","It simply feels right to me to blend the glittery delights of New York City with a largely raw vegan diet - with the soul-deep conviction that animals are not ours to eat, wear, exploit or experiment on.","You're supposed to be using your gifts and fulfilling your dreams, at every age.","Being vegan is a glorious adventure. It touches every aspect of my life - my relationships, how I relate to the world.","Life would be very dreary if there were no magic. If the real world were only that veil of tears, I just don't think could get up in the morning.","The idea that somebody is going to come in and make your debt go away and all be well for the future is really a fantasy.","Recreational shopping is the shortest distance between two points: you and broke.","You want to live a life in which the things you have traded your hard-earned money for are quality items that really do uplift your life.","Vegetarian is like raising a kid Mennonite. It's difficult but not that different. Raising your kid vegan is like being Amish. A totally different world.","We all live with blinders on. They come with having a personal vantage point."],"Victoria Osteen":["Let me encourage you to get up every day and focus on what you do have in life. Be thankful for the blessings of the little things, even when you don't get what you expect.","As you keep your mind and heart focused in the right direction, approaching each day with faith and gratitude, I believe you will be empowered to live life to the fullest and enjoy the abundant life He has promised you!","We talk a lot about hope, helping, and teamwork. Our whole message is that we are more powerful together.","Our relationships are precious, valuable treasures from heaven, and we should handle them carefully, always looking for ways to build bridges to each other's hearts.","Choose to be kind. Choose to forgive. Let your love grow and shine so that people may look at the example of your life and glorify God in Heaven.","It's amazing what you'll discover if you start exploring what God has placed within you.","Even in the tough times, He's still a good God.","Bitterness and unforgiveness block the flow of God's blessing in your life and actually hinder your prayers.","Do good 'cause God wants you to be happy. When you come to church, when you worship Him, you're not doing it for God, really. You're doing it for yourself because that's what makes God happy.","Choosing forgiveness opens the door of your heart and makes way for a miracle in your life.","God has given us all wonderful unique gifts and talents to use to glorify and celebrate Him.","Remember, the choices we make today shape the people we become tomorrow.","Sometimes God presents opportunities that look insignificant or rather ordinary. Perhaps you don't see how they fit into the big picture for your life. But if God is asking you to do something, He has a purpose for it.","You hold the keys of change within you. You be the change you want to see.","Our life ripples out, and it has influence. That's why it's important that we're at our best and that we're influencing others for the good.","I think that we have a great opportunity to impart our wisdom and our knowledge and our experience to this younger generation. It may be different times, but experience transcends time, and wisdom transcends time.","Let me encourage you, if someone has wronged you, and you still get that cringing feeling on the inside when you see or think about that person, take it to God and allow Him to keep your heart soft and sensitive.","I think when you have an optimistic attitude, and you believe that God is guiding you, that you will find the good things in your life and that you will lead to good relationships and good people in your life. And you can make the most of what he's given you.","With His love, you can wake up every day with an attitude of faith and expectancy.","We should celebrate Christmas throughout the year, but I believe the whole concept of giving was the basis of Christmas, that it was a charitable, you know, giving, and I think we got carried away with giving.","If you're not careful, you can fall into a destructive cycle of self-pity.","You are God's own masterpiece! That means you are not ordinary or average; you are a one-of-a-kind original.","When you receive God's love and encouragement, it will empower you to do more than you ever thought possible.","I've learned in my life that things change. Seasons changes, times change. We take different jobs. Our children grow. So, we have to study the people in our lives and adapt to them, because when we do that, we get more out of our relationships.","I just think that is so important to keep a strong support system, to keep yourself encouraged.","Don't look for approval in what everyone else is doing; look for approval from Almighty God.","At the end of day, what matters most to God, what moves His heart, isn't our fancy words and impressive possessions - it's the condition of our hearts.","I bake a chocolate cake from scratch every week.","You need to love your life; you have to appreciate yourself.","Reality TV is to popular because it allows so many people to sit on the sidelines and just watch somebody else's life. God is saying, 'Don't sit on the sidelines of life. I have put so much in you, but you have got to be strong and very courageous. You have got to step out in faith.'","We only have a certain amount of energy for each day. If we use it for the wrong purpose, if we focus on the negative or dwell on whoever hurt us, then we're not going to have the energy we need for the right purposes.","One thing is certain: our families are important. Don't get so stressed out and so preoccupied that we neglect one of the greatest things that God has given us, and that's our families.","In our family health, it's about having a balanced life, about laughing and staying on a positive note.","Well, I - you know, the scripture says that God works by faith. And you have to have faith. You have to have trust in God so that God can work.","A lot of times we see choices in front of us, and we limit ourselves by what we see. God wants us to see His way of doing things. And His way is always greater than our ways.","You may not be like everyone else, but that's okay. Be who God made you to be.","Everybody can make a choice to be more positive. It's about who you hang around and what you choose to watch on TV. What environment you put yourself in. It's easy to get a negative internal dialogue. You have to be aware of what's playing in your mind.","Books are such a great way to spend time with your children, open lines of communication with your children, and just build that strong foundation.","God's Word is alive and powerful! When you declare these words over your life, the truth of God's Word draws forth the seeds of love that God deposits into us when we invite Jesus to be our Lord and Savior.","Imagine Him smiling down on you right now. Embrace His love. Remember, you are His most prized possession, the apple of His eye!","It's important to recognize that forgiveness is more than mere words; it's a heart attitude that induces a spiritual transformation.","At one time or another, we have all faced the temptation to disconnect by giving someone the silent treatment. After being married to Joel for more than twenty-one years, I have learned that is not the best way to handle a disagreement.","You have to make time and tend to things that are important in your life so you can live the life of blessing God has promised you!","When God created you, He went to great lengths to make you exactly the way He wanted you to be. You are His ultimate work of art.","I try to listen to my children. I try to change with my children.","As women, we're nurturers by nature. We want to make sure everyone is happy. That's a good thing, but we also have to put ourselves on that happiness list.","There are a lot of times that we feel like our hands are tied - 'I have no control over if I'm going to lose my job.' 'I have no control over if I'm going to be able to pay my bills.' You've got to realize that that's where your trust comes in. You have to trust God, and keep your hope, because your hope is what produces your faith.","I believe that God wants us to show respect.","I think money helps us. It helps us. It's our - it's our exchange system. But it does not buy you happiness. It doesn't buy you health.","I have fabulous children.","I spend my money like I don't have anything.","I'd love my children no matter what.","Well, you can't argue with somebody that won't argue back.","I don't question God.","In fact, we have a choice of freedom of heart to follow God.","When you use your faith, it gives you energy. It gives you the ability to be able to see beyond where you are right now and see into the future.","I know when I get down and discouraged, it's hard for me to be able to just see anything except for right where I am.","You know what, my faith is like this - when I die, I'm going to live with God forever and ever. But I believe He wants us to have a good life here on Earth.","Well, you know, I just - I believe marriage should between a man and a woman.","When we obey God, we're not doing it for God... we're doing it for ourself. Because God takes pleasure when we're happy.","A lot of things we're supposed to do are hard to do, but we can do them. They're always beneficial. Really, some things that are hard are beneficial.","God's not complicated - He's really not. And He helps people in their everyday life so that they can get better in relationships, in their job situations, in getting through grief.","We try to keep a good line of communication open with our children. It's not always about trying to just teach them every moment, but it's about listening to them and trying to understand them and gain that sense of communication so when they need to talk to someone, they know that we're there.","The challenges are gonna go, and your children are gonna grow, so try to enjoy this moment, and try to look at what's good, and be grateful for what you have because you will see better days.","Children are our future, and God loves the children.","We want to encourage people. We want to help them. We want them to see all the good things God has placed in them and give them a right future.","I think that when you don't look at the good things around you, that you lose sight of all those good things. And you're not going to enjoy your life.","When we tend to the areas of life that are important to us, when we make those things a priority, that's when we will flourish in those areas.","If you just can't seem to get ahead, you might need to check your priorities. If you've had difficulties setting your priorities, ask God to help you.","We know what we are supposed to do and we don't want to do it, so we do the exact opposite anyway. And, it never goes well for us when we do that.","The thing is, God has already seen every twist and turn of your life. He already knows what's in your heart. He already knows the decisions you've made. He's just waiting for you to call on Him and be honest with Him like Jonah was.","We eat pretty healthy foods, and I've taught my kids since they were little about knocking out trans fats.","In some families, parents don't read or don't have the money to spend on books.","If you're not a parent, if you're an aunt or uncle or neighbor, books are an amazing gift.","Relationships are people's No. 1 priorities. They want to have good relationships, and a lot of times they don't.","I think we could all do better sometimes of not overextending ourselves as much.","I read to my children, and now they love to read. I encourage parents to carve out just 20 minutes a day. It helps you learn more about them, and really opens the door for you to speak into their life!","It is my desire to break the destructive generational cycle of illiteracy in the home by focusing on the children. Reading to your child has so much value as a parent because it opens the lines of communication.","I just look at all the fruit and all the people's lives that are being changed and are being touched. And that's what we really focus on because we hear - every day we get mail, we visit with people, and their lives are being changed.","The truth is we just have a normal life, because we do have a church where our children are growing up pastor's children. And we just try to keep it really normal.","It's hard to argue with someone that won't argue with you.","I believe God put that desire inside of all of us so that we can evaluate ourselves in the light of His Word in order to become all that He created us to be.","If we focus on loving others the way God does, scripture says that we will be fulfilling His whole law.","Life doesn't always give us what we are expecting.","When things don't go our way, we get to choose how we will respond. We get to choose our perspective. Will you focus on what you didn't get, or what you did get?","You may have made some mistakes, but just like a parent helps their child when they are learning to walk, God will help you get right back up anytime you fall.","Children touch all of our lives. We all have the opportunity to sow seeds into the next generation, and there's nothing more important that we can leave on this earth than a legacy of faith, hope, and confidence in our God.","God's not thinking about your mistakes, failures or shortcomings. No, His thoughts toward you are good.","Know today that God approves of you. He's pleased with you. He may not always be pleased with your choices or some of the things you do, but when God looks at you, He sees His amazing creation.","You matter to God, and every detail of your life matters to Him.","God values you simply because He created you. You are precious to Him, and your value will never change.","It's no secret that in our society, and many before, people are trend followers. For some reason, they feel better about themselves if they are dressed in the latest fashion or have the newest tech gadget.","I love David's attitude in the Bible. He wasn't afraid to go against the trends. He wasn't going to be defined by the opinions of others.","We have to be careful not to look for confidence in the acceptance of others because true confidence only comes from knowing God.","I want to remind you today that the greatest Artist of all time created you. He dreamed about you long before you were born, before a single brushstroke of your life took place.","As much as you may want to, you can't control what other people say or do; you can only control yourself.","If you focus on the actions of others and allow them to constantly upset you, then you are handing your peace over to them and giving away your power.","Remember, if you want to love your life and live it to the fullest, don't let the sun go down on your anger. If you don't have a solution to the issue, agree to disagree and focus on the importance of the relationship.","I am unable to give my best if I don't have my best to give.","We have to take care of ourselves if we are going to take care of anyone else properly.","We are God's creation, and we have a responsibility to keep ourselves at our best.","Don't fall into the trap of putting yourself last on the list or not even putting yourself on the list. That's not balance; it's not even healthy.","God doesn't want us to merely sit around dreaming about things we can do and be. That's a good place to start, but a poor place to stop. God wants us to turn our dreams into action.","When we step out in faith and use the talents He's given us, we show that we trust God, that we believe He will bless our actions and cause us to succeed.","If you will be the best that you can be right where you are, God will promote you and give you more.","Just because you have a disagreement with your friends or family members does not mean there are not plenty of other areas on which you see eye to eye. It just means you have a difference of opinion.","There will be times when we do not agree on every decision or subject, but we should always believe in one another, support one another, and move forward through life together - connected.","Oftentimes, people stay where they are in life simply because of fear. But do you know that fear isn't reality? It's only a thought in your mind.","One of the most important things you can do in your life is to learn to pull back the curtain of fear so you can see it for what it really is - the enemy blowing a lot of smoke and pushing your buttons.","You have seeds of greatness in you! I believe our lives as Christians should be the most exciting because we have the favor and blessings of God on our side!"],"Victoria Pendleton":["I'm definitely capable of just enjoying riding my bike these days.","I naturally favour a clean, healthy diet. A salad sandwich is one of my favourite meals!","Food plays a large part in our weekend, but on a Friday evening, I'll make us something simple for tea. I might have a wee glass of wine.","People will put restrictions on your ability, on your aptitude, on your talent, on your character, and to be honest, it's just opinion. Don't let anyone put you in a box or draw your path for you.","The sprint is sometimes like a toss of a coin. Sometimes it's heads, and sometimes it's tails.","Oh, I am an angel, though sometimes I wish I was more of a devil.","I genuinely enjoy the process of making colourful, delicious food. But I do allow myself an occasional piece of chocolate - today I had a pastry. If I fancy something, I'll have it.","I just want to prove that I am really good at something. And I haven't quite done that yet - at least not to myself. I know I could ride so much better, with more ease, with more finesse. I feel I'm nowhere near as good as I should be.","The sponsorship offers have been amazing. I have to turn down a lot.","People may think I'm crazy, but one of the ways I like to wind down my Friday is to get some of our household chores done, whether it's cleaning or doing a big food shop, so the house is all nice for the weekend.","I think I might become a pescatarian. I love sushi, couldn't give it up.","I never really felt I had the same respect as my male team-mates. My opinion wasn't worth as much. I used to sit quietly in meetings and not say anything, as I knew my opinions would be disregarded. And that's after I had become Olympic champion and multiple world champion.","I am a self-critical perfectionist.","In tennis, you can have a bad set and still win. The part of track cycling that is difficult to find in other sports is that it's so final; there's no second chance if you make a mistake.","I love sport and will do just about anything. Someone said they'd had a go at skiing off a mountain with a parachute, and that sounds great!","You look at a horse, and he's such a majestic, beautiful, powerful creature that you can't not be impressed. I love scraping the water off them when I wash them down because you go all round the contours, and its muscle and body, and you just think, 'Ooh, isn't this a magnificent creature.' You're touching it, and it's just solid, carved muscle.","I go round and round in circles, really, really fast, on a big wooden bowl.","I was put on a pony as a kid at some birthday party when you're all led around.","Oddly enough you'd think, now that I wasn't training professionally, I'd be able to enjoy a lie-in at the weekend, but I actually slept more when I was competing because I was so tired.","I used to have a rant all the time when things went wrong, at everybody around me, because you just have to get the frustration out.","Being a track sprinter, when it's all about a thousandth of a second, there is no escaping the numbers every single day.","Anyone that has been lucky enough to go to the races and witness the magnificent spectacle of a competitive race will know how people like me can instantly fall in love with the power and beauty of race horses in full gallop.","You have to be realistic. I'd love to be more famous, have lots of people supporting me, people knowing my name, but I need a tennis racket or a golf club or to play football. Being a female, I don't stand a chance.","Cycling as a whole is totally underestimated.","I think just drinking juice is too extreme for a diet. Your body needs more than juice, so I think it's a very hard thing to do - very challenging and probably very unhealthy for your body. You can't get everything you need from a juice. I love juice because it can provide you with nutrients - but drink it alongside your diet!","I worried I was a boyish shape. I always thought I might grow some, but it never happened.","I've seen pictures of me, and I look mean and arrogant. That's how I felt on the inside. I think now, 'Is that really me?'","I normally don't listen to my instincts because I'm so full of doubt.","It's a very unique feeling - to be that strong and unbreakable. But I'm working towards it.","I'm someone who wears their heart on their sleeve.","I find it hard to act other than the way I feel.","I was just, like, all I want to do is be really good at something. Really, really good at something, so people are vaguely impressed by me.","I'm not the perfect model of what an athlete should be, mentally or physically.","I've always been very open with my emotions. Actually, that's got me into a lot of trouble, too, in the past.","I was constantly being told I shouldn't talk so much about how I was feeling. They seemed to think I was giving too much away to my competitors. Showing signs of weakness. But I've always thought that was rubbish.","I've never pretended that I'm not female and vulnerable. To me, it's just being honest.","One of the first coaches I worked with on the national team told me that I was too skinny, too puny, and had no natural acceleration. He said I'd be better off looking for another facet of sport to follow. That was a really, really bad moment. For a long time, I felt as if my dad was the only one who had faith in me.","We are all totally committed as elite athletes. To think that pushing people around and bullying them is the best way to get results out of them is just ludicrous.","Don't get me wrong: there are some fantastic people who work at British Cycling who kept me together, who were there when I was struggling with it all. They were walking the same tightrope in many ways, because if you do speak up, your days are numbered.","I turn left for a living.","I like heels and make-up.","As a kid growing up - I can see now - it didn't matter what I did, as long as it was something I could be really good at. Cycling just happened to be the opportunity that came along.","As you ride in a steeplechase, and you're on the horse, going quite fast, you think, 'That's quite a big fence...' But trust the horse, and don't give him any reason to doubt you.","We've all said, 'No, no, I couldn't do that... ' But actually, you could if you just went, 'You know what? I will... and I shall.' Once you realise that, it's quite wonderful.","We don't talk about courage much in our everyday conversations, but I am comfortable with it now.","What the event will be like, being part of the Olympics and being in London, is too much to think about. You've no control over those things, so in a way, it's wasted energy to think of them.","I've always been like this - insecure - because I'm striving for something that can't be attained. I don't just want to be OK at this: I want to be the best at it, and I've never achieved that in my mind.","Even though I've won numerous titles and an Olympic gold medal, there are still so many faults in my performance that I can honestly hardly bear to watch the videos back.","People say, 'Wow, you've achieved it all this year: two world championship wins and an Olympic gold medal.' And I think, 'Yeah, but how come I feel so unsatisfied and under pressure all over again?'","I beat myself up the whole time because I'm striving for something I'll basically never achieve. I portray this image of confidence, of arrogance, and it's not really me. I'm never satisfied, and I'm never content. It means I'm a bit of a mess some of the time.","I always feel that most people out there who aren't sure if the gym is really for them aren't prepared to pay and find out.","I've been taught by some of the best strength and conditioning coaches in the country, and I've learnt that technique for weight training and cycling is very much more strength and less conditioning.","I love it and really, really enjoy weight training. I love free weights. I find it really rewarding.","If you start lifting weights, you will expect to put weight on, as muscle is heavier than fat. But you have to look more at your body shape - you will get heavier - but you might get smaller and heavier at the same time, which is fine. And it doesn't really matter what you weigh as long as you are happy with your shape and size!","I come from a cycling background. I happened to be good at it; the opportunities came my way. It wasn't something I necessarily searched to be involved in; it wasn't a dream. I just had an opportunity which you couldn't refuse.","I've always been very fond of animals.","I could scrape water off horses all day long. That would never get boring.","To be honest, after you've crossed the line at the Olympic Games, it is bedlam for the next, about, five or six hours. Media, press conference, dope control - you might get some food if you're lucky. You might see family if you're lucky.","Although, you know it's been really nice to wear the Olympic kit, I'm looking forward to wearing non-sports, feminine clothes.","My best hair care tip would be, choose a range that is right for your hair structure. Working with Pantene has made me realize the importance of this, and it really does make a difference. I have quite thick hair, so I use the Smooth & Sleek range.","I think women are by nature competitive - secretly, privately within their own selves, on lots of different levels, on the way they look, perform.","A car is a killing machine. It's like waving a loaded gun. People don't realise how dangerous they are.","Eating vegetarian in the past would have been a really bad choice as an athlete. Impossible. Just being able to get the amount of protein in was a mission. You couldn't be picky. I feel quite liberated by the fact that I can now quite recklessly choose vegetarian food.","There have been a lot of moments in my career when things haven't gone to plan.","I've lost a lot more races than I've ever won... it's all part of the journey, really.","You have to make the mistakes and have those failures in order to learn from them and grow and improve... But for me, the best way to combat any of that beating yourself up or overanalysing, the most important part is always to be prepared to the best of your ability.","As a teenager, I wanted to look like the early '90s curvy supermodels. Even in my early 20s, I always said as soon as I retired from cycling, I'd get a boob job.","As you get older, you get more accepting - although, if you asked me whose body I would want, I would say Jess Ennis's at the Olympics.","I used to feel very lonely on the team. The boys would all pair up.","The men couldn't understand how I could be so successful and so insecure at the same time - because it doesn't really exist in the same way in the male psyche.","Maybe guys also have insecurities, but in a sporting arena, they keep it to themselves. I can't do that.","I'm not one for going out on the town on Friday night, as I've never been a big drinker, so I like getting the rubbish jobs out of the way so we can enjoy our free time.","I often felt that I didn't train and race enough team sprint to get it right. You need to know that you've got a place to have that continuity of results. Am I in? Am I out of this one? That's tough.","It's an evolution. The same team doesn't always dominate, and it goes in cycles.","Winning is no longer just the outcome. It's part of the process.","I am so in tune with my body that I know how it should feel.","I am fighting my natural body shape to do what I do.","My success has got so great, it's like I'm trapped, almost, within it."],"Victoria Pratt":["We don't move on in the stunt unless it looks like a hit. So when I see it on TV, I'm generally satisfied that people are going to buy it.","I came to acting in a very circuitous way.","It's part of the job to compensate for outfit.","Cast changes are a hard thing. For two years, we had this little family. We weren't together when these changes were decided upon. It all happened during our hiatus.","I never was really into comics as a child, and I think if you miss the boat when you're a kid, you don't necessarily pick up on it when you're an adult.","When you're fighting with a stunt person, your intent is to miss.","There are a lot of great actresses out there. You learn to appreciate each one for what they offer.","Acting isn't the be-all end-all. There are a lot of other things in my life that will bring me joy if I didn't act anymore.","When I was in university, my dream was to be a coach, like a high school track coach. Not to teach.","I've been working some really long hours for the last five or six years. Anybody who works on series television knows, and especially women because women spend probably two hours more than the guys with all their hair and makeup crap.","I think I've paid my dues. I've really put in a lot of time on set.","I can't say that I've made the transition to movies.","I've been really fortunate to go from series to series to series.","People get on a show and they fought tooth and nail. Almost 95% of the actors out there want to be on a television series. Then as soon as they get onto one, no, no, I want to be a movie star. This television series stuff, no, no no.","I would be very happy doing movies. I love to work and I think I'm a little different.","I think I'm a people person. I get very attached to people. And I've become so attached to all the people on my show, the cast, the crew and the producers.","I desperately want a dog, but I've been told I travel too much, and I'm not allowed to have a dog.","I did a lot of stunts, so the harness work isn't foreign to me either.","In terms of being a role model, I didn't start out to be one. I don't go to work every day with that in mind. But, I do get a lot of fan mail from young girls.","There are a lot of other things in this world that can and will bring me joy. Acting is one of them.","My first paying job, when I was 15, I was a day camp counselor.","Linda Hamilton is my hero. She was so tough and so strong and so vulnerable at the same time. I think that's what woman action figures are allowed to be: vulnerable, in a way that women are.","In the beginning, people think vulnerability will make you weak, but it does the opposite. It shows you're strong enough to care.","You show your vulnerability through relationships, and those feelings are your soft spot. You need to have a soft spot.","It's all about exploring the more unpredictable aspects in the character, not just fighting people.","I approach my character with the question: What would an animal think? How would an animal respond? A lot of times, it's quick action and no fear, and sometimes it's irrational fear. You don't always know.","That's the thing with sci-fi and action roles. You have to play the danger as real. If you don't, you end up with egg on your face. You have to commit. You can't think about how stupid it might look without the special effects.","Women can't be afraid to look like action heroes. It's not always pretty, but when it's on the screen, it translates well to the audience.","Most women don't play like guys do: they don't wrestle, fight, get into brawls. They don't know how to express themselves in a physical, active way.","I competed in track for 10 years and have been doing kickboxing forever.","The most important thing is to just be good at what you do. You do a good job playing the character, and people will be taken up with your character, not your clothes.","We take the show very seriously, but we don't take ourselves seriously.","I read every script from beginning to end, and I read every draft that I can. I like the show, I like the character, and I want to protect both of those things.","It doesn't help anybody to put out a bad script.","If you watch the show and the characters don't look at each other while they're talking, the actors probably aren't getting along."],"Victoria Principal":["Don't strive to be perfect. Strive for excellence.","I got even with all the bad management I had by being a good manager.","Success doesn't mean that you are healthy, success doesn't mean that you're happy, success doesn't mean that you're rested. Success really doesn't mean that you look good, or feel good, or are good.","I believe that how you feel is very important to how you look - that healthy equals beautiful.","It is so easy to forget that this is good that we're alive. We should be enjoying this gift of being alive.","As long as my body is in shape, my mind is working at its full capacity.","I was very lucky. My parents raised me in such a way that it never occurred to me that I wasn't equal.","If wanted to play a sport, I played a sport. If I wanted to do things that many girls born in 1950 didn't do, I did it.","I grew up thinking that whatever I wanted to do, I could do.","Ignorance is not bliss, but in my case, that was.","I became so consumed with trying to live up to what the public expected that I lost myself. I don't know of anyone else who can say this.","I went to find myself and save myself by being an agent.","I went to a woman for advice about how to be in business, but I learned a great deal from men.","When I started Victoria Principal Products, there were 22 full-time employees - they were all women.","I'm about to become a member of the Chemists Society of America. I'm very proud of that.","It used to be you wanted to marry up.","When women work together, it's a bond unlike any other.","Oprah is so bright, and her intelligence is so piercing that I don't think anyone who spends a few minutes with her isn't struck by that.","You can't be responsible for the way people respond to you. You're only responsible for yourself.","I try to treat people the way I would like to be treated, but I can't worry about what everyone's going to think.","There came a moment in my life when I realized that I had stepped into another part of my life. I used to walk into a room full of people and think, do they like me? And one day I walk in and I thought, do I like them?","No one can make me work harder than I do, so I'm generally not interested in who I am competing with.","I'm generally competing with the ideal I have set for myself, and I've found that served me very well.","When I don't plumb the depths or the opportunities of each day, I don't have joy.","There are two things in life that I really wanted to do: be an actress, and to be in skin care, and I've gotten to do both of them.","As the years go by, I've added a few pounds on, and I like it. I like it that I look a little softer.","When I became a mature woman, I put both feet firmly on the side of maturity.","I enjoy speaking to other women about turning 50, and how we can enjoy it, and how we can explore it.","Unless we keep this planet healthy, everything else is for naught.","Victory Over Violence is an organization that was created to help fund shelters for women and children.","I arrived in California with no job, no car, and no money, but, like millions of other girls, a dream.","Being an agent gave me a great sense of satisfaction."],"Victoria Secunda":["Of all the haunting moments of motherhood, few rank with hearing your own words come out of your daughter's mouth.","Most fathers don't see the war within the daughter, her struggles with conflicting images of the idealized and flawed father, her temptation both to retreat to Daddy's lap and protection and to push out of his embrace to that of beau and the world beyond home."],"Victoria Smurfit":["If you're Irish, it doesn't matter where you go - you'll find family.","The idea of Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Dracula, all I could think of was, why haven't they done this with him before? It's such a genius idea. 'Dracula' has always been done as film, so it's been an hour and 40 minutes. What we're done is 10 hours of 'Dracula,' so you have a lot of freedom with all the different mythologies and nuances.","As an actress, the joy of being able to play the three sides of any woman, which are the glamour, the pragmatic and the one not to be messed with, is pretty glorious.","I think 'Trial & Retribution' as a brand can go on forever. Its joy is that it has, to an extent, a formula, which gives a comfort routine for viewers. But we allow our directors total autarchy in putting their personalities on their stories."],"Victoria Strauss":["Maybe self-publishing is going to be an extra step added to publishing. Maybe what's going to happen is you self-publish a book, someone notices it - an agent? - and it goes from there into the traditional sphere.","Print-on-demand and electronic self-publishing options have made it easy for anyone to set up a business as a publisher whether they know what they're doing or not.","Every famous writer was once an unknown writer. If publishers never published new writers, they wouldn't be publishing anyone at all after a while.","If you're going to self - publish, you need to know why you're doing it, what you want to accomplish, and how you plan to implement that.","There's a difference between publicity and marketing. A lot of writers don't realize how much marketing goes on beyond the scenes, with sales reps and advanced reading copies, all that stuff that happens months before a book is published.","There is an enormous shadow industry of scammers and amateurs who prey on aspiring writers, who divert people from the real publishing industry into this shadow world of vanity publishing and fee-charging agents.","It can be hard to say if someone has a deliberate intent to defraud or if they are just really, really bad at their business. But even if people are unpublishable, it doesn't mean they should be ripped off.","When I was submitting my first novel, I had no idea that publishing scams existed. I never encountered any, but I could have - and knowing how easily I might have been taken advantage of makes me determined to protect others from falling into that trap.","'Pay it forward' has become a hackneyed concept, but I truly believe in it, and it gives me huge satisfaction to be able to help writers in a measurable way.","Is it ever worthwhile to buy a review? Not in my opinion. With independent paid review services, quality can be a problem; plus, there are plenty of non-professional book review venues out there that will review for free.","Very wonderful books might be published, and very terrible books might be published."],"Victoria Toensing":["Any perjury case is a tough case. You just don't go on 'he said-she said.' You have to find corroborating evidence.","I go to the airport and I've had everything taken away from me because of the terrorists. People haven't realized yet, though, that we are at war."],"Victoria Wood":["In my day we didn't have sex education, we just picked up what we could off the television.","I know I've got a degree. Why does that mean I have to spend my life with intellectuals? I've got a lifesaving certificate but I don't spend my evenings diving for a rubber brick with my pyjamas on.","I have stayed true to that first idea that people can have a day in their lives that is very important and if they can reconnect with that day, reconnect with the people they were then, they can suddenly revive their emotions.","In London it's easy not to be the focus of attention, especially when Sting lives in the house just behind you.","All my friends started getting boyfriends, but I didn't want a boyfriend, I wanted a thirteen-colour biro.","Life's not fair, is it? Some of us drink champagne in the fast lane, and some of us eat our sandwiches by the loose chippings on the A597.","I once went to one of those parties where everyone throws their car keys into the middle of the room. I don't know who got my moped, but I drove that Peugeot for years.","I haven't got a waist. I've just got a sort of place, a bit like an unmarked level crossing.","Radio killed variety and TV killed radio, and the internet will kill television and it will go on and on.","My mother, she didn't believe in praise. She'd never say anything was great. I think that's quite Northern, to not make people feel too good. I didn't mind if she was proud of me or not, it didn't bother me. I was never trying to please her.","Music is an element that should be part and parcel of every child's life via the education system.","I sometimes think that being widowed is God's way of telling you to come off the Pill.","Sexual harassment at work... is it a problem for the self-employed?","People always think I hate doing interviews. I don't. I wouldn't do them if I didn't like them.","Acting is not my favourite thing. I don't like wearing costumes and wigs.","If you behave normally, people treat you normally. It's only when you act as if you're someone special that they feel obliged to stand on ceremony.","Music enriches people's lives in the same way paintings and literature do. Everybody deserves that.","A lot of panel programmes rely on men topping each other, or sparring with each other, which is not generally a very female thing.","I like writing a lot more than I used to. I used to find it scary but now I've got used to it once it gets going. I used to find it hard to start. Fear of the blank page. The first thing you write down won't bear any relation to what's in your head and that's always disappointing.","I used to make my own food and ate on my own in my room.","Well, I think there's not much of a chance for me finding somebody of my age. Gentlemen of my age are dropping down 30 years to find girlfriends.","In my 20s I was going round seeing agents who were patronising because I was fat and a girl, which was a double whammy. I knew what it was to feel out-of-the-loop."],"Victoria Woodhull":["Suffrage is a common right of citizenship. Women have the right of suffrage. Logically it cannot be escaped.","Why is a woman to be treated differently? Woman suffrage will succeed, despite this miserable guerilla opposition.","If Congress refuse to listen to and grant what women ask, there is but one course left then to pursue. What is there left for women to do but to become the mothers of the future government?","Rude contact with facts chased my visions and dreams quickly away, and in their stead I beheld the horrors, the corruption, the evils and hypocrisy of society, and as I stood among them, a young wife, a great wail of agony went out from my soul.","The women of the country have the power in their own hands, in spite of the law and the government being altogether of the male order.","I am a free lover. I have an inalienable, constitutional and natural right to love whom I may, to love as long or short a period as I can; to change that love every day if I please.","I now announce myself as candidate for the Presidency. I anticipate criticism; but however unfavorable I trust that my sincerity will not be called into question.","It makes no difference who or what you are, old or young, black or white, pagan, Jew, or Christian, I want to love you all and be loved by you all, and I mean to have your love.","Woman, no less than man, can qualify herself for the more onerous occupations of life.","While others prayed for the good time coming, I worked for it.","I shall not change my course because those who assume to be better than I desire it.","I ask the rights to pursue happiness by having a voice in that government to which I am accountable.","When I found I had given birth to a human wreckage, to a child that was an imbecile, my heart was broken.","My opinions and principles are subjects of just criticism. I put myself before the public voluntarily.","My judges preach against free love openly, practice it secretly.","I come before you to declare that my sex are entitled to the inalienable right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.","Denounce me for advocating freedom if you can, and I will bear your curse with a better resignation.","By what right do you refuse to accept the vote of a citizen of the United States?","Is it fair to treat a woman worse than a man, and then revile her because she is a woman?","If women would today would rise en masse and demand their emancipation, the men would be compelled to grant it.","Women have no government.","To go behind a man's hall-door is mean, cowardly, unfair opposition.","Let women issue a declaration of independence sexually, and absolutely refuse to cohabit with men until they are acknowledged as equals in everything, and the victory would be won in a single week.","I would like above any other place to go to Hartford. I want to face the conservatism there centered and compel it into decency.","I endeavor to make the most of everything.","I do not shake hands from a sanitary standpoint.","I and others of my sex find ourselves controlled by a form of government in the inauguration of which we had no voice.","For a woman to consider a financial question was shuddered over as a profanity."],"Victoria de los Angeles":["Well I look for an accompanist that does his work well, this to begin.","But it's always really difficult to find someone that has the qualities to be a great accompanist.","This quality, I mean Geoffrey was with me, was very easy doing - he loved me very much, I loved him very much, and we understood each other so well that it was a pleasure to make music.","To search for a pianist, it is very difficult; sometimes you find one.","With Geoffrey, it was the first time we did music together, we understood that everything could be well, and without any problem. And we didn't need to rehearse too much.","In reality I have said very little things; I didn't point out many things to Geoffrey, I trusted very much not only his understanding of what I was doing, or what I wanted to do, in that moment.","Of course the death of Geoffrey has caused a lot of trauma to me generally.","And finally I begin to have such a success in my examinations that I found myself in a career you see.","After that I won a prize, I was with a group of ancient music of Spain that they helped me a lot with a grant, you see, during three years. And so I made my debut in 1944 and I found myself helping my family, it was a very poor family.","But I have never wanted to be a singer, because the exterior part of a career, I don't like very much.","I like what it is to sing, or to be with the others singing, to make music, but the fuss and all the things that are the exterior part of a career, has never interested me.","So don't think in reality I am a singer, I think I am a human being that has sung always all her life, and has learned a little to sing, and has found herself in the middle of a career.","But I think it is more difficult to do a career as a lieder singer, and there have been less lieder singers.","Not unless I do all these ancient and Italian or French or Baroque in the beginnning, I do German.","I must say to you that my intensions for instance doing German, it is because Victoria de los Angeles is nothing to do with wanting to be like a German singer.","I don't like traditions, I am very personal, very independent, I don't like intimate ladies, I mean in German lieder there's a lot of copy, a lot of imitation, a lot of tradition, and this I have put it aside.","And after I compose my programs, but it is very easy because I look to the music in a very natural way without fuss, and so I look always music, in my home, like books and books and books, choose books and you read the pages, so I do this with music, and I make programs.","Yes, it must be something that goes very well with my voice, let's say something that I understand that this would be good communication with the others, and I don't pretend for instance, to look for music that would be something that doesn't go with my personality."],"Vida Blue":["I keep telling myself, don't get cocky. Give your services to the press and the media, be nice to the kids, throw a baseball into the stands once in a while.","I think I have already signed some scrap of paper for every man, woman, and child in the United States. What do they do with all those scraps of paper with my signature on it?","Sometimes in this game it's as good to be lucky as it is to be good.","It's a weird scene. You win a few baseball games and all of a sudden you're surrounded by reporters and TV men with cameras asking you about Vietnam and race relations.","Charlie Finley has soured my stomach for baseball."],"Vidal Sassoon":["It's okay saying sorry, but when you are drunk you say what you really feel.","I just consider being one of the luckiest people in the sense that creativity came to me and it flowed.","Hairdressers are a wonderful breed. You work one-on-one with another human being and the object is to make them feel so much better and to look at themselves with a twinkle in their eye.","We learned to put discipline in the haircuts by using actual geometry, actual architectural shapes and bone structure. The cut had to be perfect and layered beautifully, so that when a woman shook it, it just fell back in.","Most people have excellent necks. Now they cover them with curtains, which is kind of ridiculous. But there are some beautiful necklines that you can cut into and create wonderful backs, as well as bone structure for the face.","For nine years I worked to change what was hairdressing then into a geometric art form with color, perm without setting which had never been done before.","There were so many pretty girls coming into the salon as clients, and others working in the salon. And I thought, 'Hmm. This is rather nice.'","I'll never forget one morning I walked in and I had a hell of a bruise - it had been a difficult night the night before - and a client said to me, 'Good God, Vidal, what happened to your face?' And I said, 'Oh, nothing, madam, I just fell over a hairpin.'","Hair excited me. As the old ways - backcombing, rollers and rigidity - went out of the window, I started to feel the possibilities in front of my eyes.","Hairdressing in general hasn't been given the kudos it deserves. It's not recognised by enough people as a worthy craft.","I was all about my thoughts, my work, my inspiration. I was always in hair.","Bring out the eyes.","My mother had a premonition and she felt that hairdressing would be very very good for me.","Capri on the Amalfi Coast in Italy is my ultimate holiday destination.","A working woman could save a few shillings a week, and then every five weeks she'd come in and we'd cut her hair. She could shampoo it under the shower, swing it and dry it off or just let it dry by itself. It changed the lives of many young girls who'd never had the opportunity to be styled like that before.","The essence is, what can we do next? And will it be good?","I kept thinking I would be spending my life up to my elbows in shampoo.","From my point of view, there is a tremendous amount to be said for secular humanism.","If you have a sense of style and purpose and will you don't want to compromise.","You must always do what you feel is right.","I don't sort of sit in a chair and pompously feel proud of myself about all the things we might have accomplished.","So I was shampooing at 14. But I've always thought that had I the opportunity for an education, I would have been an architect. There's no question about it.","I got a telegraph from my mother who said that my step-father had had a heart attack, come home and earn a living. So I went back to England and the only thing I knew to earn any cash was through hairdressing.","It's hard to give advice. There are so many people, how do you give major advice to a group of people, it's very presumptuous.","You either create something and you keep it a secret and you die with it, or you can benefit the craft.","If you don't look good, we don't look good.","If you get hold of a head of hair on somebody you've never seen before, cut beautiful shapes, cut beautiful architectural angles and she walks out looking so different - I think that's masterful.","It was my mother's idea. Her feeling was that I didn't have the intelligence to pick a trade myself.","My greatest regret is selling my company.","Everything about morality and obligations I owe to football.","My mother left me for seven years in an orphanage.","Judaism is important to me from a tribal point of view.","During the late '20s my father left us. My mother was in a complete hole with no money, and we were evicted.","I was a bit of a rebel.","You never argued with my mother. You couldn't win.","When I was about 10 I ran away to see my father. He couldn't have cared less. He just took me back as soon as he could.","I'm a great jazz fan.","Mary Quant is my favourite fashion designer.","'The Pianist' is a movie I could watch over and over again.","To me hair dressing means shape. It's very important that the foundations should be right.","Like most ghetto kids I knew it was important to be 'somebody' so I became a good soccer player, because excelling at a sport seemed to make you special.","I came home after a year and although my profession was only hairdressing, I knew I could change it.","I was born in 1928 and by 1931 the Depression was beginning to mount.","Women were going back to work, they were assuming their own power. They didn't have time to sit under the dryer.","Realizing our society as it is, without theology dogmatically telling us how we should react to it, and being humane toward that society, that is all that we're sure of.","I believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy."],"Vidya Balan":["Life has been kind to me. I am happy with the love and appreciation that I have been getting throughout my career. I feel blessed.","I'm not fashionable, and I know nothing about fashion, but I have my individual style, and style is eternal.","I don't bother about how people feel about me. What matters to me is how I feel about them.","Women are blessed with energy - a power which is unique. I have been very fortunate to have played strong women and explored their strengths through my films.","Let's face it; people are doing everything online these days. So if they are going to watch my movies, I'm happy as long as it's being bought legally and being exhibited legally, as long as they are paying even a small fee for it. I'm just anti-piracy. If it's a legitimate way of watching film online, then I'm very happy.","I enjoy the sari. I think it's the sexiest garment ever. It shows you the right amount, it covers the right amount, it's extremely versatile, it suits every body type, it suits every face.","Fortunately, I've never been very conscious and inhibited of what I have to do. The camera's my soul mate.","I am vegetarian. I have a sweet tooth, so I try and avoid desserts. I binge maybe once a month. I eat every two hours, whether it is a Marie biscuit or just a slice of apple. As a result, my metabolism has improved, and this is a huge contributor to weight loss.","I take one day at a time. I am not someone to define my goals.","I think the beautiful thing about the past is that it leads you to the present.","Being traditional is a choice for me. South Indian families bring up their children with a sense of freedom, self-respect and self-value. We do whatever we have to with earnestness and honesty, including being uninhibited. Yet we hold onto our roots.","Thumbs up to the buxom woman. Size zero is boring!","I was a happy person before marriage. I'm definitely happier after marriage.","The stakes are high on every film now because there's the opening weekend. The first week is extremely crucial; increasingly, films are being judged in terms of opening day, opening weekend, then first week. People are going berserk promoting their films.","A painter once told me that I'm like the Khajuraho, which you see once but which remains with you forever. I thought that was exquisite.","Sexuality, desirability has nothing to do with body type. It has to do with how you feel from within. I was at my fattest best in 'The Dirty Picture,' and I was called the most desirable. So there you go. I am quite well-endowed, so I have no complaints.","As women, we are constantly criticising and judging ourselves in terms of our body, how we dress, what profession we take up, how we fare in that. Indian women are gifted with certain body types and features, which is healthy, and we should accept that.","I eat every two hours. I sleep for eight hours. I have lots of water. I pray to keep calm. Most importantly, I have a smile on my face.","Weight used to be an issue. I was always fat as a child. And everyone used to tell me, 'You've got such a pretty face; why don't you lose some weight?' Over the years I've realised that my body is a certain type, and I have learned to accept it.","It gives a different kind of high when, as an actor, I get to submit myself to the character I play.","Promotions can be seen in two ways - either you hate them, and they're a burden, and you are getting through with it, or you can enjoy them. I decided early on that I was going to enjoy them. I did 43 interviews in a day for 'Kahaani.'","Marriage is something I'd recommend everyone to try, if you find the right person, of course.","I'm someone who believes in 'live and let live,' and that applies to everything.","I don't think my competition is with the heroes. I don't think I'm competing with anyone. I don't mean to sound Zen, but genuinely, when I stopped competing with anything is when I started enjoying my work, and that brought out the best in me. I'm living in a universe of my own, and I'm enjoying that. I love to appreciate other people's work.","Cinema is about people, and we are a very emotional people. That is why you see those ups and those downs and those colours. That is what Indian cinema is about.","I remember someone telling me that when he saw the back of a woman's head, he knew that was the woman he was going marry. I laughed that away as silly talk. But I guess when a relationship has to happen, it happens seamlessly. Your partner just walks into your life.","I started feeling secure in every way once I began to accept myself the way I was. Whether that was emotional, financial or professional security, all of it came and embraced me because I embraced myself.","I can't cook to save my life.","I could live in a sari; I was born to wear a sari.","I have never thought of winning an Oscar. Rather, I never thought I would get the Padma Shri. I think God has been kind to me. I think getting Oscar award is not too far away.","I think a woman should be wholesome, voluptuous and sizzling!","I've wanted recognition; I wanted success; I wanted appreciation; I love the perks of being in the movies. I love the fame that comes with it - but that's why I became an actor.","All over the world, people are looking at India and saying 'wow', and that's because we have begun to say 'wow' ourselves.","My father said that I could always become an actress, but I couldn't go back to college later in life. So I had to first finish my education, and then I could do what I wanted. At the time, I was not pleased, but now, I can't thank him enough. My parents were absolutely right.","Women need to learn to value themselves. But that has to be inculcated in men as much as women.","My idea of an actor is to be different persons with different roles. Every time a script interests me, I look for interesting characters because I intend to completely transport myself into it. This happens only because I am a very greedy actor. I am not part of the rat race because I am living a dream.","I dress according to the requirement of the film, as a true actor. Off the camera, I'm just me. I have my preferences and my personal style. Before I step out, I look into the mirror just to confirm that my style is intact. Beyond this, it doesn't matter.","Frankly speaking, it's only the script that matters to me the most. If I like the script, then I just commit to myself and go ahead with it. But I also look at the commitment and confidence of the director of the film because it's him who will shape the film.","I always wanted to live the lives of different people, portray characters that are different from me. But I could have done that in front of a mirror, also, I didn't need to do films for that. At the end of the day, it's this fame, recognition, popularity, the love and appreciation you get from your audience that drives you.","I work out at home. I don't have a gym, but I use light weights. I do calisthenics, which is basically using your own body weight, like you do in yoga, to strengthen your core. I also do a bit of cardio.","To each his own, but I just think that we women have a certain body type. As Indian women, we have a beautiful body type. And I believe in the celebration of curves. Whether it's Salma Hayek, Penelope Cruz, Zeenat Aman or Shilpa Shetty, they are very curvaceous and beautiful. I don't know why anyone would want to fight that.","I eat to live and not the other way around. As a vegetarian, I'm not at all fussy about food and can make do with anything.","Black coffee is the latest fad I have picked up. Then there are my endless cups of chai! I'm trying to cut down and keep it to no more than three cups a day.","I like all things natural, and I love being Indian. So clothes-wise, I love wearing Indian. Does my wearing a salwar kameez instead of a dress make me less of an actor, less of a person?","My so-called bad dress-sense phase happened when I was confused - I think I was taking advice all too often, without listening to my inner voice. Add to the fact that I was a little overweight; so every wrong 'outfit' got compounded all that much.","It's never been difficult for me to say no. I have never given excuses like I don't have dates. I have never over-quoted to avoid a project. I simply say that while the script might be good, I can't connect with it. My strategy is that while I wouldn't want anyone to waste my time, I shouldn't be doing that, either, with others.","From Shakespeare to Robi Thakur, everyone has written stories about people and incidents around them. There is no creativity minus reality irrespective of how flowery or abstract you make it.","There will always be a slight difference between the reel and the real. Even my family might know 99 per cent about me, but there will be this one per cent about me that nobody will ever know. Being in this profession, I am fine with biopics or movies inspired by real-life-characters.","Only conviction sells. Well, when we are insecure, we really don't have that 100 percent conviction. Once we have it, we can tide over everything."],"Viet D. Dinh":["The under-funded and over-extended United States Patent and Trademark Office does not have the resources to adequately evaluate the burgeoning number of applications, and too many low-quality patents are being issued as a result.","The reforms proposed by the Patent Reform Act of 2007 are precisely the type of congressional action needed. The Act will remove obstacles to growth and restore balance to the patent system.","Like its Senate counterpart, H.R. 1908 is the product of years of bipartisan collaboration. And now, by passing S. 1145, the U.S. Senate has a similar opportunity to restore our patent regime to its rightful position of protecting inventors' property rights and spurring innovation. These are values that all Americans should rally behind.","I think that one of the primary roles of an attorney, and certainly we try to teach it here to our students, is that you counsel compliance with the law. The lawyer, more than simply being a mouthpiece for the client and advocating at whatever cost the client's interest, is also an officer of the court in questions that appear before the court.","I think an ethical lawyer would absolutely refuse, if he or she had knowledge that this is the purpose for which her work would be used, that is, to conceal a fraudulent scheme from federal regulators.","I think that the question is very clear-cut, not only as a matter of ethics, but also as a matter of law, that a lawyer should not be aiding and abetting in a fraudulent scheme, and part of that aiding and abetting would be to draw up subsequent documents in order to conceal the true nature of the scheme from federal investigators."],"Viggo Mortensen":["Life is short and the older you get, the more you feel it. Indeed, the shorter it is. People lose their capacity to walk, run, travel, think, and experience life. I realise how important it is to use the time I have.","There's no excuse to be bored. Sad, yes. Angry, yes. Depressed, yes. Crazy, yes. But there's no excuse for boredom, ever.","One of the best pieces of advice I ever got was from a horse master. He told me to go slow to go fast. I think that applies to everything in life. We live as though there aren't enough hours in the day but if we do each thing calmly and carefully we will get it done quicker and with much less stress.","You know, real life doesn't just suddenly resolve itself. You have to keep working at it. Democracy, marriage, friendship. You can't just say, 'She's my best friend.' That's not a given, it's a process.","I like the detail work of telling a story in small pieces, as is done in movie-making, and also the long leap of faith needed to see a theatre performance through each night. Both require focus and self-discipline.","I suppose a good director is like a teacher. I think that someone like David Cronenberg was very much like a teacher, because there's an openness, but a certain set of rules of behavior, and a certain conduct expected. But there's an atmosphere that's relaxed and conducive to exploration, and that is created by someone like Cronenberg.","As far as money goes, there's a saying in Denmark: 'Your last suit doesn't have any pockets.' You can't take it with you. You can make all the money you want, but who cares?","Be kind. It's worthwhile to make an effort to learn about other people and figure out what you might have in common with them. If you allow yourself to be somewhat curious - and if you get into the habit of doing that - it's the first step to being open minded and realizing that your points of view aren't totally opposite.","Life is short and the older you get, the more you feel it. Indeed, the shorter it is.","Travel is one of the best anti-war weapons that there are. I've been to Iran, and if you're there you see little kids, cops, old people, cemeteries. Once you see that, you can't say, 'Oh, Iran, let's bomb them.'","If you're trying to please everyone, then you're not going to make anything that is honestly yours, I don't think, in the long run.","If you don't find some way to discuss what's going on inside you, it can come out in other ways that are self-destructive.","Some people who like dogs don't like cats, but I'm not like that.","Some actors learn the habit of promoting themselves as a brand - by dressing in a certain way, by going out with a certain person - it gives them what they obviously want, which is to keep a level of fame. I'm not putting it down.","There's no sense in doing something, especially if it's a hard job, if you can't have a little fun.","Like most people I can be lazy, so it's nice to have a goal or deadline or reason to work out. I feel better when I get to exercise, or when I'm outdoors. I like to hike, swim and run, and I love to play soccer.","A little recognition is not a bad thing because it means people appreciate your work. The only problem is when you can't walk down the street or have a meal without people looking at you. I want to be the one looking at people.","Awards for arts, where you make comparisons, don't make much sense.","I like a twisted sense of humour. On 'A History of Violence,' David Cronenberg and I would be doing the grimmest scenes and laugh a lot.","I try to research or make up for myself what happened in any character's life. From when he was born until the first page of the script. I fill in the blanks.","I'm not afraid of death, but I resent it. I think it's unfair and irritating.","Most actors can't make any kind of living.","Saying you are a patriot does not make you one; wearing a flag pin does not in itself mean anything at all.","I don't like the 'must', the 'always', and the 'never' words. I don't like 'no' either.","It's hard not to get depressed when you pay attention to the world and how strangely and corrupt the people in it sometimes behave.","I'm not that involved in personal grooming. But I try not to be offensive to people.","What art does is it makes you feel alive and makes you feel like you're connected.","With few exceptions, one ought always do what one is afraid of.","Yes, I would agree that America, just like Spain was in the 17th Century, is the main empire of the world and they are the ones who, on the surface, are the most pushy: pushing their language, pushing their culture - or what there is of it - pushing by force their system on others.","Photography, painting or poetry - those are just extensions of me, how I perceive things; they are my way of communicating.","We live as though there aren't enough hours in the day, but if we do each thing calmly and carefully we will get it done quicker and with much less stress.","More often than not, the experience of shooting the movie has been disappointing and the end product has been a mere shadow of what I hoped it would be. But immersing myself in the story - that's what I like best of all.","I really enjoyed working with New Zealanders as crew members, as teammates. They're great, and it's a beautiful country. It's one of the most beautiful places I've ever been, and I've traveled quite a bit.","I think that every person has many, many people inside of them. We change our personality depending on who we are talking to or what situation we are in.","I like stories that leave you wanting more, leave you wondering, but don't tell you everything.","When you're under stress as a human being, you behave oddly and your relationships with people become strained.","Ignorance breeds antipathy. Until I got to know how computers worked, I didn't want anything to do with them. I said, 'Well, why do I need them? I write letters.' Which I still do.","I think that people who get to a certain position, and then try to ferociously defend it or build on it, it's kind of a dead-end street. You see people becoming miserable that way.","I'm just looking as always for something that's stimulating and I hope to find a good story that's a challenge, whether it's big or small. Or that it finds me. I don't have like a career plan. Maybe I should, but I don't.","In a movie, you're raw material, just a hue of some color and the director makes the painting.","I have never been in a natural place and felt that it was a waste of time. I never have. And it's a relief. If I'm walking around a desert or whatever, every second is worthwhile.","Jung viewed Freud as a mentor, but he never wanted to be anybody's disciple.","Freud was the son of a Jewish merchant who had to move his whole family to Vienna because he couldn't get work. He, as a boy, had to watch his father be mocked and abused on the street for being Jewish... You develop a thick skin and you develop a certain kind of wit to defend yourself.","A lot of times, movies that are in the top 10 lists or maybe even win Baftas or Oscars, you then watch them a year later and you go, 'Maybe it wasn't so great.'","It doesn't take that many years for a kid to realise that they're going to die. It's always there in the back of their mind the rest of their lives.","If in my twenties I'd gotten one of the two-dozen roles that I did screen tests for and almost got, I think I would have become bored with the awards circuit, the whole hype machine.","People like to pigeonhole you. It's easier.","Anyone can identify with those moments in life where circumstances or people inform us that we've strayed from the path of our better nature and intentions. We know what that's like, and we resist it - so as not to feel like we're bad people.","It's not the end of the world if I can't get a film job, or if a movie doesn't turn out well - even though I don't like it when that happens. There are other things I enjoy doing, and I involve myself in them.","'The Road' is about that fear that all parents can have - 'What's going to happen to your child if you're not around?'","It's true that I have a wide range of interests. I like to write and paint and make music and go walking on my own and garden. In fact, gardening is probably what I enjoy doing more than anything else.","I would literally climb out of the cradle while my parents slept, go and crawl off. I did this a couple of times apparently. I'd cross the road and into someone's house, wake them up banging pots and pans in the kitchen.","I have no idea what 'method actor' means.","I have a work ethic. If I say I'm going to do something, I do it.","One of the most effective tools that the Cheney-Bush junta has used to marginalize dissenting or even mildly inquisitive American citizens has been the accusation of being unpatriotic.","The money I earn from films means I can help the people I want to help - you can do a lot of good if you want to.","I hate divers, like Cristiano Ronaldo, who might be the greatest athlete in the sport, but he's a big baby. If things are going well he's great, but when things are going badly it's the ref's fault, it's his teammates' fault.","You see people on the street yelling and think they're crazy, but maybe they're just happy and expressing what they feel at all times.","Each time I make a movie, it's like a paid scholarship to a different university course.","I realise how important it is to use the time I have. I respect people who want to do that by watching television. I happen to want to read books. But I know I can't read all the books or watch all the movies in one lifetime.","I was raised in Argentina until I was 11 and now I go back there a lot, at least twice a year. It's a country where I feel very comfortable and it represents an important period in my life.","The Holocaust movie is almost a genre in itself these days.","I don't like people who get into fights about football - or anything else.","I try to avoid conflict. I don't want people to be unhappy.","Sometimes you look at a movie and you can see that the actor or actress said, 'I'm taking this onboard because I'm making a ton of money, and not because it's going to be something special.'","You know, Freud accepted his lot very stoically and very well and with a sense of humor. He aged and died gracefully, and there's a lot to be said for that.","I prefer the smaller acting than big histrionics. It's about reacting and looks, which is often underestimated.","I'm not a great fan of monarchy in general, but I have to say the Danish monarchy is closer to the people; it's not as stuffy as the English one.","When I have a day off, I won't spend it at a Hollywood party. I'd rather be at home with paints and a blank canvas.","Nobody really knows anybody completely, even if they've been married to 'em for 53 years, you know?","Those who have the power and should be the most responsible are often the least responsible.","People will like to say that 'Eastern Promises' is brutal, but the only reason they say that is because the scenes stick with them. They are realistic. They are in-your-face and you see the consequences. It's not a bunch of quick editing cuts.","You do need to get lucky, no matter how talented you are.","It's very rare you get a great script just handed to you, or sent to you, by someone you don't know.","I think every family is dysfunctional, and some manage to control it better than others.","In the end, the actor's main power is the power to say, 'No.'","Adult characters are all the things they've encountered over time. But kids haven't accumulated all the life experience, all the regrets. They tend to be more in the moment, more willing to play, to be joyful.","I was raised speaking English and Spanish. And I also speak Danish. And I can get by in French and Italian. I've acted in Spanish and English, but when something has to do with emotions, sometimes I feel I can get to the heart of the matter better in Spanish.","To be an artist, you don't have to compose music or paint or be in the movies or write books. It's just a way of living. It has to do with paying attention, remembering, filtering what you see and answering back, participating in life.","In a way, editing is not unlike the movies. The best books, just like the best movies, are a collaboration. They're only as good as the compromise made between the artists involved.","I grew up with horses when I was a kid in Argentina. I like them. I respect them. I'm careful around them. You never know what they're going to do. They're endlessly interesting. I've had some good acting partners that were horses over the years.","In terms of the movie business, being in a 'Lord of the Rings' has given me more interesting options as work.","You can't really divorce yourself and your life from the world you live in.","Looking at acting, in the movies or the theater, and the way I like to look at it, it's just an extension of childhood play... Kids play and imagine in a very intense fashion and they don't need any director telling them, 'You really have to believe in it.' They believe in it completely.","I mean, any movie or story that makes you accept and be grateful for something about your life is doing something right.","Toronto Film Festival is one of those festivals where there are 400 movies, and unless you have a distributor who is super confident and puts a lot of money into it, sometimes movies can go unwatched or unnoticed.","I like movies that leave you with something to think about, to discuss, to debate, you know?","At the end of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century in Austria, there was a lot of anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism in Austria was much more pervasive than in Germany. And Austrians took to Nazi ideas and anti-Semitism much more readily than Germans did, really.","I'm sort of contrary and stubborn sometimes. When everybody says, 'You have to read this book! You have to read this book!' I'm like 'Oh, I'll get around to it.'","I'm optimistic about people and about the planet and about nature. I think it's resilient, like people are.","Kids accept where they are because they don't know the past. They know what they have; they know where they are.","You know, 'Viggo' is a pretty dorky name in Denmark. It's like 'Oswald' or something. It's a very old Scandinavian name, at least 1,000 years old.","I like naturally occurring film grain, and what happens to film when it's under- and over-exposed.","Most movies are lucky to have one moment, one shot that you look at and you always remember that moment and that scene.","I've never played a Dane in a movie. I've had offers to be in Danish movies, including for some good directors, but I either had a job at the time or, when I was available, the movie just didn't happen. Hopefully someday I'll do one.","To be honest, I don't really care about any pope. It's not something I think about much, to be quite honest with you.","I don't think you get to be pope without making some enemies, like you do when you're president.","My goal is just to make movies, whether they're big or small, that I'd like to see 10 years from now.","I love rehearsing, but a lot of directors don't, and some actors don't.","People talk about method actors, meaning someone that's prepared very, very well, or whatever they mean when they talk about it. But the right method is whatever works for you. And what works for me on any given day is going to be different.","Usually the characters I play are men of few words, who communicate in non-verbal ways.","Any nominations a movie gets helps to raise the level of curiosity in the public, so in that sense awards and nominations are important.","When I land in a country and they ask for 'occupation,' I always just put 'artist.' I think that covers all of it.","I've been lucky to learn by playing all kinds of roles and watching all kinds of really good cinematographers, actors, and directors for many years before people were even aware of me in terms of audience.","Further devastation of the air, land and sea is obviously a very real possibility, unless the attitudes of politicians and all who irresponsibly exploit our natural resources change significantly in the very near future and all collaborate and sacrifice for the good of the planet.","On a practical level, poetry isn't something anybody has really made a great living at. I might sell some books and, once in a while, someone might pay to hear me read.","Pinochet and Barack Obama both have the same primary goal, and that's to be president and stay president as long as allowed.","One of the main ways that leadership stays in power is by, in various ways, convincing people that they should just let those who are in government govern: 'Trust us. Trust me. Just let us take care of things. Stay out of it.' Your opinions don't really matter. You are isolated. You are insignificant.","If there's one thing I've learned from traveling, it's that it is definitely more important how you are than where you are. You can say, 'Oh, I hate X city, I hate that country, or I prefer this city,' but it's a little bit up to you to find some kind of happiness.","It's amazing to me that Glenn Beck can be on the cover of 'Time,' and there can be a whole article about him basically saying, 'Well, you know, he's controversial.' It's like, 'No, he's a dangerous idiot who needs the help of a good psychiatrist!'","Being an actor, imitating to the point of inhabiting the lives of others, may simply be a way of continuing to do what I learned to do as a boy - to travel, mentally and physically.","Every year I hear people complain that the quality of screenplays and movies is declining. In my opinion, the vast majority of scripts written - as well as most movies that are released - are not very original, well-written, or interesting. It has always been that way, and I think it always will be.","I've never been conscious of having any real career plan, and I do not have a wish-list of actors, directors, screenwriters, or cameramen I'm hoping to work with. Life, I feel, has a way of leading us to the right situations and people, or at least to interesting ones.","When I make a movie, I don't break it down and analyze it. I could but it would get in the way of doing a job - on instinct based on all the research we did going in. you want to trust yourself and your director and your acting partners in the circumstances you're shooting. I don't like to have any kind of overview.","I don't think Adam Sandler or Will Ferrell fear competition from me in their arena.","In a lot of places in the United States and certainly even more places around the world, the image of the cowboy has become, for some people, a negative one. The word 'cowboy' implies a strong, stubborn individual whose individualism depends on pulling down other people's individualism.","The first decade of your life is really important; it's formative.","I have a multicultural background, so I tend to have an open mind about things, and I find other cultures interesting.","With any character I have played, there's infinite possibilities for how they might behave, depending on who they are talking to or how they react to things.","Sometimes a scene works and acting is the easiest thing in the world and you don't have to do much of anything - just enjoy yourself and listen to the other actor. When it doesn't work, then every actor has different ways of dealing with the impasse. Sometimes you use memories from the past. Whatever. It depends from job to job.","The best thing an actor can be is flexible, because all directors are different and all actors are different.","Be kind. It's worthwhile to make an effort to learn about other people and figure out what you might have in common with them.","I'd like to, when it's all said and done, say that I have at least a few stories that I feel proud of.","'The Road' was a movie that has a good reputation, even though it wasn't released very well, but that's a movie I'm very proud of.","Like most people - unless they're very practised at it or have no warm blood at all in their veins - I feel a little apprehensive about the red carpet. It's always a bit bewildering when people are taking pictures and asking questions before the ceremony.","This basic thing I always do: 'What happened between the character's birth, and page one of the script?' Anything that's not in the story, I'll fill in the blanks.","When we shot 'The Lord of the Rings,' we had special permission to film in wild areas of New Zealand that could be accessed only by helicopter. They would drop us off and we would work all day, and they'd pick us up and take us out again.","When I heard Puerto Ricans in New York City, it sounded very strange. And the first time I heard someone from Spain, I thought they had a speech impediment!","I don't have a BlackBerry or whatever you call it. And there is something to be said for being isolated and out of phone range, because you can fall into a habit to such a degree that you don't even realise that you've lost something: silence.","You can't really go back to where you came from. I don't think any of us can.","When I was a little boy, I rode, but I didn't own horses.","For 'Hidalgo,' I just spent as much time around horses as I could, which made sense.","I know people who prepare their roles in such a way that they technically look ahead and memorize their gestures, and then they stick to it. Those that are technically proficient enough can make it seem natural, but they do that and don't really take in what other people are doing.","I'm not afraid of death, but I resent it. I think it's unfair and irritating. Every time I see something beautiful, I not only want to return to it, but it makes me want to see other beautiful things. I know I'm not going to get to all the places I want to go.","I know I said I wanted to live forever and I would never be bored, but the reality is, it's probably kind of sad to live forever if you're the only one sticking around.","I have a roof over my head. I had a breakfast, and a lot of people in the world can't say that. I'm not going to complain about being interviewed.","You know, real life doesn't just suddenly resolve itself. You have to keep working at it.","When there is conflict, it's good to step away, even for five minutes, because you could say terrible things that you can't take back, so it's best to walk away.","I have a publishing company of books by me and books of others. It drew people to poetry readings and photo exhibitions and painting exhibitions that I've been doing for years before that.","Walking down the street in any town or city in the world and having people look at you and start talking to you, convinced that they know you as well or better than they do members of their own family, that's just an odd phenomenon. But I mean, I wouldn't say it was a bad thing. It's an interesting thing.","I've never had a problem with people paying attention to what you're doing and say they find that they liked it.","As a kid I read Jules Verne, H. G. Wells, and a few others. As an adult have admired Leonardo da Vinci's drawings and notebooks.","I think, on a surface level, people are surprised to see me playing such a passive role in 'Good.'","I think maybe because I do other things and they mean as much to me as movie acting, it takes the onus off me. It's not the end of the world if I can't get a film job, or if a movie doesn't turn out well - even though I don't like it when that happens.","'The Road' is about that fear that all parents can have. What's going to happen to your child if you're not around? It takes those concerns to an extreme. In the film, without me the boy has no food, no shelter, no resources at all.","I'm an optimist; I always hope that each new script is going to be a great story.","In my opinion, the vast majority of scripts written - as well as most movies that are released - are not very original, well-written, or interesting. It has always been that way, and I think it always will be.","In a lot of ways, I envy someone like Omar Sharif who lived in a hotel for decades.","I'm certainly curious about people. As a kid, I moved around a lot. I was raised in a lot of different places, and thanks to working in the movies, I've gotten to keep traveling. I've always been interested in other cultures and languages.","It's just like with people. You're going to get along better working with them - human or equine - if you ask politely rather than demand that they do things.","In principle, I think the idea of rewarding a good effort is interesting, but movies are generally different from each other as are performances and the conditions on how the performances are given and how they're edited and so forth.","I'm very comfortable in Argentina. I was raised there as a baby and stayed there until I was 11 years old, so the first decade of my life or my formative years were spent in Argentina. I stayed in tune with the food, music and language.","It's always interesting to play a character that obviously has a secret."],"Vijay Kumar":["Drinking a cup of coffee with your eyes closed isn't a sophisticated task for a person, but it's hard for a robot.","If you want a robot to maneuver aggressively, it has to be small. As you scale things down, the 'moment of inertia' - the resistance to angular motion - drops dramatically.","Robots are good at things that are structured.","When you play piano, your left hand and right hand are synced. Your brain basically has a clock, so that the right hand knows that 0.3 seconds after I hit this key, I need to hit that one. And the right hand knows not to hit keys that the left hand is playing, so the hands do not collide.","I have this dream that the first responders to 911 calls will not be law enforcement personnel but robots. Robots can put eyes and ears on the scene much faster than you can with policemen or women.","Normally, in the presence of radiation, communication links fail. But with autonomous robots, you don't need communications.","If I say 'Find me an interesting painting' to Google, someday a robot could go around the Picasso museum and take a picture for me.","Our nano-quadrotor robots are made to be as lightweight as possible: less than a fifth of a pound and palm-sized. They can do an aerial backflip in half a second, accelerate at two Gs, and fly rotor blade to rotor blade in three-dimensional formations - and they do all this autonomously.","The big mathematical challenge for flying robots is making them move in six dimensions: x, y, z, pitch, yaw and roll. We create 3-D obstacle courses in the lab - windows, doors, hula-hoops taped to posts - and ask the robots to fly through. It looks like a Harry Potter Quidditch match.","Clearly, humans will always have a role to play in emergency response for law enforcement. But if there's an emergency, if there's a 911 call, the question is, do you want a human dashing off to respond to it right away?","We can make aircrafts that can navigate a maze of hallways."],"Vijay Mallya":["At age 26, I was chairman of UB Group but living like a 26-year-old. I lived my age. Which youngster doesn't like a Ferrari? Which youngster doesn't like a good time?... but my contemporaries were R. S. Goenka and Dhirubhai Ambani, captains of the industry but twice my age. You wouldn't necessarily expect them to be driving around in Ferraris.","Whenever I do something, it is rooted in the Indian opportunity.","It's not quite right to be sitting outside India and to be judging what is happening in India.","I run my own world, because I very firmly believe that my destiny, my future is in my hands and I don't want to blame anybody else for the path that I take.","One of India's biggest advantages is our young demographic and that we have a youthful population that is indeed our future.","I live life what I consider to be normal.","I am an Indian to the core.","Rather than spend millions getting film stars, I am quite happy to be brand ambassador myself.","Any serious airline has to look at a worldwide network.","I'm not a T.G.I.F. guy. I get off a plane at 2 o'clock in the morning and I'm looking for my secretary because I want to know what's going on.","I work hard and I play hard, too. There is nothing wrong with that.","I live the way I want to live, and I don't comment on the way that other people live.","Banks are there to support businesses that have justifiable needs.","I do not believe in hypocrisy.","I am pretty tough as a boss.","Everybody keeps saying that India's a poor country. Yes, we have poverty. But I blame the government of India, the political establishment, for their failure to educate and therefore their failure to control the poverty.","India has given me everything. It has made me Vijay Mallya.","I'm no hardened criminal who the authorities need to hunt.","If you want India to lower tariffs and facilitate more free trade, then I think Indian producers also have a right to enter the European market.","I am an honest, straight guy.","I spend my own money, not other people's money.","I think that the poorest of the poor... look up to wealthy and successful Indians with some degree of respect and pride.","Our culture in India is not a culture where we grudge each other.","My father was very clear; I had to have an ordinary upbringing. I was put to work as a lowly-paid trainee after college. I didn't like it at the time, but I can't help but feel that that was probably the best thing for me.","I think it is better when people with their own businesses and means of income join politics as there is some degree of honesty and integrity.","I'm a person who promotes the concept of accountability to a great extent, and I've spoken in the Parliament and reinforced the need for accountability.","I don't like to leave anything unfinished on my desk before I travel."],"Vijay Sethupathi":["Once, when I was driving my bike with my helmet on, two girls recognized me by just looking at my eyes.","I was active on Facebook for a while, responding to comments and thanking fans for their appreciation. But I found that the Facebook feed was numbing my emotions. I'd see an extraordinarily tragic news item, and even before I could react to it, see a hilarious meme right below it. This was confusing me.","Caste has divided us. I wish it should be completely abolished from our society.","If you go to a theme park, there will be so many rides. You will get an exciting experience in each of them. Like that, every film is an experience that entertains you. Some films will touch your heart. Some will touch you emotionally. There is nothing more than that.","When my parents force-fed me healthy food, they were confident they were giving me the best. But now, when I feed my children, I am not sure if what I am giving them is safe. Politics and pesticides are destroying our food culture.","I have always felt that doing too much of homework makes the performance look plastic. I don't even watch the monitor after I finish my scene because I can't reprise it. I just go with the flow.","Planning bores me. I like to go with the flow. Being whimsical is nice, occasionally. It keeps things fresh; there's no expectation.","Politicians are dividing us based on caste lines.","There's no challenge involved in any kind of role. I don't have to prove or impress anybody.","The day I became a hero, my dream was realised. Everything else is a bonus.","We have to eradicate caste.","I had no interest in cinema until I was 24 years old. My friends had posters of their favourite stars in their houses, but I was far from a film buff - very detached from films.","Director Jai Krishna is an optimist who has a never-say-die attitude. He has impressed me thoroughly with his faith in the industry. Not many are aware of the fact that this man had to wait for almost 30 years in this industry to direct 'Vanmam,' his first film.","I was not a fussy kid and had a good appetite. Only, I was not happy to eat keerai and vegetables.","If you start worrying about risks, you might as well stay inside the womb.","Your present is shaped by your yesterday, but you don't have to advertise it.","I was always under the impression that acting is an innate gift. One of the first things I heard them say at Koothu-P-Pattarai was that actors should realise the art of acting through their training.","I believe life is an 'experience ball.' You throw it at someone, it picks up their response... it grows. You play with that ball, learning what it teaches you.","I don't take any project lightly. Every project is important for me. In fact, every scene in every film is important.","I worked as an accountant in an auditor's office, at a textile showroom, a telephone booth, and a fast-food joint while studying. My dad found it odd, but he never interfered in any of my decisions.","I want to make my kind of films but make them work commercially, too. When my presentation meets the director's imagination, the result will be great.","I am an artist who is ready to grab interesting roles that comes my way.","I never take credit for my movie's success. I am the face of the movie, but there are numerous unsung heroes behind the scene. From the director, cameraman and editor to the light boy, everyone knows how difficult it is to satisfy the audience.","A new character is like bringing a new human being into your life.","I will do whatever I can to become the character. I have no right to distract the audience from the mood of the film.","I came to cinema for money. I had to settle a loan of Rs 10 lakh. I had no other go, so I thought I'd try my luck in films. I was earning Rs 25,000 at that time. It was not even enough for my family.","I used to be very photogenic. My brother took a lot of pictures of me in Dubai. I thought maybe I could be a movie star. There was a hurdle, though - I didn't know anything about films.","Why are numbers so important? I take up a film I like, give it my best, and move on.","I'm self-taught. Even today, on the sets, I probe the lightmen, the stunt artistes... they are from a period I've not seen; I can visualise it through them.","When an actor decides to play a character, he must exude some sort of charisma and look relatable, even if he is playing the role of a really unattractive person.","I surrender to my directors. I do that because I respect them immensely. In fact, a director's talent scares me. I admit that they're more intelligent than me, and I submit to that, as an assistant director does. Even when I have suggestions to make, I don't state them strongly.","One of my biggest drawbacks is my inability to maintain my physique. I put on weight for 'Soodhu Kavvum' and never managed to shed it. Luckily, that look suited a few films, including 'Orange Mittai.'","If I spend 10 days at home, I'll be dying to get back to the set. I love the thrill of a good dialogue, the buzz of shooting.","I am an actor who doesn't believe in carrying an 'image' in the industry. I don't want to get trapped in an image.","To be honest, many of my well-wishers want me to play the solo lead in films. Maybe, it's time to think about it. In fact, I have cut down on signing up multi-starrer films.","As an artist, all I want is to be a part of good films.","I have both joyful and heartbreaking moments in life, even now. Stardom doesn't give us everything.","If a film is suitable for family viewing, it should remain so, and if a film has some adult content, it should remain so, and these genres should never be mixed and spoil the vision of the story teller.","We never take people seriously when they are alive, but once they are gone, we always think that we should have treated them better.","I can not stay at the place when a stranger starts talking to me. I will try to cut the speech as quick as possible and move away. I had to break this inhibition before becoming an actor.","I prepare my style of biriyani by sauting sliced onion, tomato, green chilli, ginger garlic and add required water and rice. If I end up adding a tad too much of salt, I used to add curd to balance it.","The food we eat is our identity. The youth of the nation must save our food culture and traditions. If not, it will affect future generations.","If I am ever forced to choose between my identity as a Tamilian and an award from the central government, I will choose the former.","I am always for and with the Tamil people.","During script narrations, if I feel the screenplay mood jumping abruptly, I tell the director, and they work on it.","All my films have turned out well only because of the director's brilliance, not because of me.","The energy of first-time directors is tremendous. They work beyond the limits for a hit in this competitive industry.","I don't overact, so people think that I naturally act well. I underplay my roles, and that has worked for me.","I don't differentiate a film as off-beat or commercial, because I just don't understand the difference. 'Naanum Rowdy Thaan,' for example, wasn't written for me. It came to me by chance after two or three other heroes turned it down. I agreed to do the role, as I liked the script immensely.","I'm excited and nervous about every film; once I understand the medium fully, I'll relax.","If you don't see me act, my work is done. The actor must never take the character beyond the scope of the movie.","I'll give the director what he wants, but please explain the requirement. If it reaches me, then there's communication.","Whenever I am shooting in Chennai, I spend most of my time with my wife and kids. Sometimes, I take my kids to the shooting spot, and they just love it.","I am not bothered about my career graph, as I am someone who doesn't believe in planning things.","I've never consciously done 'safe' commercial projects; luckily, they have done well.","'Purampokku' was one of those rare films made just like it was narrated.","The very expectation that an actor loves to experiment becomes a shackle that is difficult to snap out of.","As an actor, you need to use everything at your disposal.","The story is important for any movie, for it is in the film industry, the consumer pays the money before he or she gets the product. So, the responsibility of delivering a good product is on us.","Audience come with expectations, and our job is to engage them for two hours. We take efforts to make the story more interesting and also present it in such a way that it is liked by all the audience.","Directors are the fulcrum of the movie. They guide us well, not merely rein actors in. Whenever we stray, they bring us back on track.","When I did 'Naanum Rowdy Thaan' with Nayanthara, she was in the peak of her career - I was apprehensive about her willingness to act with me.","My job is to be sincere to my script. I am passionate about what I do.","I don't have a role model.","Education is a basic necessity.","In feature films, I used to be the hero's friend, a regular character. In short films, I played the hero; I got roles where I could work on my character and performance. They made me aware of myself as an actor.","I don't believe a role can be written keeping in mind some actor. Even if such roles exist, I don't pick them because I generally choose roles that I think will suit my image.","Roles should choose an actor and not vice versa.","If you have a meaty part to play, I don't see the harm in being part of multi-starrers. Moreover, I will be happy to be a part of a good film than playing lead roles in some bad films.","There is no hard and fast rule that I only work with debutants. I give prime importance to script, and when that works out, everything else falls in place automatically. In fact, most debutants express interest to work with me.","Acting and directing are two separate disciplines that rarely mix.","Directing films is easier said than done. The job needs a lot of sensibility to put many things in place.","When 'Pizza' released, I was a nobody. Initially, we managed to get only 100 screens. But, after its success, the producers of 'Naduvula Konjam Pakkatha Kaanom' got 150 screens and also released the film in the U.S. Now, distributors are keen to invest in my films because they feel I have face value.","I have to consider the amount of business that my name can do and choose my projects carefully.","'Vikram Vedha' is special because it has taken me to the next level in my career.","I don't want to do films for the fun of it.","It is not that I don't want to sign films, but I don't want to accept any film coming my way.","I don't choose my directors, but I choose my scripts wisely.","Most of my friends are assistant directors.","I used to hang out with a group of aspiring directors before 'Pizza' happened. We used to discuss a lot of stories all the time.","When I listen to a script, it has to be entertaining. People who come to theatre should be happy and entertained.","My father always used to ask me what my aim in life is. I used to tell him I don't have any.","We are actors. We can adapt to any different look for the sake of the story and the character.","As an actor, I always feel that each and every character in my films has to be distinct. The character Thilak that I play in 'Kavan' will be one such unique role in my career.","I am a bad dancer."],"Vijay Singh":["Maybe I should write 'Tiger Who?' on my cap.","The way you play, you need to talk about winning. Don't talk about keeping your card - talk about winning.","I hope she misses the cut. She doesn't belong here.","He started pushing to make birdies and you don't do that when you're down.","If I can hit the ball the way I want to hit it on the range, I'd rather do that than play golf. I just love the feeling of hitting good golf shots.","I'm playing pretty good now, but my ranking doesn't say that. I'm number two.","It doesn't much concern me if Tiger plays in the tournament or no.","In my heart I know what kind of person I am, and that's good enough.","Golf is about knowledge, and studying another player - more than listening to a teacher - is the best way to get it."],"Vijay":["I can't stop people from writing imaginative stories about me entering politics.","Even today, people tell me that the slapstick humour in 'Friends' is the most viewed comedy track on television. Siddique knows the art of mixing slapstick with genuine humour.","My son, Sanjay, and I discuss a lot of things. Like, he gives me feedback on my films and what his friends say at school.","Many use Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes for daily transactions like going to theatres, malls, and trading purpose. People like these are unnecessarily put to inconvenience.","I've the highest respect and regards for Shankar sir. He has taken Tamil cinema to a new level. I would have loved to work with him, but there are some date hassles.","Controversies are part and parcel of making a big film.","I am like a friend to my kids. My wife, Sangeeta, handles their studies, etc.","I liked Michael Jackson and used to practice his steps. I enjoy dancing!","I wanted to get into films, and my parents were against it. I convinced my mom, and finally she convinced my dad. My dad then felt, who best to launch his son than him? So he launched me, and here I am.","As for pressure, there's always the desire to give my best to every film. After all, so many people put in so much of hard work.","My closest friends today are, in fact, my friends from college.","I would like my kids to study well.","Though the demonetisation move should be welcomed, govt should have planned well in advance to ensure that no common man suffer."],"Vijender Singh":["Achievements are precious and timeless, just like the precious metal platinum. And what better way to celebrate milestones in your life than with precious platinum.","I believe, whatever God does, he does it for the good. I always try to look at life like that.","As far as action is concerned, our films have been coming up with some great sequences. In fact, I think Hollywood is copying Bollywood by getting their heroes to bash up 15 guys at a time.","I do a lot of yoga and meditation. It calms my nerves and helps me channelise my energy.","Sportspersons have to reinvent themselves every day. It helps them improve.","Scrutiny has never scared me because I have had detractors all my life.","I always try to see the good in everything, and that gives me strength. Even when I lost in the London Olympics quarterfinals, I said to myself, 'Don't lose heart, God has his own plans.' Actually, life just goes on; you have to accept whatever challenge you face and become stronger.","Jagdish Singh was my basic coach, and he trained me from my very early days in boxing, teaching me the fundamentals of the sport. He was the one who shaped me into a boxer, disciplined me when I required disciplining.","I knew very little or nothing about the Olympics. Having qualified was itself a big achievement for me, and then being there was quite overwhelming. Although I lost in the opening round, but the fact that I fought well was enough for me to take away from Athens.","I think God has it written down for me, that without training and working hard you will never achieve desired results. All three times I have had to toil my way into the Olympics. Talking about pressure, well that is something you have to learn to deal with in sports.","I want to compete in the next Olympics. If I go to Rio, it will be my third time, which is a rare feat for an Indian athlete. For me, Olympics is important because it's the biggest event on earth for a sports person. I hope this time around I come back with a medal.","I have a carbohydrate and protein-rich diet. For breakfast, I typically have two slices of bread with butter or jam, four to five eggs - boiled or fried - a few bananas and a glass of milk.","An incident that left an impression on me was the 1999 sub-junior national boxing championship held in Calcutta. I had trained extremely hard to get there but got kicked out in the first round itself. 'If others can win, why can't you?' I repeatedly asked myself.","When I walk for a designer, I walk the ramp as Vijender Singh, the boxer. I believe that by doing so, boxing will at least, in some way, get promoted in our entertainment industry. Plus, if cricketers can, why can't I?","I'm a big fan of the 'Rocky' series. Given the chance, I'd love to meet Sylvester Stallone. But apart from boxing, I'm an ardent fan of tennis and football.","When you're representing a sport, people are more likely to judge and comment as, unlike other fields, sport permits every viewer to participate to a certain level.","I've grown up with Bollywood, and I continue to enjoy it. But boxing remains my passion.","I have never thought of a full-fledged career in Bollywood because boxing has never left my mind. But you never know.","I eat healthy and don't go by a diet chart. The breakfast is usually heavy, complemented with short frequent meals. My dinner is high on proteins and low on carbohydrates.","I train for around 3-4 hours everyday. It can go up to 6-7 hours when a competition is approaching.","I love going to the spa; it rejuvenates me and leaves me happy.","I love music, and can dance on the desi beats. Punjabi music is my favourite. I listen to artists like Honey Singh. I love his music. I also love watching Bollywood films.","Most athletes are media shy. They keep to themselves and to their training. I'm not saying it is absolutely necessary for them to come out and face the cameras with confidence, but if they do, it will only help them. They will find themselves closer to their fans and will also get their word across more effectively.","I have always liked to get my pictures taken, and I like taking care of my looks. But, I am not one to use beauty products and treatments.","I have prepared myself to be at my peak in London. But in the Olympics, there are so many factors. You need to stay alert all the time, and a lapse of concentration, even for a second, will let you down.","I know my Beijing medal has been a watershed moment in the history of Indian boxing, but personally speaking, I would like to better it in London.","On my wedding day, I gifted my wife a platinum ring."],"Vik Muniz":["Gramacho is the last landfill that allows people in. Brazil is the leading nation in recycling due to its poverty. There are people there surviving from what they find in the garbage.","Garbage is the part of your history you don't want your family to know about.","Creativity is how we cope with creation. While creation sometimes seems a bit un-graspable, or even pointless, creativity is always meaningful.","The really magical things are the ones that happen right in front of you. A lot of the time you keep looking for beauty, but it is already there. And if you look with a bit more intention, you see it.","I'm at this point in my career where I'm trying to step away from the realm of fine arts, because I think it's a very exclusive, very restrictive place to be. What I want to be able to do is to change the lives of people with the same materials they deal with every day.","I took the longest showers of my life after every time I visited Gramacho. It affects the personality of the catadores. They always dress really well, they're very sharp, and when they go out they always wear a lot of perfume because they're very conscious of the possibility of having the smell.","I'm a product of a military dictatorship. Under a dictatorship, you cannot trust information or dispense it freely because of censorship. So Brazilians become very flexible in the use of metaphors. They learn to communicate with double meanings.","I think most people have creative ideas and have very strange, unorthodox impulses of things that they can do with their lives. I've had many of these over the years, but I decided the more important question was, 'When did I start calling this art?'","I was born in Brazil and grew up in the '70s under a climate of political distress, and I was forced to learn to communicate in a very specific way - in a sort of a semiotic black market. You couldn't really say what you wanted to say; you had to invent ways of doing it. You didn't trust information very much.","My first job in Brazil was actually to develop a way to improve the readability of billboards, and based on speed, angle of approach and actually blocks of text. It was very - actually, it was a very good study, and got me a job in an ad agency. And they also decided that I had to - to give me a very ugly Plexiglas trophy for it.","The first time I worked with colors was by making these mosaics of Pantone swatches. They end up being very large pictures, and I photographed with a very large camera - an 8x10 camera. So you can see the surface of every single swatch - like in this picture of Chuck Close. And you have to walk very far to be able to see it.","My grandmother taught me how to read, very early, but she taught me to read just the way she taught herself how to read - she read words rather than syllables. And as a result of that, when I entered school, it took me a long time to learn how to write.","Drawing is not only a way to come up with pictures: drawing is a way to educate your eye to understand visual information, organizing it into a more hierarchical way, a more economical way. When you see something, if you draw often and frequently, you examine a room very differently.","Who wouldn't like to give up normal life? I mean, normal life, you know, is the second worst thing to death itself. I think normality is something that makes everything very static, and I try to make my days, my daily routines, as uneven and rich as possible.","The first five minutes in Gramacho is really overwhelming because all of your senses are being attacked. Visually, too, because your eyes move and see fragments of things you recognize, but not quite, so it's very artistic. Your eyes are moving, then there's the smell, and the noise is unbearable."],"Vikas Swarup":["Mumbai may not be my city. But it is my kind of city.","India may be the soul of world cricket, but IPL is its commercial heart. Just as 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire' changed the ground rules for quiz shows by injecting a massive dose of money into the equation, IPL has changed the dynamics of the cricket economy.","The slums are not a place of despair. Its inhabitants are all working towards a better life.","Tokyo may have more money and Kyoto more culture; Nara may have more history and Kobe more style. But Osaka has the biggest heart.","Twenty20 is cricket on speed. In an era of hectic lifestyles and falling attention spans, it gives spectators more drama and intensity in three hours that they would get from a whole-day match. And even though it is a heady cocktail of money, entertainment and media, at its core it is cricket.","I want to show that the underdog can win. I believe we're all the same: you, a slum girl, my mother.","I am the luckiest novelist in the world. I was a first-time novelist who wasn't awash in rejection slips, whose manuscript didn't disappear in slush piles. I have had a wonderful time.","Sometimes street knowledge can be as important as book knowledge.","Global terror does not respect national boundaries.","Knowledge is not just the preserve of the educated elite. Just because someone has not had a formal education, that does not mean he does not have wisdom and common sense.","It is in the genes of cities to bounce back from disasters - whether natural or man made. The denizens of suburbia have no choice but to survive and move on. But it is the manner in which different cities respond to emergencies that sets them apart.","The fight against international terrorism isn't just a fight against a bunch of misguided extremists; it is a fight to defend the values that we hold dear.","All I can say is that I am not one of those writers who want 100% of their book in the film. I recognize that film is a different medium and the filmmaker must have the right to bring some new elements to the table, provided the soul of the book is preserved.","I don't look at myself as a writer; I am a storyteller.","I am very interested in human-interest stories emerging from modern India. I get my inspiration and daily dose by reading the 'Hindustan Times.'","People don't just want a mindless flick with a superstar; they want to connect more deeply.","I write fast. But it takes me a while to get going. It's very important for me to see my whole plot. I have to see the end first because I like a surprise in the end. Which is why I let characters and plot gestate in my mind.","I get invited to many more literary festivals than I used to because I'm associated with 'Slumdog Millionaire,' the brand. Many more doors have opened up for me as a result of the global success of the film, although I believe that I'm the same person that existed before it.","For me, the day job comes first. That's why I call myself a diplomat who writes, not a writer who masquerades as a diplomat. If the day job demands it, I won't write at all. I write in what I call 'the crevices of my day job', and that comes only on weekends.","I'm the opposite of those writers who believe that my work is sacrosanct and cannot be touched.","I became completely addicted to 'Angry Birds' for a while.","My books are about ordinary people placed in extraordinary situations who are able to draw upon their inner reserves to challenge the status-quo in life and navigate compelling human relationships.","I need to meet people to be able to write.","I think mobility is very important, not only to discover opportunities elsewhere but at times, also to appreciate better what your home town has. Allahabad, for instance, has the feel of a small, tightly-knit community where everyone participates.","Just because someone has gone to an elite school and college does not make him smarter than the person who has grown up on street knowledge.","I am not into the unrealistic realm of magic realism where birds talk.","I am neither a Bengali nor am I from Delhi's St Stephen's. I am an Allahabad boy.","The first thing you have to understand is that I was not desperate to be a writer. I was never a closet writer filing away notes in a cupboard.","Writing is a very lonely occupation. To write you need to concentrate, to concentrate you need to lock yourself away. No distractions; you want your stream of thought uninterrupted.","The writer's is an interior world, a world of the mind.","I did not go to any creative writing workshop; I did not major in literature. If I can write, anyone can write. All it needs is imagination.","My first novel was a challenge to myself. No one had an inkling that I was working on it.","Indian writers have appropriated English as an Indian language, and that gives a certain freshness to the way we write.","My books may highlight corruption, brutality and venality, but they also show that if these things come to light, there is rectification. The voiceless do have a voice; democratic mechanisms and accountability do exist."],"Vikram Chatwal":["Nepotism sometimes can be a lose-lose situation.","Music used to be a lot more about angst for me. Now it's the only form of meditation I do.","Dreams take you beyond what you think you can do in life.","Early in my investment-banking career, I realized I was on a path that others had set out for me.","I guess you could say I'm a model slash hotelier slash actor slash screenwriter.","There is nothing you can do to assuage your conscience when you commit sins. Crime is a spiritual assault on the soul.","My father is quite conservative and religious, and he's been wanting me to get married since I was 15.","I believe in numbers and signs.","Having created a business that is a success, when you are in a nepotistic situation, people who don't do anything themselves, well, it is easy for them to say it's never good enough.","People think money is life and your life is over if you lose it."],"Vikram Patel":["There is no health without mental health; mental health is too important to be left to the professionals alone, and mental health is everyone's business.","If our children are becoming teenagers who are abusive, have mental health issues, and are committing heinous crime, it only means that we have failed them as a society. We have failed to give them a safe, nurturing environment to ensure that they are well-balanced, useful persons in the society.","Mental health can improve overall well-being and prevent other illnesses. And since mental health problems have a serious economic impact on vulnerable communities, making them a priority can save lives and markedly improve people's quality of life.","There is no evidence to show that prohibition has ever had its intended impact. Of course, just as banning beef has reduced beef consumption, banning alcohol will lead to reduced alcohol consumption. But, there appears to be little or no correlation between, say, domestic violence or household impoverishment and prohibition.","Prohibition of substances which give pleasure to people does not work. Addiction is a health problem, not a moral one, and there are many proven strategies which can reduce its burden.","Prohibition, like so many other policies imposed from the moral high ground, typically by those who do not drink, disproportionately affects the poor who resort to illegally brewed alcohol when they want a drink, not infrequently leading to their death, and are more likely to be harassed by the police.","I have known I was destined to live in Goa the moment I first stepped foot on the Panjim docks from the ferry from Mumbai, when I was 18.","I learned so much in Zimbabwe, in particular about the need for humility in our ambition to extend mental health care in countries where there were very few psychiatrists and where the local culture harboured very different views about mental illness and healing. These experiences have profoundly influenced my thinking.","In the end, I do not think we will find the neat boundary between 'normal sadness' and 'clinical depression,' if only because mood is an innate human characteristic, like weight or the length of our hair. However, to reject the very notion of depression as an illness on account of these difficulties is throwing the baby out with the bath water.","The current approach that psychiatry takes almost ignores social worlds in which mental health problems arise and tries to become highly biomedical like other branches of medicine such as cardiology or oncology. But psychiatry has to be far more embedded in people's personal and social worlds.","I trained in medicine in India, and after that, I chose psychiatry as my specialty, much to the dismay of my mother and all my family members who kind of thought neurosurgery would be a more respectable option for their brilliant son.","Those who believe that health is a commodity, on par with cars or computers, fail to grasp the basic economic lesson that health is very vulnerable to exposure to the markets, not least due to the profound asymmetries in power between the providers and consumers.","The difference in the quality of medical care received by people with mental illness is one of the reasons why they live shorter lives than people without mental illness. Even in the best-resourced countries in the world, this life expectancy gap is as much as 20 years. In the developing countries of the world, this gap is even larger.","It is easy to lay the blame on successive governments for failing to address health as a fundamental right for the Indian people. But the real tragedy is that we, the people of India, have not taken our government to task for this catastrophic failure.","Most of the people who make decisions about global health are in the U.S. and Western Europe. There, the mental health care system is dominated by highly trained, expensive professionals in big hospitals, who often see patients over long periods of time. This simply can't be done in rural Africa or India. Who the hell can afford that kind of care?","I think the government must recognise that the wounds of conflict are even more grievous on the mind than the body, and indeed may even serve to fuel further conflict. Where conflict cannot be avoided, provision of adequate psychosocial services to prevent the adverse mental health consequences should take priority.","No matter where you are, depression responds to the same treatment.","I used to be one of the lead actors of a theatre group called Hetu when I was in medical school. Prithvi Theatre was our stomping ground. I'd got many positive reviews.","In 1993, when I landed in Zimbabwe, there were just 10 psychiatrists in that country of 10 million people. Nine of the 10 were foreigners who spoke no regional language.","I am passionate about swimming, which I try to do at least five times a week.","Children have to be provided a nurturing environment to grow. Sadly, in India we don't have a robust mental health programme for children. There is also a lack of accountability in the public system.","There seems little doubt in my mind that depression, in particular at the severe end of the experience of this condition, is as real a disorder as diabetes is at the severe end of blood glucose levels.","Depression has existed as long as mankind itself, and certainly well before psychiatry, antidepressant medication, or the nation of America itself came into being.","In my mind, depression is, like all non-communicable diseases, a physiologically expressed condition which is profoundly influenced by our social and cultural environments. Depression is a global crisis not only because it is common and universal, but because the vast majority of affected people suffer in silence or receive inappropriate care.","In many parts of the world, chaining of people with mental illnesses is not uncommon, nor is seeing people walking around in clearly an unwell state, half naked, and no one takes any notice of them. It is tragic. There is a basic human right, which is not about just healthcare, but it is about the right to life with dignity, a right to citizenship.","India remains one of the few nations which still focuses entirely on an archaic de-addiction model, administered by the ministry of social justice and empowerment, to address drinking problems, adhering to a centuries-old idea of these problems being a moral disorder rather than a health condition.","Most aid agencies do not even consider proposals to treat mental health problems; those that do think of it as a minor player, overshadowed by the pressing need to save lives by treating physical illness."],"Vikram Rohit Shetty":["I remember a time when I was younger, when if you had to see an actor, you had to go to the theatre and watch a film.","My grandfather made films on God, I make it on the devil, so, I wonder what he would say if he was alive. He'd probably disown me.","I love writing. Given a choice, after directing for all these years, and if given an army of talented directors, I would not direct at all."],"Vikram Seth":["The problem with too beautiful a view is that it's alright for the mulling stage. But for the writing stage, you want to be somewhere without a view, especially if it is very different from what you're writing.","In general, questions are fine; you can always seize upon the parts of them that interest you and concentrate on answering those. And one has to remember when answering questions that asking questions isn't easy either, and for someone who's quite shy to stand up in an audience to speak takes some courage.","Realism hasn't fallen out of favor with most people, who are interested in people's lives rather than gymnastics of style or literary trends. It's a certain kind of academic who undervalues realism, largely because it is not amenable to endless exegesis.","I think if something is worth doing, it's worth doing well. And worth thinking about it as well.","I don't think anyone should be banned. If you don't like a book, set it aside.","I just love music - by no stretch of the imagination am I professionally competent.","If I'm compelled to do something, I don't shy away from it simply because I haven't tackled it before.","I think it's possible to be multi-rooted, rather like a banyan tree, without being deracinated.","I'm actually a very lazy person. Most of the time, I'm happy to sit around and stare. Or watch bad TV soaps. It's quite rare for me to get inspired by anything, but it could be something small. A view of the Serpentine. A snatch of music. Or a little shred of conversation overheard on a bus, such as, 'You also will marry someone of my choice.'","I need my natural laziness to be counteracted by obsession in order to do anything.","The thing about inspiration is that it takes your mind off everything else.","There are plenty of good Indian writers in English, and none of us feel we are carrying the burden of being a poster boy.","I don't think people give Indian society enough credit. We may not like to talk much about things but we do, basically, want to live and let live.","Poetry, I think, intensifies the reader's experience. If it's a humorous facet of the story, poetry makes it more exuberant. If it's a sad facet, poetry can make it more poignant.","Everyone sort of sees his own life and times as being ephemeral. One thinks that everything good or important that happened, happened in the past. But I think that seeing scenes that you are used to, but with the heightening effects of poetry, perhaps makes you value your life and times more than you might otherwise do.","My main motivation is not to get bored. I'm just hoping I get a vaguely maverick reputation.","I spent many years of my life as an economist and demographer. I was finally distracted by writing my novels and poetry. I'm enormously happy that was the case. I feel that with writing I have found my metier.","Revision has its own peculiar pleasures and its own peculiar frustrations. The ground rules are already established; the characters already exist. You don't have to bring the characters to life, but you do have to make them more convincing.","After 'A Suitable Boy,' I didn't write anything, not even a short story. I thought to myself: 'I ought to start writing.' But I can never force myself to write.","If somebody writes clearly, you can pretty much tell immediately if something is shallow or deep, whereas if they write with all this duckweed on the surface, you can't tell if the stream is one inch deep or a hundred fathoms.","I think goodness is about how person behaves to person, and also person to world, to nature.","Of course, I have to consider that I've written a lot of prose, but I do in my heart think of myself as being originally, and still primarily, a poet.","Dear though the reader might be, I'd be silly to cater to what the reader wanted.","The fact is that at different stages of your life, and under the influence of different inspirations, you write different things. The point is not necessarily to find your voice, which grinds out the same sort of thing again and again, but to find a vehicle for people who are far more important than the author: the characters.","I often feel newspapers are just filling up space. Of course, I also know people who write really long books.","The trick to being a novelist is to act like an iceberg. Make it seem as if you're displaying only one-tenth of what you know, and the other nine-tenths isn't visible and never mind if that part is pure styrofoam!","I am careful about fiction. A novel is not a tract or an essay. If I want to write about land reforms, or Hindu-Muslim relations, or position of women, I can do it as it affects my characters as in 'A Suitable Boy.' I could only write about issues specifically through essays. But I'll do that only if I have something worthwhile to say.","In spite of all temptations of belonging to many nations, I've remained an Indian.","You have to learn a few things, which you do along the way, but basically, poetry is a matter of the ear. Iambic pentameters or what constitutes a stanza comes naturally - your ears will know.","I don't read as much as people may expect. In fact, sometimes I feel that I should probably read more, but then I do believe that one of the big problems of our times is that there's too much reading and not enough thinking.","Too many trees are killed to print the words of people who may not have all that much to say, and authors and journalists are equally culpable in this regard.","I tend to follow a scattershot approach to reading a lot of very diverse subjects interest me, and I'm quite happy to read stuff on any of them.","If you were to ask me to pick my favourite author, well, there are so many of them, I'd really just have to say the first names that came to mind, and I'm sure that I'll later think 'Oh, I should have mentioned that one.'","I am certainly not allergic to causes - particularly on subjects such as religious intolerance.","Of course, a law that is selectively used is in one aspect even worse than a law that is generally used because it puts a lot of power in individuals' hands and makes government a rule, not of laws, but of people.","When I realised that I had feelings for men as well as women, at first I was worried and frightened, and there was a certain amount of 'Who am I? Am I a criminal?' and so on. It took me a long time to come to terms with myself. Those were painful years - painful then and painful to look back on.","I'm not sure anyone can understand a whole life, even their own.","I love speculating about solutions to problems in mathematics. I have no interest whatever in sudoku. But I do look at chess and bridge problems in newspapers. I find that relaxing.","I rarely listen to music while writing. If I don't like it, it bothers me, and if I like it, it absorbs me so much I can't write.","As for what I listen to after writing, it could be anything - but I've noticed that if the current book contains music from one tradition, it is music from another tradition that most relaxes me.","On the whole, I don't like reading long books. I'm not a fan of 'Ulysses.' And I haven't quite finished 'War and Peace.'","I want my books to sell, to be read. I'm not interested in being obscure.","I have a reputation for being hermitlike. I'm not. I'm just obsessed with my work.","Fiction basically is a form of gossip where you want to enter other people's lives, the lives of people you don't know, and you want to know what's going to happen to them.","The point really is that a writer tends to write a book that he or she tends to write. It's as simple as that. Of course, it's important to make a living and all that, but the main impulse as far as I'm concerned - and I'm sure as other writers are concerned - is to tell a story that I feel impelled by.","So many Indian novels, quite unfairly, do not get the prominence they should because they have been written in a language other than English.","Why do writers, say, give up a job in economics and decide to write poetry? Or, why do they give up a job in a bank and decide to paint, like Krishan Khanna? They want to convey something.","Basically, my mother couldn't hold a tune and when I was a baby, a rather tactless baby, I would ask her not to sing... you can't get to sleep if someone is singing off key nearby.","Good music is good music, but it has to be good.","In a painting, you can't make out whether the artist painted the left eye before the right eye. In Chinese calligraphy, you can see the progression of the artist's stroke.","I simply seem to drift. But I sort of allow the drift, because it has a kind of check - it forces me to work harder at what I'm interested in.","Do not write if there is no tremendous urge to do so. At the heart, there must be an inspiration or muse or one of those old-fashioned things. Else, why bore yourself, destroy other people's interest and kill trees?","I don't pick and choose subjects or settings; they pick and choose me.","You get your inspiration - suggestions - wherever you have to, even from your mother.","I certainly think it's very important that writers as citizens - not necessarily as writers, but just as ordinary citizens - should talk about things that matter to them.","You can talk good ideas out of existence.","Those books of mine that are remunerative - I'm not talking about poetry here - take years to write, and I am never sure they'll be successful. So writing is a risk in more senses than one.","It is exciting to write about the present once one gets beyond the trivia of the moment. As a time to live in, as a time to think about, the present is intriguing.","I don't want to talk too much about the nitty-gritty of writing. It's rather like a pressure cooker with a certain amount of pressure in it - the more you let out, the less you cook.","I know from an editor's point of view or a publisher's point of view it's easier to slot me into a particular niche. But I know that I'd be bored unless I wrote a book that in some senses was a challenge.","You know, I can imagine not writing a novel and writing poetry only."],"Viktor E. Frankl":["Challenging the meaning of life is the truest expression of the state of being human.","When we are no longer able to change a situation - we are challenged to change ourselves.","Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.","Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms - to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.","For the meaning of life differs from man to man, from day to day and from hour to hour. What matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person's life at a given moment.","Life can be pulled by goals just as surely as it can be pushed by drives.","Everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life; everyone must carry out a concrete assignment that demands fulfillment. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated, thus, everyone's task is unique as his specific opportunity to implement it.","Since Auschwitz, we know what man is capable of. And since Hiroshima, we know what is at stake.","If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death, human life cannot be complete.","In a position of utter desolation, when man cannot express himself in positive action, when his only achievement may consist in enduring his sufferings in the right way - an honorable way - in such a position man can, through loving contemplation of the image he carries of his beloved, achieve fulfillment.","The last of human freedoms - the ability to chose one's attitude in a given set of circumstances.","The more one forgets himself - by giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love - the more human he is.","Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it.","When I was taken to the concentration camp of Auschwitz, a manuscript of mine ready for publication was confiscated. Certainly, my deep desire to write this manuscript anew helped me to survive the rigors of the camps I was in.","When we are no longer able to change a situation - just think of an incurable disease such as an inoperable cancer - we are challenged to change ourselves.","There is nothing in the world, I venture to say, that would so effectively help one to survive even the worst conditions as the knowledge that there is a meaning in one's life.","We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread.","Religion is the search for ultimate meaning.","Fear may come true that which one is afraid of.","Each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible.","I recommend that the Statue of Liberty be supplemented by a Statue of Responsibility on the west coast.","Live as if you were living a second time, and as though you had acted wrongly the first time.","A man who becomes conscious of the responsibility he bears toward a human being who affectionately waits for him, or to an unfinished work, will never be able to throw away his life. He knows the 'why' for his existence, and will be able to bear almost any 'how.'","Man is that being who invented the gas chambers of Auschwitz; however, he is also that being who entered those chambers upright, with the Lord's Prayer or the Shema Yisrael on his lips.","Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather he must recognize that it is he who is asked.","A thought transfixed me: for the first time in my life, I saw the truth as it is set into song by so many poets, proclaimed as the final wisdom by so many thinkers. The truth - that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire.","A human being is a deciding being.","To the European, it is a characteristic of the American culture that, again and again, one is commanded and ordered to 'be happy.' But happiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue. One must have a reason to 'be happy.'","No one can become fully aware of the very essence of another human being unless he loves him.","Ever more people today have the means to live, but no meaning to live for.","A painter tries to convey to us a picture of the world as he sees it; an ophthalmologist tries to enable us to see the world as it really is. The logotherapist's role consists of widening and broadening the visual field of the patient so that the whole spectrum of potential meaning becomes conscious and visible to him.","If you call 'religious' a man who believes in what I call a Supermeaning, a meaning so comprehensive that you can no longer grasp it, get hold of it in rational intellectual terminology, then one should feel free to call me religious, really.","Being human always points, and is directed, to something or someone, other than oneself - be it a meaning to fulfill or another human being to encounter.","Logotherapy sees the human patient in all his humanness. I step up to the core of the patient's being. And that is a being in search of meaning, a being that is transcending himself, a being capable of acting in love for others.","Even a genius cannot completely resist his Zeitgeist, the spirit of his time.","Faith is trust in ultimate meaning."],"Viktor Korchnoi":["The human element, the human flaw and the human nobility - those are the reasons that chess matches are won or lost.","Every time I win a tournament I have to think that there is something wrong with modern chess.","I don't study; I create."],"Viktor Orban":["Protecting a border is not a nice thing. It is not a matter of aesthetics; it cannot be done with flowers and teddy bears.","I think that with Donald Trump, the United States will have a president who is not ideologically limited; that is, he is an open person, much more interested in success, efficiency, and results than political theories.","We should involve the whole world in the handling of this refugee crisis.","Hungary does not need a single migrant for the economy to work or the population to sustain itself or for the country to have a future.","Hungary is against the export of democracy and opposes migration.","All things considered, defending our borders by building a fence to keep out people is a necessity. There is no more humane alternative when it comes to protecting ourselves. We must act humanely, within the law, while honoring transparency, but with firm resolve.","A European army must protect the continent from two sides, from the east and from the south, in terms of protecting against terrorism and migration.","We would like to preserve Europe for Europeans.","There is a clear link between illegal migrants coming to Europe and the spread of terrorism.","What sort of Europe do we want to have? Parallel societies? Muslim communities living together with the Christian community?","As the world undergoes a major transformation, it's the time of significant opportunity and also threat.","My lesson from history is that if there is a strong moderate centrist party which can lead the country, there is no room for extremists from the right or left.","Turkey is a safe country. Stay there.","An important notion in Indian political thought that is of great value to Hungary is the idea of peaceful development.","When a crowd rushes into your house without declaring its intention, it is, by definition, an invasion.","The best migrant is the migrant who does not come.","We will not import crime, terrorism, homophobia, and a brand of anti-Semitism that sets synagogues ablaze.","In Hungary, if homosexuals would like to live together, they can do so under the civil code. But what we call marriage is exclusively for one man and one woman. We are a Christian country. That's a historical fact.","If Europe does not return to the path of common sense, it will find itself laid low in a battle for its fate.","The strongest institution in the hands of the European Union is the euro.","We must set up large refugee camps outside the E.U. with armed security and financial support provided by the Union.","We must first and foremost defend Hungary's independence and sovereignty, and, if needed, we must regain it.","If you want to decide the question of migration without asking your citizens against the will of the people, you are fighting a losing battle.","We need to fight to prove to people that it is possible to form an E.U. migration policy that is in line with the Hungarian national interest.","We would like to make it quite clear that we are not migrants into the U.K. But we are the citizens of a state that belongs to the European Union who can take jobs anywhere freely within the European Union.","Europe and European identity is rooted in Christianity.","We have to abandon liberal methods and principles of organizing a society.","Xenophobia is dangerous, but patriotism is a good thing.","I don't think that our European Union membership precludes us from building an illiberal new state based on national foundations.","The main threat to the future of Europe is not those who want to come here to live but our own political, economic, and intellectual elites bent on transforming Europe against the clear will of the European people.","We think that without cooperation with the Russians, we cannot achieve our goals.","If your budget is in good shape and you are not indebted too much, you can do what the U.S. did at the beginning of the '30s - building railways, etc., but when you don't have that, you must be far more cautious.","When everything is going well, the role of the state in the economy should be limited. When we are in a crisis, it's different.","Hungarian communists were the most talented. They convinced everybody that reforming the communist party was better than making a new party.","Concerning Poland, I can only say that the peoples of Central Europe and Hungary are a community in fate, to the death. Many of us would spill our blood for Poland any time. And vice versa: in an emergency, many Polish people would give his life to protect Hungarians. This has happened more than once over the course of history.","Liberal democratic states can't remain globally competitive.","On the taxing of banks, we have to find the level at which they squeal but still pay and open up the next day.","Selecting Budapest would not only be a new city and country for the Olympic Games, but put the region on the map. We want to organise the first Central Eastern Europe Olympics.","What is the basic principle of democracy? In the end, it is loyalty to the nation. We Central Europeans know from historical experience that sooner or later, we will lose our freedom if we do not represent the interests of our citizens.","We cannot let Brussels put itself above the law.","We'd accept Germany either allowing all migrants in or not allowing any in. But whatever Germany decides should only apply to Germany.","Extremism is always potentially dangerous, but in Hungary's political reality, Jobbik and the other far-right parties have no chance of having a major influence.","The Hungarians, by nature, are not extreme. They become more extreme only when they are forced to fight for their freedom, as was in the case in the uprising against the communists in 1956 or the revolution against the Austrian Empire. They will not turn extreme in the name of despotism.","Irresponsibility is the mark of every European politician who holds out the promise of a better life to immigrants and encourages them to leave everything behind and risk their lives in setting out for Europe.","Do you agree that the European Union should be able to prescribe the mandatory settlement of non-Hungarian citizens in Hungary without the consent of parliament?","The death penalty question should be put on the agenda in Hungary.","Hungary was the only Central European country that was not able to create a new constitution after the collapse of the communist regime.","Life starts at conception and must be protected from the first moment.","It would be a sad story to get rid of religious belief, national identity, family, and even sexual identity. That's not freedom.","We interpret our agreement with the IMF - our participation in the IMF's system of cooperation - as a borrowing agreement. The IMF sees it as an economic policy agreement. This is not in our interest.","Hungary will stop at nothing when it comes to protecting its citizens.","Hungary has no raw materials and no major energy sources; we have some agricultural background. So what we produce here in Hungary is the result of our labor and minds, and then we have to sell it to the world. If we are not able to do that, if we are not innovative enough, if we are not modern and open enough, we can't do that.","Movement of people is taking place on an immense scale, and from a European perspective, the number of potential future immigrants seems limitless.","Is it not worrying in itself that European Christianity is now barely able to keep Europe Christian? If we lose sight of this, the idea of Europe could become a minority interest in its own continent.","We have promised to support India in its international aspiration. We have agreed to set up a working group on technology.","We are looking for rebuilding Hungarian defence Industry with India's participation.","We are not communists.","We don't go against the will of the people.","Kadar died as a mass killer, and the Hungarian nation can't forget that.","Fidesz's different air and its own culture must be preserved.","Life is not easy in politics.","Europe can't take in huge masses of foreign people in an unlimited, uncontrolled manner.","Donald Trump has made it clear that he regards Hungary highly.","We do not want to go to the U.K. and take something from them. We do not want to be parasites. We want to work there, and I think that Hungarians are working well.","According to our estimates, the Hungarians working in the U.K. altogether pay more contributions and taxes than the benefits that they get. So we belong to the world of the fair working people.","All the terrorists are basically migrants.","If you allow thousands or millions of unidentified persons into your house, the risk of... terrorism will significantly increase.","We must not stop speaking the truth to the radical parties because voters will follow those who speak the truth, and European politics will grow more radical, which is in nobody's interest.","The Southern borders of Bavaria are being protected by Hungary.","The most important thing is to defend the euro.","The euro must be defended, or uncertainty about the European Union will be widespread.","Europe is a community of half a billion people, more than Russia and the United States combined.","Europe has the technology, the strategic and economic might to defend itself.","The migration wave can be stopped.","We must make it clear that our problem is not in Mecca but in Brussels.","We would be able to deal with Islam if we were allowed to deal with it in the way we think we should.","The obstacle for us is not Islam, but the bureaucrats in Brussels.","I belong to Helmut Kohl's political pupils.","President Erdogan has been my personal friend for a long time.","It is our historical experience, that Hungary can only live in wealth and safety if Berlin, Moscow, and Ankara are on our side and also interested in our success - even if we do not always agree on certain questions.","There are so many problems in the E.U. that several countries are warming up to the idea that after the single currency, a deeper integration could also be created.","To be clear and unequivocal, I can say that Islamisation is constitutionally banned in Hungary.","The point of the future is that anything can happen.","Brussels' stance against Poland is not just... they should give more respect to the Poles.","These activists who support immigrants inadvertently become part of this international human-smuggling network.","The Hungarian people voted for NATO membership. We are active in the joint actions of NATO.","Boxing is a noble sport.","Values are more important than money.","Take seriously the traditions, the Christian roots, and all the values that are the basis of the civilisation of Europe.","Europe can be saved.","The Hungarian interest is that, if necessary, we should make loan agreements with the IMF on a regular basis.","It is not in our interest to sign economic policy agreements with the IMF, as that unnecessarily limits the room to manoeuvre of... the Hungarian government, Hungarian parliament and lawmakers.","We are protecting Europe according to European rules that say borders can be crossed only in certain areas in a controlled way and after registration.","If Europe's outer border is not blocked off, it makes no sense to speak of quotas.","When we have sealed the outer border and thus stopped the illegal migration, we can talk about any solution.","With a successful center-right party such as ours, it is hard for the radical right to find room to operate. This is why they repeatedly attack us in the ugliest manner. They attack us more than they attack the Jewish community or the 'Jewish conspiracy' - which they believe exists. I am one of their main targets.","The foreign policy of the Democrats is bad for Europe and deadly for Hungary. In contrast, the foreign policy of the Republicans and proclaimed by presidential candidate Trump is good for Europe and means life for Hungary.","'I can't get no satisfaction,' in political terms, has haunted Hungarian politics for 20 years.","We must defend what we have achieved so far.","The future or the past - It's very simple: building the future, or a restoration of post-communism.","We can set it as a goal that taxes on labor would be even lower in Hungary... that we will have the cheapest energy in Europe, and that all those who want to work would have a job.","We are convinced that locking Russia out of Europe is not rational.","Whoever thinks... that the European economy can be competitive without economic cooperation with Russia, whoever thinks that energy security can exist in Europe without the energy that comes from Russia, is chasing ghosts.","Hungary needs Russia.","Many people in Hungary acted shamefully during World War II.","Hungary has a moral debt to the Jews that it helped send to death camps thirty years after the First World War.","If somebody takes masses of non-registered immigrants from the Middle East into a country, this also means importing terrorism, criminalism, anti-Semitism, and homophobia.","A country that does not fulfill its tasks in protecting the external borders has to cope with the consequences.","The Democrats' foreign policy is bad for Europe and deadly for Hungary. The migration and foreign policy advocated by the Republican candidate, Mr. Trump, is good for Europe and vital for Hungary.","The leaders of Europe always seem to emerge from the same elite, the same general frame of mind, the same schools, and the same institutions that rear generation after generation of politicians to this day. They take turns implementing the same policies.","If the world sees that we can defend our borders... then no one will try to come to Hungary illegally."],"Viktor Vekselberg":["I like football, but I think this is a very personal matter. I don't see any negatives for some Russian rich man to buy a football club.","My personal opinion is that I'm in the media too much. I'm not a politician, I'm a businessman. I would like to be without any extra visibility.","My parents were ordinary people; we lived in a small apartment.","In Russia, or anywhere, people don't like rich people. Yeah, OK, I have money, but the question is how I use it. It's not easy, believe me; it's not easy."],"Viktor Yanukovych":["I came from a very poor family and my main dream in life was to break out of this poverty.","For me, there are no my people and strangers, no bad people and good people. All people are equal for me.","I have never allowed anti-Russian rhetoric in Ukrainian policy toward such a strategic partner like Russia. This is the first point. I never went against the interests of the Ukrainian state and the Ukrainian people.","We must improve our lives and we will do it together - all of our citizens and myself as president of Ukraine.","The Party of the Regions has won a convincing victory. We are ready to undertake responsibility for forming the Cabinet and we are calling on everyone to join us.","I don't need power at the cost of spilled blood.","I remain committed to a balanced policy, which will protect our national interests both on our eastern border - I mean with Russia - and of course with the European Union.","I think that Yulia Tymoshenko should prepare to resign. She understands that well.","I am sure that the Ukrainian nation deserves a better life. That is why I have voted for good changes and for stability."],"Viktor Yushchenko":["The regime is afraid of the people because it knows that free and fair elections will bring about its end.","The conviction of our Ukrainian nation is embedded in the pages of its history.","Our mothers and fathers want change. They worked all of their lives, but today live in destitution.","There is only one conflict in Ukraine today and it is between the regime and the people.","Ukraine must once again be revered and respected by its citizens as well as the East and the West.","We can and must turn this page if we are friends and are prepared to look one another in the eye.","We want work and we want honest jobs. Our minds and our hands will be our keep!"],"Vilayanur S. Ramachandran":["We are not angels, we are merely sophisticated apes. Yet we feel like angels trapped inside the bodies of beasts, craving transcendence and all the time trying to spread our wings and fly off, and it's really a very odd predicament to be in, if you think about it.","The boundary between neurology and psychiatry is becoming increasingly blurred, and it's only a matter of time before psychiatry becomes just another branch of neurology.","Ask, 'How are we different from the great apes?' We have culture, we have civilisation, and we have language to be celebrated as part of being human.","A culture without mythology is not really a civilisation.","If we knew about the real facts and statistics of mortality, we'd be terrified.","Remember that politics, colonialism, imperialism and war also originate in the human brain.","The minute you succumb to outside pressure, you cease to be creative.","If there is anything about your 'self' of which you can be sure, it is that it is anchored in your own body and yours alone. The person you experience as 'you' is here and now and nowhere else.","When I speak of artistic universals, I am not denying the enormous role played by culture. Obviously culture plays a tremendous role, otherwise you wouldn't have different artistic styles - but it doesn't follow that art is completely idiosyncratic and arbitrary, either, or that there are no universal laws.","Everyone knows that metaphors are important, yet we have no idea why.","You need to have tremendous confidence in your work, even a touch of arrogance, chutzpah. Many very fine researchers lack intellectual daring. It's human nature to want to be cozy, secure. But that can be a cul de sac.","The brain abhors discrepancies.","Our ability to perceive the world around us seems so effortless that we tend to take it for granted.","Lofty questions about the mind are fascinating to ask, philosophers have been asking them for three millennia both in India where I am from and here in the West - but it is only in the brain that we can eventually hope to find the answers.","You can't just take an image and randomly distort it and call it art - although many people in La Jolla where I come from do precisely that.","I was socially isolated as a kid. I had friends, but I wasn't very good at sports and that sort of thing so I became quite comfortable being by myself, exploring. The world was my private playground, and in it, I was supreme. Darwin, Faraday, Huxley and other great scientists were my companions.","If you're a thinking person, the liver is interesting, but nothing is more intriguing than the brain.","My interests span biology, though sometimes I feel like an anachronism, somebody from the Victorian era when there weren't so many boundaries dividing the sciences.","My views as an individual ought not to be confused with my views as a scientist - the minute you try to mingle God and science, you get into trouble. Metaphysics has its place, and science has its place; don't mix the two.","My mother was religious; she was knowledgeable about mythology and scriptures; she could tell the metaphysical nuances and make the story come to life with their deeper significance. The current generation is missing out on this.","The adage that fact is stranger than fiction seems to be especially true for the workings of the brain.","People often ask how I got interested in the brain; my rhetorical answer is: 'How can anyone NOT be interested in it?' Everything you call 'human nature' and consciousness arises from it.","Science is like a love affair with nature; an elusive, tantalising mistress. It has all the turbulence, twists and turns of romantic love, but that's part of the game.","The fact that hype exists doesn't prove that something is not important.","It may well be our brains are wired up to be slightly more optimistic than they should be."],"Vilfredo Pareto":["Give me the fruitful error any time, full of seeds, bursting with its own corrections.

It's laid in a coffin, waiting to be cremated.","I'm only 26 - I don't know anything about life yet. Life is like a puzzle and my pieces are spread all over the world.","That music and the lyrical aspects of Razorblade Romance is so personal to me that, now with me being grown up a bit and meeting new people and doing new things, it makes me look at the same things I was writing about back in the day through a different colored lens.","Love is the funeral of hearts.","I've got asthma. When I was 17 I forgot to take my medication and was taken to a hospital for almost two weeks. After that I've taken better care of my illness.","It's like that with what sort of ideas people outside of the band have of HIM. They all see it through a different lens as well which is beautiful. Hopefully, it makes it an endless topic of conversation.","I didn't have any role models really. My best friend was a dog. My mum and dad saved a dog from the gutter and that dog was my brother before Jesse was born. Sami was his name and he was my role model.","Music's always been really cathartic. It's the best drug for me to get away from the everyday pressures just for a second via a good song.","Art is always criticized and always an outsider gets the blame.","Even at school I studied ethics instead of religion.","We're trying to have the band create something beautiful that hopefully one day, 20 years from now, can be picked up by a kid and hopefully have the same effect that Neil Young had on me, or Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath.","Play as well as you can; that's it, as opposed to creating these odd paranoias, trying to be something you're not.","There's always reasons to make mistakes. Because then you do new mistakes next time. So they're beautiful mistakes.","Women are always beautiful.","Hopefully it will be possible to get all our other albums in American shops one day so if people are interested they can hear it but I'm hoping that people are going to be interested in what we are going to do, not just what we've done.","I have never acted in one and I'm not at all interested to do so either.","I haven't travelled that much before so this is the first time I get to see the big cities of Europe. I've never even been to US.","I like to listen to mellow stuff on the road like Travis, as we are constantly surrounded by rock music on tour and so its nice listening to mellow stuff. Obviously back at home I listen to a lot more rock music.","I love Johnny Cash but I don't love country music that much.","I think if we keep on doing good music and people like us and they buy the magazine because we are in the magazine then they cant basically hate us hopefully.","I'm a collecting maniac and I buy a lot of books and records. I have over thousand cds.","I'm a huge fan of James Dean, that got me started. Nowadays I smoke four packs in a day.","I'm living my dream right now. I get to make music, perform and travel.","I've always been a huge reggae fan.","It's the same with visual arts, you have some really cool, wonderful striking images that make you think and then again you have wonderful striking images that just take you away from the existing world for a second. And I like the latter a bit more.","Los Angeles and New York are the big centers of the music industry worldwide so of course it can be hard for newcomers who don't know what to expect from the music business.","Music for me is an emotional thing and it really does make me happy. It's not a tool for me to get fame or see my face in the papers or anything like that. It's about the fact that I really do enjoy it.","So basically, I think music at its best can be everything. It can be totally stupid and very intellectual and emotional at the same time. I don't think all those things shut each other out.","Some genres I'm not a huge fan of but there are always exceptions that break the rules. There are always a few people doing it in a way weird enough to grab my attention.","Talking about covers, whether visually or sonically, if a particular combination of notes struck a chord in your heart in a way that you want to be a part of it by covering that song, then there's nothing wrong with it.","The guys in Kiss use some make up too so at first it was exiting. I've almost stopped using make-up nowadays.","Unfortunately we just toured the East and West coasts so we didn't run into any rednecks.","We started playing music from an early age and so we wasn't really aware of that side of it, the weird thing is the more successful you get the more free booze and drugs you get, they should be given to the bands who don't have the money.","Well, for us, it's always better not to have too many expectations and to just go with the flow because then it's always a big plus no matter what happens.","Yeah I'm still writing. I've got about 14 tracks now. But we've been on tour so we haven't had time to get back to a rehearsal place.","I haven't been baptised. My dad's not in the church and is not a religious person. My mum is more spiritual - she does Thai-chi and goes to Stonehenge and things like that. I'm proud to be pagan. Finland is not really a religious country. I'm still looking for my god.","When I heard Elvis Presley, then I knew I had to do music. Music is my god, and is the only love that has never left me. It has always been there and is my best friend.","In almost every interview someone asks what does HIM stand for. I can't even remember our latest lie about that. When Hanson was hot, we said it means Hanson Is Murder. The name doesn't have a particular history. His Infernal Majesty was a totally different band. I think HIM derives from some death metal joke.","I love the Ronettes, the 'do-run-run-run' pop stuff. I love the lyrics, having 'blue, blue blue' being repetitive.","I love the song 'Into the Night.' It's Roy Orbison meets David Lynch meets Iggy Pop on amphetamines. It has a punk edge that is not HIM, per se. It is super melodic and super '60s, and that is very new to me and it is a sense of achievement to me.","I hate it when bands do that; they're so proud of their new album, they have to play all of it and a couple of golden oldies."],"Vin Diesel":["It's insecurity that is always chasing you and standing in the way of your dreams.","You know when something feels so good but you're afraid to feel good about it? So you kinda hold back? Everyone says, Congratulations, you must be so happy. And you say something stupid like, I'm just doing what little I can with what little I have.","With age, you get to a place where you don't want to knock people out. You just want to give people a hug.","I'm the most ambitious person you ever met.","It wasn't until I went to college and I got my first motorcycle that I understood the thrill of speed.","My mom used to say that I became a fighter and a scrapper and a tough guy to protect who I am at my core.","I act because it's the one time I'm sure of my identity. There's no doubt. It's on paper.","The video game culture was an important thing to keep alive in the film because we're in a new era right now. The idea that kids can play video games like Grand Theft Auto or any video game is amazing. The video games are one step before a whole other virtual universe.","If you're the type of person who has to fulfill your dreams, you've gotta be resourceful to make sure you can do it. I came out to California when I was 21, thinking my New York credentials would take me all the way. I came back home a year later all dejected and a failure.","A transvestite spends her entire life trying to look as feminine as possible and I have clearly spent mine celebrating my masculinity.","You break her heart, I'll break your neck.","What was bizarre, when I was younger, I never watched TV. I would rather watch a movie 100 times than to watch a TV show, just to find another nuance. I can't tell you how many times I've watched 'On the Waterfront', just to find a flaw so that I can learn and try to improve my thing.","The thing that stood out above and beyond all the experiences was this relationship with the nine-month-old baby. On weekends, I'd be thinking about going back to set on Monday just to see the baby.","I shaved my head about 15 years ago and the first time I shaved it, I started running my hand through my hair and it was very therapeutic.","Film is my hobby, so I will work well through the night to develop films, whatever film I'm doing or dream projects I have.","Well, love motivates me in everything I do.","A day with my kids is the best day.","I've worked out for years. For a long time, it was my only sense of gratification.","Every actor has their own process. For me, I really need to stay in the pocket. So, if I'm on set and I'm in character, I'm not thinking like a producer. If I'm on set and I'm not in character, wardrobe and make-up, and I'm just coming on set for the moments that I'm not shooting, then I'm able to be the producer.","A person in my position has to restrain himself.","If you had asked me back in grade school what I wanted to be when I grew up, I would have said my first choice was an actor, but if I couldn't be that, I'd want to be a superhero.","If you take my performance or my understanding of the role and my appreciation for story and then dress it in CGI, that I guess becomes an action film.","My mother gave me this book called Feature Films at Used Car Prices by a guy named Rick Schmidt. I gotta credit the guy, cuz he gave me the most practical advice. It empowers you.","The whole year I was in LA I got into telemarketing and learned how to make money. Five years later that skill helped me make my first film.","It's hard for me to talk about Dom right now because I am Dom right now. So it's a really strange exercise to try to reflect on something that I am at the moment. But I guarantee you that when I'm done with the movie and you ask me that question, I'll be able to give you something insightful.","When I first did 'The Fast and the Furious', I didn't want there to be a sequel on the first one. I thought, 'Why would you rush to do a sequel - just because your first film is successful?'","I love thinking about the film, the project and committing myself as much as possible.","When your co-stars are 9-month-old babies, you fall in love. You start thinking, When am I going to have my own?","When I got on the set of 'Saving Private Ryan,' I discovered, to my amazement, that Steven Spielberg is a gamer.","I think a few pictures at a time.","I was the oldest of the children in my family. I had to do a lot of diaper-changing and lunch-making. I was taking my little sister to ballet, picking up my brother, sort of being a super-nanny.","I could care less about being an action actor like Stallone or Schwarzenegger.","Filmmaking is such a collaborative piece of art that you can't look to one person - you couldn't look to me, you couldn't say, 'Because Vin's in it, it's this or that...' It's really all of us coming together for that period of time to try and make magic.","I always have issues with trust.","You live these three months in this reality, in this dark reality. You don't want to do those films every year because they're taxing. I started smoking a lot of cigarettes.","It would be flattering to call it a modern Dirty Harry, but I think this film deals more with the loss of his wife than the traditional revenge vigilante films.","I am flattered that they think that many people would enjoy my work. I don't approach any genre a different way than I may approach another one. I treat every role I do like a role worthy of applying whatever kind of tactic, process and talent I have.","I haven't had that many weird encounters with fans, thank God.","I was walking around with the babies so much that when I got to the Sidney Lumet picture, I would be on set in between takes and I'd be rocking back and forth. Just standing like this rocking back and forth, and Sidney would say, Why are you walking like that in between takes?","It was interesting to do a completely fictional piece. You know, Saving Private Ryan was not a fictional piece! So the challenge was: How do you incorporate real emotions? How do you incorporate aspects that people are going to be able to identify with?","We all deal with being unfairly judged.","I'm not really afraid of the dark, except if I'm walking. The thing that scares me the most is the possibility of walking into a wall and busting my lip.","I am definitely a person of color.","My gut feeling about sequels is that they should be premeditated: You should try to write a trilogy first or at least sketch out a trilogy if you have any faith in your film.","I was raised in New York City and raised in the New York City theater world. My father was a theater director and an acting teacher, and it was not uncommon for me to have long discussions about the method and what the various different processes were to finding a character and exploring character and realizing that character.","Obviously, for me, story is first and foremost, even in the face of the attractive idea of having all the cast there, or having a great piece of talent come to it.","The idea of exploring character relations and their development over a decade has to be appealing for any actor who cherishes his craft.","I love what I do.","I love women more than anything.","The only way anyone knows which girl I'm with is if a one-night stand goes on 'Howard Stern.'","You get a timeless cool card in New York.","Deal-making goes on with any job.","My mom insisted on multigrain bread and never allowed soda in the house.","I grew up with all kinds of people.","It's really bizarre because no one knows this, but elephants have killed more animal trainers than any other animal.","I used to feel guilty about owning a console.","You make movies for the people. If critics happen to like them too, well, that's a home run.","I do practice martial arts, more as a recreational thing, but a lot of my friends have been heavyweight champions the in mixed martial arts world.","I don't think a lot of actors talk about it, but there's usually a process where you essentially purge yourself of the character that you played prior to the movie.","I've been auditioning since I was 7 years old.","I was a bouncer for ten years in New York City.","I look formidable.","I have dangerous bones in my body.","I talk too much.","I've directed independent film.","Most of my confidence came from being with ladies, because I certainly wasn't getting any acting jobs.","Women are sacred.","I've turned down twentysomething million dollars for movies.","If it's an amazing role, I'll do anything.","If you think about my filmography, I have never done a movie that a kid could go see, except for 'Iron Giant,' and I'm not even on the screen.","Career diversification ain't a bad thing.","When you go to the movies with your whole family, it's a different experience. For some reason, it's something that you're all doing together and you take away something special in that.","The films that I do are deep, introspective, brooding roles that you're in this heavy headspace all the time.","It's like you have a child and you think, 'Everything that I've done up until this point is insignificant in comparison to being a father.' It's a beautiful, beautiful thing.","I grew up in an artists' community in New York, in a building that was government-subsidised for artists. No one made any money, but they made art for the sake of art.","My mother is the most supportive mother in the world, she's magical.","The one thing I will never do is become pigeonholed.","I am truly multi-racial. I never knew my biological father. I've always had less information than I would have liked to have had. All I know from my mother is that I have connections to many different cultures.","The man who raised me is black. Culturally, he made me who I am. He was a theatre director, so he also guided me artistically.","None of the actor methods ever discussed what it would be like to play a character on film for over a decade, and what it must be like to return to a character and imagine the time off-screen, which is interesting. There's something as an actor that I enjoy about evolving characters.","The thing I'm scared of most is not fulfilling my work. There's so much anxiety around trying to get a movie made that you don't really get to be afraid of anything else.","The reality is that I always envisioned the 'Riddick' franchise as a continuing mythology, so I always imagined that there would be many other films to follow.","I try to create an environment where, when we step onto the set, we're all in character.","If Clark Gable had a Facebook page, there would have been a 'Gone with the Wind 2.'","I don't think a lot of actors talk about it, but there's usually a process where you essentially purge yourself of the character that you played prior to the movie. That's the first thing. You want to do it.","I grew up the son of an acting teacher, so I was kind of introduced to all of these various methods early... I've never been really good at articulating how, what that process is in the way that Stanislavsky could.","I always have issues with trust. I'm a New Yorker... Really, I think trust is something that comes from the gut. And I think you have to - it's probably the worst advice to give people - but I think you gotta trust people from your gut.","The second I walk onto the set and I know that there's a camera and I know that there's a David Twohy behind that camera, there is zero pressure. There is just me jumping into a pool called 'Riddick.' It's the most free I am. It's like channeling something.","I drive a Yukon Flex Fuel, and there's baby seats in the back.","I approach 'Fast & Furious 6' the same way I would approach a Sidney Lumet film. Getting into character's getting into character.","For the 'Riddick' character, I try to get as ruthless as possible, and I want to be a machine."],"Vin Scully":["As long as you live keep smiling because it brightens everybody's day.","Don't let the winds blow your dreams away... or steal your faith in God.","Statistics are used much like a drunk uses a lamppost: for support, not illumination.","The roar of the crowd has always been the sweetest music. It's intoxicating.","It's a wonderful feeling to be a bridge to the past and to unite generations. The sport of baseball does that, and I am just a part of it.","It's a wonderful feeling being a bridge to the past and unite generations.","Be a bobbed cork: When you are pushed down, bob up.","I'm going to sit back, light up, and hope I don't chew the cigarette to pieces.","Good is not good when better is expected.","It's a great time of the year... if you can stand it.","The game is just one long conversation, and I'm anticipating that, and I will say things like 'Did you know that?' or 'You're probably wondering why.' I'm really just conversing rather than just doing play-by-play. I never thought of myself as having a style. I don't use key words. And the best thing I do? I shut up.","I guess my thermometer for my baseball fever is still a goose bump.","Losing feels worse than winning feels good.","If I categorized home runs that I've seen, without a doubt the monumental one is Henry's... but I've seen a lot of classic, great home runs. Gibson's was probably the most theatrical home run I've ever seen.","On radio, you're in your own little world. Every time I'd be doing a possible no-hitter - I think I've done something like 25 no-hitters and a couple of perfect games - I would always put the date on the tape. Not for me, but for the player, so that 25 or 30 years later when he's playing it for his kids or grandkids, you have that date.","I really love baseball. The guys and the game, and I love the challenge of describing things. The only thing I hate - and I know you have to be realistic and pay the bills in this life - is the loneliness on the road.","One of my favorite expressions ever uttered by a player is Roy Campanella's line about how, in order to be a major-league player, you have to have a lot of little boy in you.","Thank you for sneaking your transistor under the pillow as you grew up loving the Tigers. God has a new adventure for me.","You can almost taste the pressure now.","When I was very small, maybe 8 years old, we had a big radio that stood on four legs, and it had a cross piece underneath it, and I used to take a pillow and crawl under the radio.","If I can get a story about a player, I would give you a ship load of numbers, batting averages and all just for that one precious story. That's the kind of thing that I love to do.","Almost all of us growing up have played baseball on some level. It has an inside track with people. It has a unifying effect.","I think when I first started, I tried to make believe I was in the ballpark, sitting next to somebody and just talking. And if you go to a ballgame, and you sit there, you're not going to talk pitches for three hours.","Andre Dawson has a bruised knee and is listed as day-to-day. Aren't we all?","I try to call the play as quickly as I possibly can and then shut up and let the crowd roar because, to me, the crowd is the most wonderful thing in the whole world when it's making noise.","A man really determines himself by what he does.","I don't like to be alone, but I do cherish the moments that I'm alone with a good book.","It's easier to pick off a fast runner than to pick off a lazy runner.","I've told several writers this, and, again, I get back to it, but if you want to make God smile, tell him your plans.","To be honest, I've never been interested in how many games I've done and seen. It doesn't mean anything to anybody. All I know is I'm eternally grateful for having been allowed to work so many games.","That really is my trademark. Day to day, week in, week out. If something happens and the crowd roars, I shut up.","I'm not a military general, a business guru, not a philosopher or author. It's only me.","In all honesty, once you become a professional, number one, you're no longer a fan. I don't root for the Dodgers, really. I just try to do the game as best I can. And the winning and the losing will take care of itself."],"Vince Cable":["Small- and medium-sized businesses need access to a diverse range of finance options, including non-bank lending. These new forms of finance are still small in scale today but they should, over time, bring additional choice and greater competition to the lending market.","I'm now happily remarried to a good cook, which encourages me to be lazy. I like to think that I'm a new man, but perhaps I'm not. I offset it by doing the ironing, though. She has a small farm in the New Forest with a herd of cattle, so she serves up a steak and kidney pie made with her own beef.","I have managed to infuriate the bank bosses; acquire a fatwa from the revolutionary guards of the trades union movement; frighten the 'Daily Telegraph' with a progressive graduate payment; and upset very rich people who are trying to dodge British taxes. I must be doing something right.","And humility in politics means accepting that one party doesn't have all the answers; recognising that working in partnership is progress not treachery.","For wide swaths of training and education there are valuable spillovers which mean that the private sector needs support from the government. That is why I have been so determined to protect and grow apprenticeships and put higher education on a sustainable footing.","The food in the House of Commons is fairly good. The cafe in Portcullis House is really very high quality, and you also have a choice of eating in the more traditional restaurants, the Churchill Room or the Members' Dining Room. I don't often eat in them, though, as I'm usually on the run.","Investment banking has, in recent years, resembled a casino, and the massive scale of gambling losses has dragged down traditional business and retail lending activities as banks try to rebuild their balance sheets. This was one aspect of modern financial liberalisation that had dire consequences.","We do recognise that there are areas where the current financial services market, the banking market, just isn't working for chunks of the British economy.","Our workforce is very co-operative, very flexible, easy to work with and one of the big selling points. The idea that Britain is still back in the labour market of the '70s is utterly bizarre.","When my job was attempting to predict future economic developments for the Shell oil company, I was frequently reminded of an Arabic saying: 'Those who claim to foresee the future are lying, even if by chance they are later proved right.'","The degree of leverage now being reversed is staggering, and the underlying global imbalances - notably between the savers and the spenders - will require long and painful adjustment.","Where there is flagrant abuse of corporate entities we must and will seek to tackle it.","We need a new British business bank with a clean balance sheet and an ability to expand lending rapidly to the manufacturers, exporters and high-growth companies that power our economy. Today I can announce we will have one.","Regulators are a backstop: they don't own banks. The governance at the top of our leading banks has been shown to be lamentably weak. No one at the top of Barclays will take responsibility for systemic abuse.","Now the main areas of higher education that still enjoy considerable financial support from government are subjects like engineering and science and the research ringfence which is the basic minimum to protect Britain's scientific competitiveness.","We have sectors of the economy, aerospace is a good example, where Britain's probably the second country in the world, the automobile sector, where we've done extraordinarily well, an enormous amount of investment over the last couple of years, life sciences is another.","We've been a bit too defensive about the European Union rules. We don't want to become protectionist and nationalist in the way we buy things but we think we could do a lot more to promote British business through procurement.","The real problem at the moment is that the banks - because of their existing culture, which is frankly anti-business, obsession with short-term trading profits, not focusing on the long term - are throttling the recovery of British industry.","Britain is no longer one of the world's price setters. It is painful. It is a challenge to us in government to explain all that, and it is a pity that the political class is not preparing the public for it to understand how massive the problem is.","So I went into government with a clear mind about what the problems were, and what needed to be done.","I am going to confront the old-fashioned negative thinking which says that all government needs to do to generate growth is cut worker and environmental protections, cut taxes on the rich and stroke 'fat cats' until they purr with pleasure. I'm completely repudiating the idea that government has to get out of the way.","Housing associations have fingered the fact that they cannot use their assets as liquidity due to Bank of England rules unlike their continental equivalents. This has emerged to be one of the main bottlenecks to getting investment going in the U.K. It is a Bank of England issue.","The worship of youth has diminished - perhaps generally - in recent years.","I've always been comfortable working with women and I've had two happy marriages. Draw what conclusions you like from that.","I am a bit of a lefty on some issues.","I clearly believe a lot more than some of my coalition colleagues - Tories - in redistribution and using the tax system for that purpose. I also believe in the government having an active role in the economy, which is having an industrial strategy. I'm not a believer in laissez-faire.","Well, as I said, you know the issue of Greek debt, they've grasped the principle of debt reduction. I think most people would argue that probably more needs to be done on that front, and they've just begun to take the first steps to accepting that there's going to have to be much closer economic integration in Europe.","I think what is happening is I think first of all there is confidence in the U.K. economy. We're in a German rather than a Greek position in international financial markets, which is very positive and keeps our debt service costs down, and we're also beginning to see real evidence of rebalancing.","We've got to get back on track to working with them. Because if I and my colleagues are going to continue to attract inward investment from overseas - you know particularly from the big Asian countries - they see Britain as a gateway to Europe. They don't want any doubts cast upon that.","I don't feel comfortable with luxury, and I try to stay fairly normal.","According to the papers, I'm miserable, alienated, and on the brink of resignation. But that's simply not where I am.","No, and in fact I get a bit frustrated, because I'm actually quite good at one-liners, and I've had hundreds of them over the years, and they sink without trace, and I get very frustrated. Every party conference I really work on the speeches, and I always have two or three things I'm quite proud of, and no one ever remembers them.","You can't win with some people. If you're not in government, you're criticised for being not serious. If you are in government, you're criticised for wanting power. That's the Labour party's line of attack, and it's a bit ridiculous.","There was, of course, a global financial crisis. But our Labour predecessors left Britain exceptionally vulnerable and damaged: more personal debt than any other major economy; a dangerously inflated property bubble; and a bloated banking sector behaving as masters, not the servants of the people.","On banks, I make no apology for attacking spivs and gamblers who did more harm to the British economy than Bob Crow could achieve in his wildest Trotskyite fantasies, while paying themselves outrageous bonuses underwritten by the taxpayer. There is much public anger about banks and it is well deserved.","In my job I meet many outstanding, world class, British based companies. But we need more companies and more jobs in the companies we have.","The economy has become seriously unbalanced. Its growth has not been driven by investment or by overcoming Britain's long-standing weaknesses in investment and productivity, particularly skills. Instead, there has been a binge of debt-financed consumer spending.","I fear that the rising personal bankruptcies and repossessions are the first signs of bigger problems to come and personal debt - Gordon Brown's legacy to millions of Britain's families - will hang like a millstone around the neck of the British people for years to come.","Billions of taxpayers' money has been wasted in bad deals. The London Underground modernisation, personally negotiated by one of Gordon Brown's team, was a disaster, as the National Audit Office has confirmed.","When Gordon Brown becomes prime minister, the balance sheet that reflects his economic stewardship could look very sickly indeed. He could become Labour's biggest liability, not its most marketable asset.","Many of our problems are home-grown. Gordon Brown regularly advised the rest of the world to follow his British model of growth. But the model was flawed. It led to the highest level of household debt in relation to income in the world.","Banks operate like a man who either wears his trousers round his chest, stifling breathing, as now, or round his ankles, exposing his assets. We want their trousers tied round their middle: steady lending growth; particularly to productive British business, especially small scale enterprise.","My job is to support businesses, that means promoting British commerce in the big emerging markets that have been neglected in the past. It means keeping Britain open to inward investors, trade and skilled workers. It means cutting red tape which is suffocating growing companies which create jobs.","When I was a child we were sufficiently well off for me to be a picky eater and I still cannot eat vegetables cooked in the traditional British manner.","My late wife Olympia was Goan and I've been to India many times. I love the food there. We used to do our shopping in Southall, where you can find cheap but wonderful fruit like mangoes, vegetables and spices. I didn't do much of the cooking, as Olympia did a lot - I was the under-chef and did some of the chopping.","I made friends with a boy who was a communist when I was 13 and that broadened my political views, but it also brought me into conflict with my father who was very Right-wing.","My college, Fitzwilliam, was pretty good but unfashionable and I lived in digs so I was not part of the cloistered 'old college' environment, which frankly was a bit intimidating. But I worked hard and settled in by exploring politics and girls.","I know it sounds trite but I wanted to make a difference. Political debates with my father had been fraught because he was uncompromising and explosive but if he taught me one thing it was to air my views.","My time at Shell was a most valuable experience because it taught me to look at the world in a long-term way. Shell takes a 20-year view on events and plans for different scenarios. It makes you see the world as a kind of large matrix."],"Vince Carter":["Everybody is different. Everybody has different styles. Just do it the best way you know how.","I don't want or need to gain respect with what I do off the court. I want respect for what I do on the court.","I play some fighting games, but mostly I just play sports.","My first dunk was actually in sixth grade.","I don't care how I got here. In the books, when you look at it 10 or 20 years from now, it's not going say how he got here, it's going to say he's here and he represented the team.","I think people are going to like my new shoes. I like them. I had a lot of success with the one last year, but this year's shoe is going to be a little different, but at the same time it's going to be a little spin-off on last year's shoe.","There's not a thing that any of you guys can say bad about me that would hurt my feelings... I'm not coming at you, what I'm saying is that, I'm willing to take that heat for my team, if we're playing well or if we're not playing well.","I just think people should be able to express themselves."],"Vince Clarke":["I'm actually doing a show. from my shed. on the internet. but it won't be music or anything, it's more to do with drinking and smoking. it's an art piece.","I started writing songs at age 15.","I'm a lover of songs.","Collaboration is no longer painful - or precious.","When I was 20, I thought anyone in the music business over 25 is past it. Then at 30, you think anyone still doing it at 35 is ridiculous. Suddenly, you find yourself at 48 and still doing it, so I don't know what to say, really.","When we start to write for a new record, we never really know what we're doing. We don't come into the room with a set of ideas, but miraculously, a song comes out of it.","I used to do all my programming on a BBC computer. It was limited to 16 tracks, and you used the keyboard, not a mouse, to input, but I was using it so long, I got quite fast at it.","With a track like 'White Christmas,' everybody has done that song in every format you can imagine, so I just looked at the chords at that particular song and what chords would make it work. That's kind of quite a sad song, and I had this idea of someone singing it in the subway, someone who is homeless, old and sad.","I went on iTunes and looked at versions of Christmas songs. Everyone has done them!"],"Vince Flynn":["There's a lot more to publishing a book than writing it and slapping a cover on it.","I just look at what's going on in the world.","I'm a bit of a Libertarian.","My doctors warned me repeatedly that if you don't stay positive, you don't do well.","It's what every writer needs: a daybed.","I'm a big believer in free enterprise. If people want to try it, then go for it.","I have been blessed to have the same editor and work for a great publishing house.","I think the more avenues that open up when people want to publish, the better. Some of the authors that want to jump ship from the traditional houses and go on their own, you know what? Good luck. It's going to be a lot tougher than you think.","No matter how bad you think you have it, there's always - always somebody who's got it way, way worse.","A major theme in all my books is that the CIA is not only the first line of defense but they should also be the first line of offense.","One of the most talented writers out there is Brian Haig.","Anybody who knew me growing up calls me Vinny.","When I give a lot of speeches, they're always on the fly. I mean, I know what I'm going to say roughly, but I do not - will not read.","I have such bad memories, sitting in the back of a classroom, being told, you know, everybody is going to read a paragraph, and skipping ahead to my paragraph and being mortified and trying to read it enough times so that I wouldn't stutter and stammer, getting called on, even in high school.","It's this upside-down world that we live in where we afford political correctness to the most intolerant group of individuals on the planet.","And when I go around and talk to schools, what I tell the kids are, first of all, you have to accept each other's differences. Some of you are going to be a crappy football player, some of you are going to be a great mathematician. Whatever it is, accept each other's differences and help prop each other up.","A good football team plays offense and defense. You have to be aggressive and disrupt."],"Vince Gill":["Success is always temporary. When all is said and one, the only thing you'll have left is your character.","Yes, the companionship is amazing. You know, you can get that physical attraction that happens is great, but then there's an awful lot of time and the rest of the day that you have to fill.","I can sit and analyze everything and beat myself up and say you don't quite sing as good as you used to, you're writing better songs maybe than you used to, but to me it's just the journey.","When all is said and done the only thing you'll have left is your character.","The real beauty of it - key to my life was playing key chords on a banjo. For somebody else it may be a golf club that mom and dad put in their hands or a baseball or ballet lessons. Real gift to give to me and put it in writing.","And from my place, and from the time that I went through my divorce, I also had my father pass away in the middle of all that. And it kind of made everything else just kind of like the back burner, you know.","But you know the thing that I thing oftentimes gets ignored and neglected is there was 10 or 12 years of life before I met Amy and before she met me, where you know, whatever happened was probably going to happen some day.","I am not struggling. What I do, it is what I do.","I am responsible for me. I can kind of take care of what I need to do and should do what I like to do.","I do not like being famous. I like being normal.","I formally proposed. I'm a good Southern gentleman.","I had just lost my dad and I remembered all the songs we used to go and hear at concerts, and the records around the house and sometimes we'd play together.","I made records in the past that are as traditional as any other country records that have been made, but at the same time the records have a contemporary slant on it too.","I mean, look at her. Any idiot, you know, would quite taken with Amy.","I've always been more drawn to being normal than being famous.","It is easy to react if everything is going great.","It is not fun singing about losing somebody like that, but at the same time it was easy to write because the memories were so real and vivid and so much a part of who I am.","It is not that I don't like contemporary country music because I do. I love it. I have recorded a lot and have had great success recording records that have not been very traditional country records.","It really does take a lot of time to make records, to be in the studio and do all that stuff.","My last two records that I made were both quite pointed in one direction and I think I do my best stuff when it's all over the map, when there's a couple traditional things, a couple pretty rocking things.","So I didn't have anything to do with picking the songs, but I got to musically take them in places I thought might be interesting, so it was a real neat collaboration among the three of us.","The funny thing is, people's perceptions of what a song is about is usually wrong a majority of the time. But they're still going to read what they want to into it.","The real amazing thing about all of this is I think I've maintained the mentality of a musician throughout it all, which I'm proudest of. And I'm still playing on people's records and singing on people's records.","This is just strictly me wanting to make a record that is the real deal. It is all the stuff that I have learned and know that I remember. It's what I perceive as country music is about.","This record for the first time - feels like a record that really represents my whole entire life and instead of just a period of my life. And it is really kind of eye opening and it makes me feel really good to hear this record and hear all the years.","Well I think in all the thirty years I've been doing this now and being gone from home and all that stuff it's really, it's not about what I've achieved and if I've become a better player, or played better ten years ago than I do today.","Well, more than me saying to the rest of the country music industry there is not enough traditional country music - that is not necessarily the statement in truth. I think more so that I, me, missed it more than anything else.","Whether it is successful or not is not the exercise for me. It is not up to me. It is out of my hands now. I am not going to in two years have hindsight and say I made a big mistake.","With The Key, it was, I had gone through a divorce and losing my father, and just kinda really reminiscing about how much I loved the traditional side of country music, so I made a record that was really traditional from start to finish.","You learn a whole lot more about a person if they have bad breaks and all those kind of things."],"Vince Gilligan":["The thing that intrigued me about 'Breaking Bad' from day one was the idea of taking a character and transforming him.","The older I get, the more nervous and anxiety-ridden I get. I don't know how to fix that.","'SpongeBob SquarePants' is a great show, and it centers on a character that is courageously nice. Why is SpongeBob interesting? It's because he has passion. He has a passion for chasing jellyfish.","There are two ways of knowing if something ends badly: If you're honest with yourself, you just kind of know it. And then there's other people's reaction to it.","People want what they want, for as long as they want it, then tastes change and something else works.","You don't make a movie by yourself; you certainly don't make a TV show by yourself. You invest people in their work. You make people feel comfortable in their jobs; you keep people talking.","There's nothing more powerful to a showrunner than a truly invested writer.","If you look closely at 'Breaking Bad' and any given episode of 'The X Files,' you will realise the structure is exactly the same."],"Vince Lombardi":["The price of success is hard work, dedication to the job at hand, and the determination that whether we win or lose, we have applied the best of ourselves to the task at hand.","Perfection is not attainable, but if we chase perfection we can catch excellence.","Winners never quit and quitters never win.","Individual commitment to a group effort - that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work.","The achievements of an organization are the results of the combined effort of each individual.","Practice does not make perfect. Only perfect practice makes perfect.","Football is like life - it requires perseverance, self-denial, hard work, sacrifice, dedication and respect for authority.","The measure of who we are is what we do with what we have.","The greatest accomplishment is not in never falling, but in rising again after you fall.","I firmly believe that any man's finest hour, the greatest fulfillment of all that he holds dear, is that moment when he has worked his heart out in a good cause and lies exhausted on the field of battle - victorious.","Winning is habit. Unfortunately, so is losing.","People who work together will win, whether it be against complex football defenses, or the problems of modern society.","Football is a great deal like life in that it teaches that work, sacrifice, perseverance, competitive drive, selflessness and respect for authority is the price that each and every one of us must pay to achieve any goal that is worthwhile.","It's not whether you get knocked down, it's whether you get up.","The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary.","The quality of a person's life is in direct proportion to their commitment to excellence, regardless of their chosen field of endeavor.","A school without football is in danger of deteriorating into a medieval study hall.","We would accomplish many more things if we did not think of them as impossible.","Winning is not a sometime thing; it's an all the time thing. You don't win once in a while... you don't do things right once in a while... you do them right all the time. Winning is habit.","Show me a good loser, and I'll show you a loser.","The difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength, not a lack of knowledge, but rather a lack of will.","Success demands singleness of purpose.","Teamwork is what the Green Bay Packers were all about. They didn't do it for individual glory. They did it because they loved one another.","Mental toughness is spartanism with qualities of sacrifice, self-denial, dedication. It is fearlessness, and it is love.","Confidence is contagious. So is lack of confidence.","Winning isn't everything, it's the only thing.","The harder you work, the harder it is to surrender.","Leaders are made, they are not born. They are made by hard effort, which is the price which all of us must pay to achieve any goal that is worthwhile.","The real glory is being knocked to your knees and then coming back. That's real glory. That's the essence of it.","Some of us will do our jobs well and some will not, but we will be judged by only one thing-the result.","If it doesn't matter who wins or loses, then why do they keep score?","You don't do things right once in a while. You do things right all the time.","Fatigue makes cowards of us all.","It's easy to have faith in yourself and have discipline when you're a winner, when you're number one. What you got to have is faith and discipline when you're not a winner.","I have finished second twice in my time at Green Bay, and I don't ever want to finish second again. There is a second place bowl game, but it is a game for losers played by losers. It is and always has been an American zeal to be first in anything we do, and to win, and to win, and to win.","We run to win, not just to be in the race.","Some guys play with their heads. That's okay. You've got to be smart to be number one in any business. But more importantly, you've got to play with your heart, with every fiber of your body.","If you're lucky enough to find a guy with a lot of head and a lot of heart, he's never going to come off the field second.","Once you agree upon the price you and your family must pay for success, it enables you to ignore the minor hurts, the opponent's pressure, and the temporary failures.","Why did I choose Washington among offers from other cities? Because it is the capital of the world.","They'd better be physically tough when they start pulling on their football pants.","We didn't lose the game; we just ran out of time.","Once you learn to quit, it becomes a habit.","If you aren't fired with enthusiasm, you will be fired with enthusiasm.","The difference between men is in energy, in the strong will, in the settled purpose and in the invincible determination.","Character is just another word for having a perfectly disciplined and educated will. A person can make his own character by blending these elements with an intense desire to achieve excellence. Everyone is different in what I will call magnitude, but the capacity to achieve character is still the same.","Unless a man believes in himself and makes a total commitment to his career and puts everything he has into it - his mind, his body, his heart - what's life worth to him?","There is no room for second place. There is only one place in my game and that is first place. I have finished second twice in my time at Green Bay and I never want to finish second again.","Every time a football player goes to ply his trade, he's got to play from the ground up - from the soles of his feet right up to his head. Every inch of him has to play.","If you can accept losing, you can't win.","There is something good in men that really yearn for discipline.","Coaches who can outline plays on a black board are a dime a dozen. The ones who win get inside their player and motivate.","The will to win is the only thing.","Go back through football, and you will see that the team with the best defense wins.","Battles are won in the hearts of men.","The leader can never close the gap between himself and the group. If he does, he is no longer what he must be. He must walk a tightrope between the consent he must win and the control he must exert.","If you can shrug off a loss, you can't be a winner.","At many a moment on many a day, I am convinced that pro football must be a game for madmen, and I must be one of them.","Some people try to find things in this game that don't exist but football is only two things - blocking and tackling.","I don't think there's a punch-line scheduled, is there?","I'm not afraid to die - it's just that I had so much left to do in this world.","A disciplined person is one who follows the will of the one who gives the orders.","I'll put the Packers' best players on defense. It's best for a team and good for its morale.","I've never been with a losing team in my life, and I don't think I'll start now.","Nobody wants to give up good players."],"Vince McMahon":["The biggest thrill in the world is entertaining the public, there is no bigger thrill than that.","I guess maybe another gift I have is a great work ethic.","I'm not afraid of failing. I don't like to fail. I hate to fail. But I'm not afraid of it.","Sometimes you have to take a half step back to take two forward.","From a person standpoint, the old expression of what doesn't kill you makes you stronger is somewhat true.","We're going to be treated very poorly, I think that goes with the territory, and you have to get over it, get beyond it and know who you are among your peers and especially among your family when you look in the mirror.","But because our organization has grown so much and in so many different ways, the delegation process places responsibility and authority on the shoulders of people you can watch grow and watch the way they treat others.","I have to do something with my mind, or I'll get in trouble.","I'm not too good at lying still in the sun.","So, I get a kick out of working with the media.","So we're living by that sword, and we're going to cut every now and then from it's backlash.","I believe that given the audience attention level, we could do an even more compelling 90 minutes.","That crossover of whether it's entertainment or news is the biggest crock of b.s. in television today, because it's all entertainment.","I'm excited about it, thrilled with the success thus far.","The Rock will always come back to us.","It's difficult to do that internally, because you're flying five, six hours.","In Europe we could do it, if we fly as soon as the event is over.","The key, of course, is to stay away from the losing years.","As far as sustaining our popularity, I believe we can.","We do have our finger on the pulse of the marketplace, if for no other reasons than having all these live events and listening to our audience all the time.","I think there are certain business matters which we must now conduct differently than we used to.","So no, I don't think we've lost our edge at all.","When I'm on vacation here in the States, I can do all kinds of stuff; I can train and keep busy.","I would dare say that most anyone in public life, if they stay in public long enough, is not treated fairly.","I think that the Internet - and I do love the free flow of ideas on the 'Net - is like the wild west of the information world.","One of the problems with the Internet is that a lot of times it is inaccurate.","The standards are being lowered, not just on the Internet, but in all of news and media.","We love our fans, so there's nothing we wouldn't do for them, and we go directly to t hem.","In America it's live by the sword of freedom of expression and be will to die by it as well.","I understand the common man because I understand me in that regard at least.","I'm a real common sense guy who caught a lot of good breaks and who has been very, very fortunate.","I don't know what drives me, I don't have a clue, but I'm driven more today than I ever have been."],"Vince Neil":["With technology now, you can go in and sing a song, and for $100,000, you will sound flawless.","I lost my faith in God when I lost my daughter to Cancer, the beast. I begged, I cried, I offered my life for hers, and day by day, I watched that beautiful little Angel slip off. So, excuse me for not taking my seat next to you on Sunday in Church, I feel too cheated to worship.","I think the world is ready for some rock 'n' roll. Some real time guys that play their own instruments, write their own songs, and sing the music and have a good time doing it.","I don't even listen to music when I'm off tour.","Everybody has forgotten about showmanship. People don't look like rock stars any more. They just look like regular dudes off the street.","I appreciate the 'Surreal Life.' I had a really positive experience on that show, and with those people. I found some love in my heart for religion again, and had the support of a new family of friends. I wouldn't have had the pleasure of meeting those people, if we were not all placed in that fishbowl.","Man, I have had so much plastic surgery, I don't even recognize myself, sometimes. If I catch a glimpse in a window or something, I think it is someone else.","I guess I am just not the marrying type. I have given it a few chances, and it just goes haywire after a month or two. I am on wife number five right now, maybe five's a charm?"],"Vince Staples":["Circumstances dictate your set of values, your set of morals.","The happiest people, the ones you like the most, they're never worried about being rich.","You're either ghetto or you're not.","I could care less about the radio or the TV or album sales. I want that connection with people because when I'm able to walk down the street, I want them to feel like I've done something for them and helped their life because I've never felt that way about a musician.","Some people make their best music when life is horrible.","My cares come from a very selfish place 'cause in reality I'm young, and I haven't had the experience to be mature yet.","The place where you're from defines who you are. You put yourself in the wrong situation, the wrong things happen.","I want to have an impact because I don't want anybody to have to go through what I went through.","What's important to me is people just being people.","At a very young age, I could look at people and tell that everyone was, in a sense, worthless in their own mind. And you couldn't trust anyone. No one was good.","Basic emotions can be conveyed through anything. As long as you show people that you're human, they'll relate to it.","Some people lose sense of what their music was when their life starts to get better.","Every project has to stand on its own. It's a different identity within each project, and I feel like that's the way it should be.","When I was growing up, skateboarding was big and basketball was big.","The best song is what resonates with that one person the most. It's why, if you ask a million people on the face of the Earth, they're all gonna have different favorite songs, their own best song ever, because that's the one that touched them the most.","Touring helped me understand where I needed to be better in my music.","Separation is very important to me. I don't strive to be a celebrity. My music has nothing to do with me at the end of the day. Once it's made and it's purchased, it belongs to whoever.","You have to captivate and entertain if you want your message to get across.","Care and pity are two different things."],"Vince Vaughn":["I enjoy going out by myself... always have, always will. I don't have security guards, and, for the most part, I enjoy meeting new people. I see myself as a regular guy who likes playing video games with his nieces and nephews and poker with his family. I don't have an art collection or take exotic vacations. I enjoy being at home.","The thing about Chicago is that it really isn't like any other place. The architecture and the layout of the city are the best. I'm from the Midwest, and consider myself a Midwesterner. I feel most at home there. I love California. I have great friends in California. I just have always considered Illinois to be home.","My father came from nothing, so he believed that people could do anything if they worked hard enough. I think he liked that I chose to be an actor. Both he and my mom were totally supportive.","Any guy hates Valentine's Day. Even if you're in love, you can't win on Valentine's Day. If you're married, you can't win on Valentine's Day. Valentine's Day is like the thing you want to avoid at all costs.","You don't worry about being liked. You have to be yourself.","It's great extremes which leads to great drama and great comedy.","Whenever you're scared of something, don't let that define you. We all feel it, but step up.","If an ordinary person parks outside another ordinary person's house for a week, it's considered stalking. If, however, that person is considered newsworthy, it's perfectly legal for paparazzi to do the same thing.","For me, I love California. I feel like it's my second home in that I moved out by choice at eighteen. It gave me opportunities that I didn't have anywhere else.","I've never been big on cars. When I first got to Hollywood, I bought a used car from Avis. I drove that until I almost had to pay someone to tow it away.","If I'm saying a universal truth, but maybe it's something that people don't feel comfortable saying... It's a strange take, but at the same time, what you're hitting on is kind of right. You can relate. That's the heart of comedy. You have to have a point of view. You gotta commit. And the more you commit to it, sometimes the funnier it gets.","I'm a Cubs fan. As a kid, the Cubs were my team.","I probably follow all sports a little bit. I like hockey quite a bit. I like football. I like college basketball when it gets down to March Madness. I like baseball. I enjoy them all. I watch them all.","If I'm not interested in a woman, I'm straight-forward. Right after sex, I usually say, 'I can't do this anymore. Thanks for coming over!'","I loved Old School. I thought Old School was very different than a lot of the comedies that had come out. And that character I liked. I tried to ground him very much in reality and play him very much finding things important to him that are somewhat ridiculous.","I moved out at 18. I always studied classes and trained a lot, you know. I think nowadays is such a different time because there's so many channels promoting the celebrity aspect of things.","I was lucky I always got along with girls. It was never like a big deal. I had a lot of girls that I was friends with that I wasn't sexual with. I think having two older sisters made me comfortable like that. I just like people, so I can just go up and say whatever.","The last book I read was the book I've been rereading most of my life, The Fountainhead.","I was a bed wetter till very late. My mom used to hang my sheets out the window to dry, and I'd have to run home from school in order to beat the other kids to my house so they wouldn't see them.","I didn't own a cell phone for a long time. I was late in the game on that.","Some people really like to get into Twitter, but it's not my thing.","I saw a '60 Minutes' piece on Google as a place to work. It was such a foreign concept from what I understood as a regular job. There's free food, sleeping pods, Ping-Pong. I'm the kind of guy who likes to get involved in everything - I'd be all over the Ping-Pong.","I'm not a big gadget guy. When I write, I'll do the whole thing by hand, and then I'll put it into the computer.","When you're younger, you feel like work is work and relationships are supposed to be easy. As you get older, you realize you have to work at relationships to make them sustainable.","All of us have a lot of sides to ourselves, but the fun thing about being actor is you make one side predominant for the character you're playing.","I feel like as you get older, the roles you get change, and you don't always want to do the same tone over and over again.","I was never a big fashion person, and so I'm sure I wore whatever. I was growing, and so I just wore whatever clothes that weren't that expensive and made sense at the time. But I'm sure that I look back and say, 'What was I thinking?' My adolescence was more in the '80s, and that's more my cross to bear.","I love Snoop. I worked with him on 'Old School,' and he's very accessible. He's very kind. He's always nice to everyone, to the crew. He's always got something positive to say. He's very childlike and loves to come and play. So, I had fun working with him.","I'm a horrible golfer.","I played football. I wrestled. Those were team sports and I played for the school. When I was younger, I played kick the can and stuff like that. I loved that.","I have a preference for film just because of the familiarity. It's what I know, and I sort of have nostalgia for it.","I've always been a fan of a Johnny Carson because he was so great with an audience and not afraid of self-deprecating humor.","It's grueling never knowing if the audience is going to think you're funny. It's soul-destroying when they don't laugh.","My dad's name is Vernon and my mom liked the initials, V. V. My sisters and I got named Victoria, Valerie and Vincent so we'd be V. V.'s, too. But, then when you start getting pets' names that start with a 'v,' it's a little embarrassing.","You'll never meet a nicer guy than Owen Wilson.","I think with improv - and I say it all the time because it's become such a catch thing that you talk about improv - if the scene is well-written, you don't need to improv. But that being said, if something strikes you in the moment and, most importantly, you know where the scene is supposed to go, it's no different than method acting.","If you've been on the covers of some magazines and been in a few movies that have been seen by people, for some reason, women seem to be drawn to you.","I'm not running for office. I just want people to come to my stuff and escape and see me as a character, not as anything else.","As an artist, I can't be responsible for how people interpret material.","My approach as an actor has always been the same, in that the greatest gift that you're ever going to have is your imagination because you're not going to have all life experiences. So you draw on things that are sort of close to it but you spend your time expanding on it or drawing something specific on whatever your situation is.","I've always just talked to my family and my friends. I've never been a person that's gone through excessive therapy at all. Some people might say that I should.","I love actors and I feel like, if you usually allow people some say, most people, if they start to feel comfortable, they're going to have a voice. If they feel heard, then they will give back 10 times as much to you.","I think too many people look at the arts with a religious outlook. Arts, music, singing and performing, it's all make-believe.","I could keep trying to do the same kind of comedies. You know how it's going to go, and you can get an audience with it, but then I feel like a hamster on a wheel.","I've been lucky to work with people that I like most of the time. If I don't like them, I'll play head games with them to get their minds spinning.","The incentive for digging up gossip has become so great that people will break the law for the opportunity to take that picture. Then it crosses the line into invasion of privacy. The thing that's really bad about it, though, is that the tabloids don't tell the truth."],"Vincent Bugliosi":["Contrary to common belief, the presumption of innocence applies only inside a courtroom. It has no applicability elsewhere, although the media do not seem to be aware of this.","Yeah, I lost court cases and misdemeanor juries, but of felony jury trials I was successful 105 of 106 times.","Within the pages of The Betrayal of America I prove that these justices were absolutely up to no good, and they deliberately set out to hand the election to George Bush.","Nearly all Americans felt they knew JFK intimately, his charm and wit regularly lighting up the television screen at home. This is why polls showed that millions of Americans took his assassination like a 'death in the family.'","If there is one thing that I take pride in, it is the fact that I never, ever make a charge without offering a substantial amount of support for it. You may ultimately end up not agreeing with me, but you will have to concede that I offered much evidence in support of my position, something that people frequently do not do.","A very beautiful honey blonde, Sharon Tate, looked into the eyes of the man who the evidence shows just four and a half months later would order her tragic and violent death.","And I think within the pages of The Betrayal of America I think I present an overwhelming case that these five justices were up to no good, and they deliberately set out to hand the election to George Bush.","'Helter-Skelter' was the motive for the murders. Manson borrowed that term from a Beatles song on the 'White Album.' In England, helter-skelter is a playground ride. To Manson, helter-skelter meant a war between whites and blacks that the Beatles were in favor of.","Though there are some notable exceptions, by and large the persistent ranting of the Warren Commission critics, some of whom were screaming the word 'conspiracy' before the fatal bullet had even come to rest, came to remind me, as H. L. Mencken said in a different context, of dogs barking idiotically through endless nights.","The question in the Simpson case has never been whether he is guilty or not guilty but, given the facts and circumstances of this case, whether it is possible for him to be innocent. And the answer to that question has always been an unequivocal no.","The very name 'Manson' has become a metaphor for evil... He has come to represent the dark and malignant side of humanity, and for whatever reason, there is a side of human nature that is fascinated with ultimate evil.","All humans make mistakes. But there is no room or allowance in the fevered world of conspiracy theorists for mistakes, human errors, anomalies, or plain incompetence, though the latter, from the highest levels on down, is endemic to our society.","Although the evidence at this trial shows that Charles Manson was the leader of the conspiracy to commit these murders, there is no evidence that he actually personally killed any of the seven victims in this case.","Just like I'm still angry with Simpson for getting by with two murders.","One of the people that wrote a forward to my book is Gerry Spence, whom I admire. Gerry is a friend of mine, and Gerry's perhaps the leading criminal defense attorney in the country.","So I don't blame Boies for the decision of the Court at all.","The Florida Supreme Court wanted all the legal votes to be counted. The United States Supreme Court, on the other hand, did not want all the votes to be counted.","The votes of 60,000 Floridians were not counted. The Court threw out all 60,00 votes. And that's what the newspapers around the country are counting now.","There is no question at all that Manson was sending Tex, Sadie, Katie, and Linda out on his mission of murder.","You might not agree with me, but I always offer a lot of support.","This is America, not a banana republic.","These people have elevated audacity to symphonic and operatic levels. The Florida Supreme Court relied on new law to resolve the election dispute down there.","The ruling in the Paula Jones case is so silly.","The felonious five in their Supreme Court decision never said Gore did anything improperly in Florida.","It's unbelievable, there's a book out attacking Gore, when he's the most unfortunate loser in political history.","It's my view that any conservative who loves his country has to be extremely concerned.","It was OK for the media to pursue Former President Clinton year after year for lying about a private, consensual sexual affair, but we have five justices who committed one of the biggest crimes in American History, and it ceased to be a big story.","If you're honest with yourself, you're going to find out whether you truly love America, or whether your primary allegiance is to the Republican party.","If it's a close election, then it's better for the Supreme Court to pick the president, whether or not he won the election. It's just insane on its face.","I'm trying to finish my book on the Kennedy assassination.","I'm still angry with Simpson for getting by with two murders.","I view myself primarily as a trial lawyer who happens to be writing, as opposed to a writer who happens to be a trial lawyer, so the audience is like a jury to me.","I think I present an overwhelming case that these five justices were up to no good, and they deliberately set out to hand the election to George Bush.","I lost court cases and misdemeanor juries, but of felony jury trials I was successful 105 of 106 times.","A national legal organization is giving very serious thought to using The Betrayal of America as a legal basis for asking the House Judiciary Committee to institute impeachment proceedings against these five justices.","No matter what I do, I'll be forever known as the Manson prosecutor.","I, for one, can't be sure at all there is a God.","If anyone should be executed, it should be Charles Manson. Do I go around during the daytime, 'Geez, I'm upset that he's alive'? No, I don't even think about him. I don't think about this case.","I've actually had a copilot come out of the cockpit on a trip from L.A. to New York and ask me about Charles Manson.","I was at a book convention, in a cab. On one side of me was Arthur Schlesinger; on the other side was William Manchester - real heavyweights. All they were doing was asking me about Charles Manson. The only thing that enables me not to be bored is the people talking about it - they're so interested.","We should not televise trials. There's only one purpose for a criminal trial. It's to determine whether or not the defendant committed the crime. Anything that interferes or has the potential of interfering with that should automatically be prohibited.","Although I've been a longtime Democrat (primarily because, unless there is some very compelling reason to be otherwise, I am always for 'the little guy'), my political orientation is not rigid. For instance, I supported John McCain's run for the presidency in 2000.","This book here, 'The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder,' in it, I put together a case against George Bush that could result - it absolutely could result in his being prosecuted for first-degree murder in an American courtroom.","I am more excited about 'Divinity of Doubt: The God Question' than any other book in my entire career, and I've had seven New York Times bestsellers, three of them reaching number one.","Atheism is really nothing but a sorry litany of non-sequiturs, e.g., if God existed, why do we have all the evil and horrors in the world? But this presupposes that God is all-good, an obvious non-sequitur.","We can know that the Christian God cannot exist. If he is all-powerful and all-good, as Christians maintain, there would not have been, for instance, the Holocaust. This is an inherent self-contradiction. So if Christians insist on having a God, they can do so, but if they have any respect for logic they'll have to redefine who he is.","I believe that the question of the existence of God is an impenetrable mystery and beyond human comprehension.","For the life of me, I still don't understand why humans pray.","When I hear theists and atheists pontificating on how they know God does or does not exist, I can only smile at the irrationality and, yes, vanity of the notion.","Just look at what is right in front of you. People don't do that. They see what they expect to see, what they want to see, what conventional wisdom tells them to see. They only hear the music and not the lyrics of human events.","Since Kennedy's death, the nation has not seen, in any of his successors, his cosmopolitan intellectualism or the oratorical eloquence with which he sought to lead the nation by the power of his words.","Even if a sense of honor and duty were not the primary motivating factors in the Warren Commission's work, simple self-interest would naturally have induced its members not to try to cover up the existence of a conspiracy if, in fact, they found one.","Over a hundred million Americans reject the findings of the Warren Commission, whose report at least ninety-nine out of a hundred have never read.","In my opinion, the Warren Commission's investigation has to be considered the most comprehensive investigation of a crime in history.","A tactic used by authors of virtually every single book I've ever read that propounds a conspiracy theory is to attack an agency as being part of a conspiracy in the Kennedy assassination, but when this same agency comes up with something favorable to the author's position, the author will cite that same agency as credible support for his argument.","As a trial lawyer in front of a jury and an author of true-crime books, credibility has always meant everything to me. My only master and my only mistress are the facts and objectivity. I have no others.","The very best testament to the validity of the Warren Commission's findings is that after an unrelenting, close to forty-five-year effort, the Commission's fiercest critics have not been able to produce any new credible evidence that would in any way justify a different conclusion.","One thing I have seen over and over again in life is that there is virtually no correlation between intelligence and common sense. IQ doesn't seem to translate that way.","I take no pride in having been the first public personality to come out publicly against Simpson. It just happened that way.","Our system, for readily apparent reasons, is far superior to those in nations, mostly totalitarian, which presume an arrested person is guilty and place the burden on the accused to prove his innocence.","I start out with the assumption that a lawyer in a criminal case is going to be incompetent - substantially so. I find my assumption to be rarely wrong. Yet society starts out with the very opposite assumption.","The reality is that most celebrity defendants are extremely unknowledgeable, naive, and vulnerable, and if they get into trouble, they usually call their lawyer friends who handle criminal cases, and if they don't know any, they call their business lawyers, who then refer them to lawyer friends of theirs.","We're a nation of celebrity and hero worshipers, so much so that we make heroes out of those who aren't, such as John Wayne: a patriotic, red-blooded, two-fisted American who spent the Second World War in the trenches on the movie lots of Hollywood.","As a trial lawyer, intelligence is important only in the sense that it allows you to play the game, if you will. Without it, you don't even have a ticket into the competitive arena. But beyond that, it doesn't get you very far at all.","Most people see what they expect to see, what they want to see, what they've been told to see, what conventional wisdom tells them to see - not what is right in front of them in its pristine condition."],"Vincent Canby":["We are drawn to our television sets each April the way we are drawn to the scene of an accident.","Good fiction reveals feeling, refines events, locates importance and, though its methods are as mysterious as they are varied, intensifies the experience of living our own lives.","Hack fiction exploits curiosity without really satisfying it or making connections between it and anything else in the world.","His acting remains forever fixed in a time that never dates.","It is guaranteed to put all teeth on edge, including George Washington's, wherever they might be."],"Vincent Cassel":["I feel like the so-called bad guys are never totally bad. I guess it's the closest thing I can do to reality: people act nice but nobody really is nice. We all have to balance that with something dark.","People pretend to be nice; people pretend to be smooth and polite and everything, but this is only an appearance because the way we're built as human beings is only in paradox and contradictions.","You can't escape from what you are.","I feel to look for perfection is a very dangerous path. More than that, it's dangerous because it doesn't exist. You can aim for it, but you already know you won't get there because it doesn't exist. Plus, I definitely think the flaws, little cracks, and accidents are a lot more interesting.","'Brotherhood of the Wolf' is a very important movie because it represents something new. The director Christophe Gans came up with the idea of taking a French legend and making it some kind of really strange, almost Chinese action movie. The result is something that I haven't seen anywhere before.","I guess I look strange a bit. Strange but confident. I'm not like a model or anything. I always compare this to wearing a hat. You can wear the strangest hat, but if you think it's cool, then you'll look cool.","I grew up watching 'Raging Bull.'","I was much more interested by clothes when I was younger. I'm about being discreet. What they call the French touch, whatever that means. Low profile and somehow elegant without being flashy.","All good actors are actresses. The more like a woman they are, the better they act, because a man's salvation is his femininity. Women have stronger sensibilities than men, which allows them to go a bit deeper when they are on and off the stage.","I have a physical background. It's not like I'm a kung fu master, but my real training was dance school, and through that, I move to this thing called Capruera that I used in 'Ocean's 12.' I can pretend that I can do a lot of things, but then, I don't really master anything.","I'm a little angry in life.","I think I'm actually more vulnerable than people imagine.","The minute your parents die, you stop fighting them. I realized the more I changed my face for films, the more I looked like him. I always liked to disguise myself because I was trying to run away from his image. But all that is not worth it.","I wear a lot of wigs as Jacques Mesrine. He'd wear multiple wigs and take them off one at a time to rob three banks in one hour.","Female influence came from my grandmother and my aunt. They would sing Corsican love songs while cleaning the house and dress all in black and say melodramatic things like: 'I want to die.'","Many times, I have heard people saying that they don't like to work with their wife or husband, but to me, it is a plus. To work with somebody you love makes filming faster, more fun.","My father is best known for his light comedies, and I'm best known for crazy bad guys with short tempers.","I used to be more self-conscious about style because when you're younger, you want to exist, you want to show everything you do.","The minute I started being recognised, I became much more discreet.","People look up to Jacques Mesrine as if he were a Robin Hood, stealing from the rich, but he never gave anything back to anybody.","I always had the sense of being in the spotlight, being on stage, being looked at.","When eventually I started to act a bit more, I realised that circus school had taught me something that a lot of actors my age didn't have: physicality. They didn't know how to move. Acting is not all about talking. There is something animalistic about it.","To work with somebody you love makes filming faster, more fun.","I ran away from three different boarding schools before joining a circus school, and eventually I became an actor. The only thing I learned at boarding school was never to send my child to one.","I didn't have many girlfriends in my youth. I was an active young man, jumping from one girl to the next, but never with anyone for more than three or four months.","There's only so much you can control in life.","I have learned that acting is not about beauty.","They say the day you lose your parents, you start to look like them.","I did direct two short movies. I learned many things, and one of the things I learned was that I am not a director. It has to be visceral, and it's not for me. I feel much more comfortable acting.","I come from an acting family, my father was an actor, and I had to fight my way and just create my own identity.","Working with David Cronenberg or Darren Aronofsky or even Steven Soderbergh isn't really like a typical Hollywood movie. These are true artists, and have a certain amount of freedom when they work, and they're more like independent filmmakers making their way through big studios.","The idea of telling a story in reverse destabilises your ordinary moral reactions. That's one of the points of art - to challenge your preconceptions.","When you see violence in movies in general, it's very quick and painless, which isn't what it's like.","I really enjoy being an actor!","People ask me where I live most of the time, and it's kind of complicated for me to answer, because I'm not really sure. It's somewhere in between London, Rome, Paris, and Rio.","I love French style from the Thirties and Forties. French movie stars like Jean Gabin and Yves Montand had so much natural, effortless style.","I'm an actor, that's what I do every day. Dressing up is part of my job. But whatever you wear you should always be yourself: never go totally with the fashion but use what there is available to be an individual.","I don't really shop any more. I only do it when I have to. I think it is very overrated.","I've always loved the idea of changing myself, wearing costumes and disguises. It takes you back to being a kid, to dressing up.","I don't think France is a racist country, I really don't, but we do still have many problems with our immigrant past, and there's a shame that goes with that, that works both ways, in the host and in the post-immigrant generation.","And now I have a big house, nice clothes and I travel in first class and I love it, so maybe it's time to enjoy being a star.","I was thinking of going to London drama schools or to New York, because France didn't accommodate the things I wanted to do in film.","Cinema is entertainment, and people go to the movies because they want to feel good and forget about everything.","I'm more attracted to the bad guys. Why? Because in real life, I don't know any good guys. I know okay guys. I know polite guys. I know people who can control themselves.","I'm producing more, but I think to direct, one has to have a burning desire, and that's not me. I'd rather do something else.","There is this idea that it's very different from the French point of view to work in America blah, blah, blah. But I think it's different from one person to the other, not from one country to the other.","I worked with young directors all my life, only young directors.","Cronenberg's a lot of fun, and that a lot of people don't know watching his movies. He doesn't take himself seriously. He's still reinventing himself.","The day after I had my licence to drive, I made Paris/Nice at 230 km/hour.","My character in 'La Haine,' he's not bad; he's unhappy, and usually, people are like that. Most of us are angry.","If most women are looking for security, I think men look for adventure.","I know that what I see in every religious person is not something I want to teach my kids.","From my point of view, I'm a totally normal person! Really! I have a family. I have kids. I have a house... I don't have a dog.","I was a dancer, and my father was a dancer, so I really grew up in that environment.","Every movie, especially when you get involved... takes something out of you. You learn something, but you give something to the movie. And after the movie, if the experience has been intense and a true experience, you're a little different afterward.","The first important movie that I did, I shaved my head for the movie. When the hair grew back, I had white hair for the first time in my life.","I work everywhere. If there is a nice adventure in South Korea, for example, why not? Russia, Brazil, whatever. I'm ready for almost anything.","My problem is I can't show any of my movies to my daughters. It's tough. 'Beauty and the Beast'... they liked it. But that's the only one, really. Otherwise, they've always been dark or violent.","My father danced a lot. He was called 'the French Fred Astaire.'","In Italy, it is difficult to see a film in the original language because the voice actors here are a mafia.","I spent a lot of time in boarding school. This is something I will never do to my kids. I think if you're having kids, then you have to take care of them; otherwise, what's the point? There are many things that parents say are good for the kids, but the truth is they say that because it is good for the parents.","I'm moving to Rio permanently with my family. It's one of the places left in the world where people still live with a big charge of poetry on a daily basis. I feel we've kind of lost that here in Europe.","As an actor, I think you should always disappear a little. I act in order to lose myself.","Since I was a child, I have had this feeling that the most important work I'd do would be with my family.","I'm actually beginning to believe that there is something in common among all of my characters. I'm not sure what it is exactly. But I guess that something is me.","I trained as a dancer when I was much younger, for a large amount of time, like 6 or 7 years. Not to be a ballet dancer, actually, but I thought it was a complement for an actor. I thought that actors should know how to move, should know how to juggle, should know how to do acrobatics.","What came out of 'Ocean's Twelve' is actually great because you do one 'Ocean's Twelve,' and you're more known around the world than if you did 20 years in the French cinema industry.","Soderbergh is a very respectable director that manages to have an incredible amount of freedom in a system that doesn't allow anybody to be free as he is on a set. And he will jump from 'Solaris' to 'Ocean's Twelve' and 'Thirteen.'","I think people have a misinterpretation of Method acting, because Method acting is a wonderful thing. The thing is, if you take it too seriously, it's like religion. You start to think it's the truth. But it's not the truth. It's just a way to get somewhere.","Hollywood, for me, is the studios. It's a way to produce. It's a different way to make movies, and I never took part in that.","The few times in my life where I had four or five movies in a row, it was a nightmare. I felt trapped. I felt like my life was planned for a year and a half or two years, and it was terrible. Most of the time, everything collapsed.","I love to act. And between action and cuts, when you work for somebody great, it's wonderful, and I still love it. The moment where you create, that instant is still magic to me. But, all the rest, I get bored with it - all the waiting, and the fact that you have to make appearances, that you have to share your life.","When you appear on the screen, often enough you become sexy, even if you look like an elephant.","I always compare human beings to animals. It's a nice way to figure out who they are.","I think American audiences like gangster movies. You know, it's part of the culture.","I have a tendency to think that when you portray baddies in movies, they come out more human than good guys.","French men can be very tough too, you know... Real bad boys move in silence, as we know, so you don't have to be loud and muscular to be scary, actually.","I think it's much harder to have a long dialogue scene than an action scene. An action scene is long, but it's not really hard. It's kind of boring, really. It looks good at the end, but to shoot it, it's not the most exciting thing.","What I think I'm perceived as in France is, like, I'm this leading man always doing strange movies because most of the movies I did, like 'Irreversible' or 'Brotherhood of the Wolf' and a bunch of others, and even in France, they always come out as a particular movie, not like the typical French kind of movies that people know most of the time.","If I have to pretend to be anything else than French, then I know it's work for me. It's not that it scares me, but it's work. I cannot just pop up on the set and say 'Okay, today I'm Italian!'","I'm really proud of 'Oceans 12.' Of course, you do an 'Oceans' movie, you get known all over the world. It's an incredibly powerful medium: It's a Hollywood-identified blockbuster.","I spent a whole year in New York without going back to France. And I always came back because my mother was living in New York since I was 13. So I went to summer camps, hang out at the Roxy, go to class for ballet, so I always had part of my life in New York.","As a younger actor, I had delusions. I would dream of Scorsese and De Niro; I would meet people, and it would be like this, and it would change moviemaking in France, and Paris would become the center of the world.","Actually, I never work in movies for money. I'm glad when I get well-paid, but it's not always the case - trust me.","The relationship I have to everyday life is very European. We have a different relationship with religion, with faith, with nudity, with sex, with food.","Instead of playing heroes and righteous people, I'd rather portray characters with problems of conscience who have to lie, to betray, and then have to cope with that. They feel more true to me.","French people are never happy with what they have. They're always complaining. They're happy when they're complaining.","Acting is such a feminine process: you have to become the desire of others. I'm OK with this, and so is Gerard Depardieu. In many ways, he's very feminine.","I still wear my trousers baggy as I did in my teens. But in a different way. I've loved trainers since my youth - limited edition, vintage, whatever. You could recognise people and judge their character through their trainers. I'm a Nike man.","I love Cartier. They are the classic French jeweller."],"Vincent D'Onofrio":["To me the definition of true masculinity - and femininity, too - is being able to lay in your own skin comfortably.","It's pretty simple, pretty obvious: that people's first impressions of people are really a big mistake.","When you look at people, you should look at more than what you see on the surface; you should try to find a soul.","I guess I say this for younger actors out there: you have to be brave, and you have to be ready to fail, and that's the only way you can be unique. So when a director is confident enough in what they're doing, and they allow their actors to be brave and bring in stuff, the more likely it's going to work out okay.","Unless you look like Brad Pitt, it's really hard to have full control of your character.","Doing 'Law & Order' for so long, my fan base was, like, men and women my age, and then doing 'Daredevil', my whole audience has changed. It's cool.","What kind of recognition do I deserve? I don't deserve any recognition.","And I have been able to establish this sort of decent reputation as being a decent character actor.","I'll be working the rest of my life because I'm a character actor and don't have to worry about box office.","The only thing I do worry about is that the more films I do the more visible I am going to become as a personality because of press and because of the sheer quantity of films.","Like De Niro. He's one of the best character actors we have ever had.","The more you are known, the more difficult it is to hide behind characters.","This haunting idea of becoming a celebrity doesn't settle well with me at all.","Then I did Mystic Pizza, just to do something I wasn't fat in.","With Altman, he does discuss everything with you, but then leaves you to it and gives you full rein and lets you improvise and create a character while the camera is rolling.","Look, all you can do when you find your niche is go with it.","If you try to go beyond your interests just for the sake of pretensions or wealth, your art becomes less legitimate.","I found my niche as a character actor, and I've never felt like a movie star or teen idol and never wanted to.","I've never tried to be something I'm not.","No, I knew when I was doing theater in New York that this was what I was supposed to be doing.","And then, as the years went on, I just kept moving along, busting into doors and getting roles, until I started to actually believe that what these other people were saying was true.","I think that being a producer is business and being an actor is art.","My partner Dan Ireland wants me to direct, and I read a lot of scripts - some good enough that I could see myself. But then it's like, so what? Who cares? Let someone else direct it.","People who are extremely inside their head, like he was, are caught in a neurosis that goes round and round. Then something will hook them and take them to their end and they can't control it.","The Whole Wide World is the first movie I've ever produced.","When I was younger I used to pick things just to face the fear.","So I moved to Europe and only came back when directors like Robert Altman would call me after they'd seen my work in Full Metal Jacket.","But the one thing that I did do was establish myself as a good actor.","So a failed movie is not going to ruin my career.","When you are a character actor they trust you will go in and give them a full character and leave.","It's like why people read scary books or go see scary movies. Because it creates a distance. They're scared, but they're not going to get hurt.","It doesn't need to be a No 1 show, it just needs to be good.","The minute you start feeling like you've got it down, you know what you're doing, you're dead in the water.","I want every episode to feel like we still haven't done this right yet.","At our best, it's a good experience but we do 22 episodes a year, so there are some clunkers.","They were all interested in what I was going to do, because I'd never worked in televsion before.","Our show is different, because it's not about law and order, it's about psychology, the intent of somebody.","I took a route of acting, rather than starmaking, so it cost me a lot financially.","It doesn't need to be a number one show, it just needs to be good.","I'm a character actor, and I made a choice when I was young, after 'Mystic Pizza', not to go for the mainstream stuff, and to do a more eclectic kind of route.","The search for the truth is not for the faint hearted.","Evil changes everybody!","Some scenes you juggle two balls, some scenes you juggle three balls, some scenes you can juggle five balls. The key is always to speak in your own voice. Speak the truth. That's Acting 101. Then you start putting layers on top of that.","Acting is not a mystery. There's nothing that I know that other actors don't know. We all act, we're all actors, we all know the same thing. The only thing that separates us is experience.","The most fun you can possibly have as an actor is to walk that line between what's real and what's interesting.","All of us are trying to achieve 100 percent in our work. That's all we struggle to do. We never do, but we never stop trying until the day we die. It's that struggle to achieve 100 percent, that's where our performance lies, that's what the audience gets. They get the struggle.","When you're a child, you're able to assimilate so easily into any situation. You even start talking like the people you're around. I wasn't conscious that I was so good at that until I started to truly feel like an actor.","The thing about Marvel is that they're not - they're into real acting. They're looking for artists that are willing to take chances and are willing to create characters. Even if that character has been around for years and years in comic books, they still are depending on us to create something and take it somewhere else.","I read Spider-Man, and that's how I knew about Wilson Fisk.","Frank Miller and David Mack are incredible artists.","When you're acting, it should be the most important thing that's going on. But when you're not, leave it alone.","I am a method actor, but I'm also a film actor as well as a method actor. Characters that don't have humility, whether they are heroes or villains, are hard to relate to. All characters in every aspect of what we do should have humility. If they don't, then they're a cartoon character.","I never was happy with the job I did in 'Ed Wood.'","I have changed so much as an actor over the years.","Until I got 'Full Metal Jacket,' I was doing Off-Off-Broadway plays with three people in the audience.","I learned a lot from Dick Wolf. I'll always remember playing that character because it was such a good character. It was great to be able to be a character like that for television. I think the thing that I'll bring from the whole experience, the whole 10 years, is I had never been interested in the television business before.","I did a film called 'Fire with Fire.'","When I played Robert Howard in 'The Whole Wide World', I was struggling with it. There's this dual thing where you feel real good about being able to play this juicy part, and then there's constant shame: 'Who am I to pretend to know who this guy was? Who am I to represent this guy for people who never knew him?'","I'm not gonna play a part that doesn't instill some kind of fear in me. If I read a part, and suddenly, I'm thinking halfway through, 'I'm not sure I could get away with this,' I think of everything I can think of to keep me from doing it, that's the one I should do.","When I did 'The Cell' - no matter what you think of that movie, because I have my opinions of it too - it was, you know, I still have nightmares from the research that I did. Not from playing the part, just from the research."],"Vincent Frank":["A large part of crime is economics - if people are working and and have a home and family to support, then I believe you can reduce the crime rate.","As a planning board commissioner, I have to review the applications for development throughout the city, and the bulk of those applications have been for the waterfront. I think the progress the waterfront has made is amazing.","I believe the challenge the city faces is attracting continued development into the inner and western part of Jersey City. Nobody should be left behind as Jersey City continues to prosper and grow.","I would first recommend we appoint a Police Director that commands the respect of the rank and file.","I am in favor of community policing because it builds better working relationships with the communities.","I've also committed my time and resources to many local organizations like Christmas in April, Catholic Community Services, and Hudson County Meals on Wheels.","I don't think the process was successful and should be inspected closer. I am not afraid to say I am not familiar with the entire process, so before commenting further I would have to study the process more in depth.","I do feel we can create more jobs and opportunities for Jersey City residents, but in the spirit of free enterprise, I do not think it is right to force companies to hire a fixed percentage of local residents.","We have to scrutinize the entire abatement process to ensure the companies that are under consideration for an abatement truly need one, and I don't believe that is being done now.","Also, if we take back our schools and concentrate on improving them so our children get a better education, they will be better trained to compete for a job locally.","I consider myself an excellent candidate... because I care."],"Vincent Gallo":["I don't trust or love anyone. Because people are so creepy. Creepy creepy creeps. Creeping around. Creeping here and creeping there. Creeping everywhere.","I've never been a popular person, but it doesn't matter. I have everything in my life that I want. I'm not a walking publicity stunt. I'm not an anarchist, or bitter. I'm not trying to be subversive. I just try to remain unguarded, unprotected by fear, and agents and publicists, and I feel comfortable that way.","I constantly try to reinvent my sensibilities and my ideas. I enjoy some of the satisfaction that I get when I feel good about what I've done. But the process is quite lonely and quite painful.","I would be delighted to show my film in the Viennale. I do not offer press kits. I do not offer stills. I do not offer screeners. I do not offer DVD's. I do not offer posters. I require a first-class flight to bring the print however I do not offer any photo ops or press exchange in any way. My fee for showing my film is $35,000 dollars US.","I'm sort of like a maniac, and I can't get out of it.","My parents took an interest in nothing, at home no books, no records. My mother and my father are the emblem of indifference, dryness and bad taste. My father is also terribly stingy, in life as well as in feelings: I have never seen him filling up the bathtub.","I'm so in love with the United States. Not as a patriot. I'm in love with America like it's my first girlfriend. The geography, the people, the smell, the touch, the taste, the gas stations. I'm madly in love with America.","My parents were dishonest people. If it was my birthday, I knew my mother took me to the K-Mart and she stole my toy. She'd put it in the shopping cart and we'd walk out. I was raised with that.","I don't drink any coffee or take any drugs and I don't smoke cigarettes and I don't eat sugar and I don't take any medicine at all. I eat a lot of fish, vegetables, and I stay away from starches.","I never apologized for anything in my life. The only thing I'm sorry about is putting a curse on Roger Ebert's colon. If a fat pig like Roger Ebert doesn't like my movie, then I'm sorry for him.","I'm sorry I'm not gay or Jewish, so I don't have a special interest group of journalists that support me.","I never wanted to be an actor. I never want to be an actor. I want to be a movie star. The whole idea of having to act is too gruesome. It's too ambitious for me.","I do not want my new works to be generated in a market or audience of any kind.","I am available to all women - all women who can afford me, that is.","If I gain support, the support doesn't seem to mean anything. It's not like anyone really cares about me.","I drive out to this quail farm, where I get a lot of these incredible quail eggs, which I eat all day long. And I eat a lot of superfoods like goji, cacao and chia seeds, things like that. And I like unpasteurised milk of the goat and the sheep. They send it once a week from Pennsylvania, from the Amish farms, and I get it in Los Angeles.","I stopped painting in 1990 at the peak of my success just to deny people my beautiful paintings, and I did it out of spite.","I heard my mother talking badly of me to people who were talking badly of me in her salon. That's probably the thing that I'm most sensitive of in all my friendships and my relationships. I just... I just can't take that. I'm comfortable with enemies, but I can't take it from friends.","I didn't want to lose my subjectivity and my objectivity about my work."],"Vincent Kartheiser":["I was, aged nine, the go-to kid in Minneapolis for a commercial voiceover.","Well, I think certain roles are chosen for us. The moment I read Pete Campbell I thought: I can do this, this is mine. And in Money, too. The truth is I turn down a lot of projects. If a character doesn't have some kind of internal struggle, it's no good for me.","I don't have a lot of money. I get some from Mad Men. But I don't think I'm rich.","I've never been monogamous. It might happen, but it never has yet. I don't understand women, I'm off that kick.","I was a nut for Dostoevsky. You can tell a lot from what people read between those ages. My brother was a Steinbeck freak and now he lives in a little village in New Hampshire and he's a baker.","But now I feel off the grid. I feel that I am not part of the culture. And because I don't have a car I don't really go anywhere to buy things. In fact, I have been in a slow process of selling and giving away everything I own.","Storytelling is the important thing.","I've worked with actors before where I was like, this is not working, and then I've seen their work on the screen and I've been like, Wow, that was a really great performance. Because there are a lot of elements with film. It's not like stage. It's not a kind of performance art anymore; it's a highly tuned kind of collaboration - a symphony.","And when I was a kid being an actor was not cool. I'm thirty now and when I was a kid in the 80s that wasn't a cool thing to be.","It's easier to do Shakespeare than Spelling, and I know that sounds crazy, because the challenge of Shakespeare is living up to Shakespeare, living up to that word, not failing, you know, where with Aaron Spelling it's like, just try to look good. Or maybe don't use Spelling there, that's bad. No - you can. He's dead."],"Vincent Lo":["Connections and relationships are important everywhere, anywhere - of course in China, because the rule of law it is not as strong as in the West, so a lot would rely on personal relationships.","I don't believe I want to retire, because I just enjoy and love my work so much.","I like to learn about things. I could learn about business, which I knew nothing about. Since the age of 7, I wanted to be a doctor and nothing else."],"Vincent McNabb":["As you are not yet married, and as marriage is the fundamental state of life as well as the unity of the commonwealth, make up your mind whether you are called to this state. If you make up your mind to marry, do not marry merely a good wife: marry a good mother to your children.","Hope is some extraordinary spiritual grace that God gives us to control our fears, not to oust them.","We cannot go alone to God. We belong to His Mystical Body, the Church; by even our most secret sins, if they be grievous, we have injured the Mystical Body of Jesus Christ and must ask forgiveness of His Mystical Body, too.","The Virgin Birth is possible if there is a God. An Omnipotent Being who can do all things and yet cannot do some things is hardly worth our attack or defence.","The forms of thought, into which we throw our timid views of God, are but symbols of truths greater than our thoughts. Yet we may not set them aside as worthless, for they are the rungs on which we dwellers in the cave climb to the full view of the Truth, as he is.","Sometimes it is a great joy just to listen to someone we love talking.","Quit Babylon for love of the Babylonians.And do not seek ease or security you can obtain by using Babylon. What will it avail you to cease living in Babylon if you do not also cease living on Babylon?","What is superfluous to your poor estate, distribute. This is distributive charity: a virtue so sacred that crimes against it are the forerunner of inevitable doom.","How different would this country be if few were engaged in making money and many in making things.","We shall seek first to tell the truth rather than to study the subtle art of adjusting it to the circumstances of time and person.","We shall not hold the dangerous axiom that 'truth is the best policy,' because policy is but a means to an end; and truth is an end, not a means.","Of a truth, there is an inward, formless, inarticulate, almost unconscious, prayer, the very breath of love, whereby the soul is knit fast to the God whom it has tracked, amidst the tangled underwood of human life, to his covert on the eternal hills.","That mystic clasp of love lies not on the threshold but at the end of spiritual life, and can be reached for the most part only after much spiritual exercising, many denials, self-denials, watchings, and, it may be, the Cross of pain and disillusionment.","One of the essential and most valid objections against the act of faith is that it is irrational, inasmuch as it offends against the syllogistic rule that the conclusion of an argument shall contain nothing more than the premises.","Though many men would be content to follow Christ by taking up their cross, few would be willing to follow Him by denying their reason.","It is no more irrational for the mind to take the word of the Eternal Word than for the eye to use light and for the ear to welcome sound.","The deductive reasons for a course of action usually follow rather than precede the course of action. Thought follows life.","St. Thomas is right. The essential prayer is the prayer of petition.","Certain gifts God makes to the human soul without its asking or desiring; but there are other gifts which the grown-up soul, with the use of reason, can only have by its desire.","Ordinary Catholics are praying when they do not think they are. They are praying when they offer implicitly all they are doing to God.","It is somewhat surprising that collections of the 'hundred best books,' which usually begin with the Bible and generally include Marcus Aurelius, should give no place to the Acts of the General Councils, though mere literary works have done little beyond filling vacant hours, and these Acts have renewed the face of the earth.","Perhaps no General Council has been more naturally fitted than the Vatican Council to produce a masterpiece of religious thought and literature. No assembly of men since the time of Christ has ever been so representative of Christian and national thought.","Marriage is an indissoluble state of life wherein a man and a woman agree to give each other power over their bodies for the begetting, birth, and upbringing of offspring.","As the wedded pair have given each other power over their bodies, it would be a grave sin for one to refuse either altogether or for a considerable time the fulfilment of the marriage debt.","Most humbly, my beloved Saviour, I bow myself before thee. I am a worm and no man. I alone deserve to suffer. I alone shrink from suffering. I was with thee in thy days of joy, singing 'Hosanna,' and I wished to make thee King. Now, in thine hour of suffering, I am far from thee.","No sin, especially no great sin, is just a harm done to the individual who commits it. I believe myself that the future of the human race is bound up with that idea. The soul that is conscious of a grievous sin is conscious of a great harm done to the community - to someone else. That common hurt should now be forgiven.","Dear children in Jesus Christ, prayer is absolutely necessary.","Our dear Lord said we should pray always. Everything we are doing should be either a prayer in itself or can be made into a prayer. Any action that is not in itself wrong can be done in union with God and His divine will."],"Vincent Nichols":["The love of husband and wife, which is creative of new human life, is a marvellously personal sharing in the creative love of God who brings into being the eternal soul that comes to every human being with the gift of human life.","We're losing social skills, the human interaction skills, how to read a person's mood, to read their body language, how to be patient until the moment is right to make or press a point. Too much exclusive use of electronic information dehumanises what is a very, very important part of community life and living together.","The only thing that I am ambitious about is to live a good life. Full stop.","In Christ we see a maturity of love that flowers in self-sacrifice and forgiveness; a maturity of power that never swerves from the ideal of service; a maturity of goodness that overcomes every temptation, and, of course, we see the ultimate victory of life over death itself.","A Catholic understanding of priesthood is so strongly rooted in the historic actions of Jesus and in all their antecedents in the place of sacrifice in life. And those things... they are rooted to the role of the man.","Football spectators appreciate a bit of loyalty, and we're seeing that less and less. There are echelons of football, as in society, where some players are clearly mercenaries. I regret in a way that somehow the local identification, the local bonding between the community and its football team has been commercialised to such an extent.","Among young people, often a key factor in them committing suicide is the trauma of transient relationships. They throw themselves into a friendship or network of friendships, then it collapses and they're desolate.","I think there's a worry that an excessive use or an almost exclusive use of text and emails means that as a society we're losing some of the ability to build interpersonal communication that's necessary for living together and building a community.","My parents would always trace the sign of the cross on our foreheads before they kissed us goodnight.","Sexual living is a reflection of God's love for us. It has two key qualities, which is faithfulness and creativity of new life.","You know, in some ways, the celibacy tradition goes back to the tribe of Levi and, certainly, sacrifice and the notion of sacrifice. In the Old Testament, the shedding of blood was for a man to perform. It was not for the woman, who gave life.","In the eyes of the Catholic Church, abortion is a tragedy. Our principle objective must be to try and win greater sympathy for that perspective and for the value of human life from its beginnings.","Faith in God is the gift that takes us beyond our limited self, with all its incessant demands. It opens us to a life that stretches us, enlightens us, and often springs surprises upon us. Such faith, like love, sees that which is invisible and lives by it.","In many ways, the young are more religiously minded than the older generations. I think it's the flip side of an age of individualism. Youngsters are not afraid to tell you what they think, to express their faith and be quite exuberant about it.","One of the things I regret is that too often in our society a person's whole identity is shaped by their sexuality, or by their sexual orientation. In good Catholic eyes, a person's sexual orientation does not matter.","In the Catholic tradition, the idea of giving something up on a Friday - the act of self denial - has always been tied with being generous to those in need.","Pope John Paul II was a great presence on the stage. Pope Benedict is a much more gentle and refined person, and I think he benefits greatly from the television close-ups because he wants to engage in a dialogue, in conversation. He wants to put forward his views in a measured, eloquent, rational way.","I think it is quite remarkable actually that Pope Benedict has a sense of the variety of ways in which it is possible to be a Catholic. I think he is more comfortable with a plurality of expressions of Catholicism in different rites, traditions than many of us are.","I think there is, in our society, there is a growing fear of death, a fear of the circumstances in which I might die, a fear I might be over-treated or under-treated. But fear is always a bad guide. Death is part of life.","For a healthy society, those laws and conventions should always support marriage as an institution characterised by an openness to children and the responsibility of fathers and mothers remaining together to care for children born into their family.","Strong families serve society by bringing forth healthy children and maturing young adults, by being a rich source of a compassion for sick members, of support for others in time of crisis and of care for the elderly and the dying.","No intelligent government can continue to ignore the urgent priority of giving support and practical encouragement to marriage and family stability as the first response to growing social needs.","Those who embrace belief in Christ Jesus are bound together in Him, in a real yet incomplete way, in his Body, the Church. Faith is never a solitary activity, nor can it be simply private. Faith in Christ always draws us into a community and has a public dimension.","The paradox of faith is that when we conform our lives to Christ then we gain our true freedom. And its fruit is profound and lasting happiness.","The problem with God is that we want him to reveal Himself, and He doesn't. We will never understand God."],"Vincent Pastore":["'The Sopranos' wardrobe people would sometimes go over there and just grab stuff off the racks, because B&G has that style that never ages. It's like a '50s or '60s style. It fits me well.","I used to come down from New Rochelle and go to Radio City. They'd have a floor show and a movie. I'm showing my age, but I saw 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' and 'Broken Arrow' with Jimmy Stewart. It was a great way for a kid to see a movie.","When I initially committed to joining 'Dancing with the Stars,' I didn't realize just how physically demanding it would be for me. Unable to put forth my best effort, I felt it appropriate to step aside and give someone else the opportunity."],"Vincent Piazza":["A custom-tailored suit retains a certain dignity about it.","I find historical figures in general very tricky because you feel at times that you're serving two masters. Not only the arc and wonderful writing that comes with the show, but also the history of a person's life.","A lot of people say, 'I always knew Lucky Luciano as a very smooth, very elegant, very powerful man.' All the accounts of him as an older man were that he was very genteel but he still had the look of smothered violence behind his eyes.","As an actor, I like as much time with the material as possible and given the opportunity, time spent with the other actors in the scene. But that is a rare luxury in working in any TV series.","I feel a great responsibility playing a historical figure because whether they were good or bad, I feel like the person deserves a fair shake. It's like being the executor of their estate in some ways.","I applied a lot of the same principles I used in hockey into my acting. I might have had some naive ambitions of making the NHL, but thank God, playing hockey gave me a good foundation for everything else.","I've picked up a great appetite for pastrami on rye and a nice cream soda. It is fantastic. So I have to be careful or I'm going to just get really fat.","I'm a real low profile guy. So a date night for me is kind of curled up at home and watching something... have a nice glass of wine, a nice meal and we're all set.","I think there's a stigma to some degree about the outer boroughs and Jersey, and whether their stories are worth telling.","I really think that the 'Jersey Boys' musical - and this is just my opinion - lends itself to being cinematic in some way, because it's a jukebox musical; the characters break into song only for the scene transitions.","I like to put a little spin on traditional styles as I see them now, probably somewhat inspired by my current job on 'Boardwalk Empire.'","Growing up, I thought wearing a suit was a burden.","I live in N.Y.C. and walk everywhere, so I like stylish shoes that are comfortable.","I've picked up a great appetite for pastrami on rye and nice cream soda. It's fantastic, but I have to be careful, or I'm going to get really fat.","I fell for MUJI socks at their store in N.Y.C.'s JFK airport, and now I get them in bundles.","I don't shop as much as I find.","I think New York style is unique because there's something resourceful about it. Utilitarian. Whereas in Los Angeles, I find people make their cars a day closet. Which, I guess, is resourceful in a different way."],"Vincent Price":["It's as much fun to scare as to be scared.","A man who limits his interests, limits his life."],"Vincent Rodriguez III":["I grew up accepting that my nationality was not depicted on TV or film. To be honest, it was something I didn't acknowledge as a kid. But once I realized my love for acting and the possibility of pursuing a career in it, I quickly noticed the absence of Asians in general and thought, 'Well, I'm gonna try to change that.'","I think this is the most exciting time to be alive right now. We have a black president. There are transgender movies and media out there now. Gay characters are playing non-stereotypical versions of themselves. I feel like as a society, or in television at least, we're rising up. Even in society we're rising up.","I basically learned hip-hop from *NSYNC. And then while I was touring in theater shows, and I couldn't take classes in hip-hop but I wanted to, I just watched Justin Timberlake concerts.","I didn't even drink until I was in college. While other people were out partying, I'd be home watching the Tony Awards and Bob Fosse movies... I so badly wanted to be part of the club.","My dad wanted me to be a businessman, but I felt that wasn't for me.","I booked my first national tour of a Broadway show right out of college. It was the tap show, '42nd Street.' I had only been tap dancing for three years when I booked that show.","I don't believe in rituals that produce luck. I believe that a good preparation can raise my chances for a callback. With that, I know what I need to do, so I go in there and do my best.","Acting takes a lot of practice, but so does auditioning.","We need to encourage the presence of more Asian writers and executive producers so they can fight for normalizing the casting of Asians in traditional American roles.","After a performance, I met the man who would later be my acting coach who helped me get into my acting conservatory. It was apparent to me that there were many others who were in support of me becoming an actor and making a name for myself. I am forever grateful to those teachers and mentors who instead of saying, 'Why you?' said, 'Why not you?'","I was raised in a dominantly Filipino family. I didn't know I was 'mixed' until I got older and started asking questions about my grandparents, the origins of our middle and last names. We were kind of textbook Pinoys. A lot of the Filipino stereotypes that were joked about by me and my friends rang very true with my family.","It's a bummer interracial love is still such a big deal. To me, it's quite normal. I grew up seeing couples that were interracial. Who cares if it's a black guy and white girl, or an Asian guy and white girl, etc.? Odds are, every combo exists out there somewhere so why not put it on the screen? Shouldn't art imitate life?","I was crazy into performing when I was younger. I was obsessed with the craft of acting, and theatre, and stage. You know the term 'theatre geek?' I am the extreme theatre geek.","I can play multiple instruments. I love a cappella. I love barbershop. I love magic.","I wanted a Broadway credit, but 'Crazy Ex' came along, and it blessed me.","The life of an actor is not filled with limousines and talk-show interviews. I've moved crates of beer; I've been a bartender, personal assistant, butler. But all those skills have helped me in the business aspect of what I do.","It's so easy to make an Asian person the doctor, the lawyer, the smart kid in school. What's harder is challenging the norm and hiring Asian actors to play your Average Joe.","Where are the Asian leading men? Well, we're being kicked to the ground; we're not being supported. We're not considered sexy or masculine, this or that. When you start hearing something enough, you start to believe it. But our world is changing, and I think we're starting to see that that's not the end-all be-all."],"Vincent Schiavelli":["My grandfather was a chef for a Baron in Sicily before he came to America. I grew up with him. I used to do my homework at one end of the kitchen table while he cooked at the other end.","You grow up in a Sicilian household, becoming an actor is not a big leap.","My grandparents told endless stories about the town they were from. It became an almost mythic place.","What makes cookbooks interesting is to find out about the people and the culture that invented the food.","I met Milos in 1967. I was working on a student film. And there is Milos Forman. So that's how I met Milos.","Your face is your calling card, but you're not so famous that you can't go out.","I get to meet a lot of people, and I really like people.","The eye condition that I have is Marfan's Syndrome.","I had a wonderful time playing Dr. Kaufman in Tomorrow Never Dies. It was a real Bond villain, over the top, almost laughable but dangerous.","To be a Bond villain, you only get to do that once in your life. You never get to come back.","I shot this wonderful picture called American Saint a couple of years ago, which is still looking for release.","I directed a piece of theater in Italy. We took nine fables from the town and we created a play.","I have a second bedroom I don't use. I'm going to start the Second Bedroom Film Festival. You're all invited."],"Vincent Tan":["In Asia, red is the colour of joy; red is the colour of festivities and of celebration. In Chinese culture, blue is the colour of mourning.","Much as I would like to give out as much as I can, I do recognize that my resources are not unlimited, and therefore, it is imperative that we are able to determine the sustainability and effectiveness of the causes we support. In so doing, we can ensure that our resources are put to the best use.","I wear sunglasses because of the glare of the spotlights. I wear gloves because it is very cold in the U.K.","I love football now. I have a club in Sarajevo, and I love that. The fans are fantastic. The people who run the club are incredible, honest people, and they really motivate me.","We can work together to produce better footballers for both FK Sarajevo and maybe Cardiff City and maybe even to play for other clubs. We hope this will be well received by everybody and enhance good relations between Malaysia and Bosnia.","No matter how much good you do, there will always be a few per cent of people who don't support you.","Sometimes the British press is maybe a little bit racist.","Every business I don't know, if I spend enough time - a couple of months - I will know a lot. I know quite a lot about football now. I know the value of players, and we won't do stupid things.","One day we are a hero, another day we are a zero. Without me, Cardiff would have gone bust. Because of my investment, we got promoted.","You're a hero one day, you're a villain another day. They say that's football. When a manager does well, they're applauded, when they don't do well, they get the sack. Football is a tough world. Those who watch enjoy it - for everybody else, there are a lot of challenges.","I pray Cardiff get back to the Premier League. If I sell Cardiff, I will buy another club in the U.K. I have a club in Sarajevo. The fans are fantastic. The people who run the club are incredible. They really motivate me. I'm looking at another club in Europe and then the MLS.","You look at Man United and Liverpool, and they are red - they are much more successful and have a bigger fan base than Chelsea or Manchester City.","We want to do what is good for Cardiff and for the long-term survival, and hopefully Cardiff can be around for a long time and, God willing, be around in the Premier League.","I started life in a poor family and could not even afford a proper tertiary education.","I started off with making personal donations and eventually set up my own foundation, VTCY Foundation, now known as Better Malaysia Foundation. My contributions are also made through companies that I own.","Due to my business commitments, I am faced with time constraints and have not been able to personally spend as much time as I would like on my causes. These efforts are handled by my team of several people."],"Vincent Van Gogh":["I often think that the night is more alive and more richly colored than the day.","What would life be if we had no courage to attempt anything?","Great things are done by a series of small things brought together.","For my part I know nothing with any certainty, but the sight of the stars makes me dream.","I dream of painting and then I paint my dream.","There is no blue without yellow and without orange.","I put my heart and my soul into my work, and have lost my mind in the process.","There may be a great fire in our hearts, yet no one ever comes to warm himself at it, and the passers-by see only a wisp of smoke.","If you hear a voice within you say 'you cannot paint,' then by all means paint, and that voice will be silenced.","The fishermen know that the sea is dangerous and the storm terrible, but they have never found these dangers sufficient reason for remaining ashore.","Love many things, for therein lies the true strength, and whosoever loves much performs much, and can accomplish much, and what is done in love is done well.","Paintings have a life of their own that derives from the painter's soul.","I feel that there is nothing more truly artistic than to love people.","I wish they would only take me as I am.","I am still far from being what I want to be, but with God's help I shall succeed.","It is better to be high-spirited even though one makes more mistakes, than to be narrow-minded and all too prudent.","As we advance in life it becomes more and more difficult, but in fighting the difficulties the inmost strength of the heart is developed.","Conscience is a man's compass.","Painting is a faith, and it imposes the duty to disregard public opinion.","It is not the language of painters but the language of nature which one should listen to, the feeling for the things themselves, for reality is more important than the feeling for pictures.","Even the knowledge of my own fallibility cannot keep me from making mistakes. Only when I fall do I get up again.","The way to know life is to love many things.","The more I think about it, the more I realize there is nothing more artistic than to love others.","A good picture is equivalent to a good deed.","Love always brings difficulties, that is true, but the good side of it is that it gives energy.","I experience a period of frightening clarity in those moments when nature is so beautiful. I am no longer sure of myself, and the paintings appear as in a dream.","I see drawings and pictures in the poorest of huts and the dirtiest of corners.","But I always think that the best way to know God is to love many things.","In spite of everything I shall rise again: I will take up my pencil, which I have forsaken in my great discouragement, and I will go on with my drawing.","One must work and dare if one really wants to live.","Poetry surrounds us everywhere, but putting it on paper is, alas, not so easy as looking at it.","One may have a blazing hearth in one's soul and yet no one ever came to sit by it. Passers-by see only a wisp of smoke from the chimney and continue on their way.","If one is master of one thing and understands one thing well, one has at the same time, insight into and understanding of many things.","Do not quench your inspiration and your imagination; do not become the slave of your model.","I can very well do without God both in my life and in my painting, but I cannot, suffering as I am, do without something which is greater than I am, which is my life, the power to create.","How can I be useful, of what service can I be? There is something inside me, what can it be?","When I have a terrible need of - shall I say the word - religion. Then I go out and paint the stars.","An artist needn't be a clergyman or a churchwarden, but he certainly must have a warm heart for his fellow men.","If boyhood and youth are but vanity, must it not be our ambition to become men?","The best way to know God is to love many things.","Those Dutchmen had hardly any imagination or fantasy, but their good taste and their scientific knowledge of composition were enormous."],"Vincente Minnelli":["Color can do anything that black-and-white can.","I learn new things all the time.","The Pirate is surrealism and so, in a curious way, is Father of the Bride.","I use colors to bring fine points of story and character.","Nowadays the audience has changed. No one can anticipate the audience.","American films are terribly popular all over the world and American movie stars are terribly important. I don't know why.","I seem to be drawn to things that actually happen.","It's always the story that interests me.","I allow an area for improvisation because the chemical things actors bring to stories make it not work.","In the Thirties, when I was in New York, I did the first surrealistic ballet in a show of mine.","If anybody reads a story in a magazine or book, different pictures compete in their minds.","I started out to be a painter and was born into the theater.","I had given up the theater and everything propelled me into entertainment. And I didn't resist it.","No, I only like whether I like the story or not, essentially see something in it that isn't completely there.","It's the story that counts.","Designing Woman was written for the screen.","But surrealism is present in most of my pictures.","I always have coffee without sugar, you know. Just cream.","Fortunately, John Houseman is a marvelous writer and he sat in on so many story conferences. He worked with Welles, you know, and he's a marvelous man.","Dali was the great painter then and surrealism was a way of life.","Cedric Gibbons was the grand cardinal of the art department.","But I went down to Venezuela and spend a few weeks going through jungles. It's fantastic looking.","I always liked the Van Gogh story because I was terribly involved in that.","We shot that in all the real places where Van Gogh worked.","I've worked with an awful lot of people. Katy Hepburn, Spencer Tracy.","I made three films with Douglas, two with Charles Boyer.","I see wonderful films by Bertolucci, Visconti, and Fellini.","But I think musicals are going to have to deal with important subjects.","West Side Story was terribly important because of the style of the dancing and the gangs of New York.","That's what I think musicals will come to. No backstage stories, nothing of that sort."],"Vine Deloria, Jr.":["Western civilization, unfortunately, does not link knowledge and morality but rather, it connects knowledge and power and makes them equivalent.","When asked by an anthropologist what the Indians called America before the white man came, an Indian said simply, 'Ours.'"],"Vinessa Shaw":["Coming to know one another based on a shared humanity through dialogue is the key to breaking down the walls of isolation and reversing the decline of life-to-life bonds among human beings.","I believe that dialogue is the key to breaking through our tendency to separate and isolate. Dialogue changes isolation and loneliness into connection and interdependence. This, I believe, is the essence of Buddhism.","When I realized that nothing is perfect and no one is perfect, I was able to overcome my initial fears. I was holding myself to some weird standard that I was putting outside of myself, i.e., the director or casting director - they're not expecting perfection. I had all these strange trappings I would put myself in.","I was going to school thinking I was going to do something entirely different, thought acting was just a hobby at that point, met Stanley Kubrick and was like, 'Whoa, this can be an art form, and you can really move people the way you do simply by acting.'","I think all of the directors I've worked with are mostly curious about the time I had on 'Eyes Wide Shut.' They really just want to know about it. They're all fans of Kubrick.","I'm not very good at dating. I'm very decisive. If I like someone, then they're my boyfriend. It's pretty straightforward.","I think all movie love scenes are hard because you can't truly be as intimate as you would be with anyone you're truly with, and everyone's watching you.","I'm a Buddhist and active in my Buddhist's Association, and I'm actually a National Young Women's representative for the organization, so I travel a lot helping young women who are practicing Buddhism.","It's such an awkward, strange thing that was concocted, to have auditions. Back in the old days, you'd just have a screen test, and they'd say, 'Oh, you seem natural in front of the camera,' and you'd just go do 10 pictures for Paramount or whatever.","I had done the child acting thing, which is pretty much learning your lines, standing there looking natural, and having fun.","My grandmother is still a woman who worries about what she looks like when she goes outside. She's from that era, and I can remember saying to her, 'Grandmother, we're just going to the grocery store.' And she'd be like, 'I've got to fix my face!' You were very aware of how you were presenting yourself to society in 1960s Las Vegas.","When you practice Buddhism, you have to always self-reflect, and you can't avoid your problems. That makes me understand human beings better. I feel that the more I do that in my own life, the more I can see how to play a character.","In 'Garden Party' or '40 Days and 40 Nights,' I played characters who people don't necessarily like; I just find some humanity in them.","My dad's a surfer-psychologist, and my mother's an actress-fitness instructor, and we all practice Buddhism.","How many Buddhists does it take to change a lightbulb? Many in body, one in mind.","Anywhere in the world, any day of the week, in 192 countries and territories worldwide, one can find an SGI Buddhist meeting where dialogue is at the fore.","The compassionate actions of a Buddha are essential to reforming and revitalizing society."],"Ving Rhames":["I live a very simple life.","The more you do a stunt, the more you increase the risk of something happening.","Since God is the foundation of my life, anything that streams from that can only be positive.","I was more interested in playing sports than acting. I didn't take acting too seriously until the end of my junior year.","I don't need dialogue to convey emotion or thoughts to my audience.","If someone's intimidated by me, that's something they have to deal with. When I walk down the streets of New York and an old woman grabs her purse when I pass by, I'm not going to give it a whole lot of energy because I'm not in the wrong. I'm a millionaire, and I'm not thinking about grabbing an old woman's purse.","God has blessed me with a certain amount of presence and a certain amount of charisma.","Quite honestly I never had a desire to be an actor. I tell people, I did not choose acting; acting chose me. I never grew up wanting to be an actor. I wanted to play football. In about 9th grade an English teacher told me I had a talent to act. He said I should audition for a performing arts high school so I did on a whim. I got accepted.","I think quite a bit of organized religion has become big business. Jesus Christ never sold the word of God. He never gave a sermon and then said, 'For $8.99, you can buy the CD.'","Really, if you get in the ring and box with someone for real, I don't think it is a sport. As far as professional fighters, you are literally putting your life on the line.","Snorkeling the Great Barrier Reef, I saw something - I don't know what it was to this day. My mind couldn't relate to what it was... If I saw it and knew it was a shark, I wouldn't be as afraid, but I saw something that looked prehistoric, and I haven't been snorkeling since.","I grew up in Harlem, and the kids used to tease me. You know that song 'Bingo'? Well, they used to sing, 'V-i-n-g-o, and Vingo was his name-o.'","You get Don King's point of view in what is almost a Shakespearean, classical technique. He comes across almost like a lovable rogue, like Iago in 'Othello' or Richard III. He's doing all these bad things, but I kind of like him. It's like 'Pulp Fiction': Everybody's a bad guy, yet you like them.","Are you intimidated by me? Because if you're intimidated by me, that's something you'll have to deal with.","For me, acting was a way of releasing all of this stuff that I had inside - and a way for me to tell the stories of the people I knew, so that their spirit could live through me.","I like to say that I didn't choose acting - acting chose me.","I saw how, when my brother smoked reefer, it made my mother cry. He was 16 at the time. And I saw that she broke down and cried. I never wanted to hurt my mother, so I kept away from drugs.","You don't have to make, you know, $3 Million dollars a movie, or $20 Million dollars a movie, but if you make a living doing what you love doing, then that's success to me.","I grew up in a poverty-stricken neighborhood, but I didn't really know I was a deprived, poverty-stricken child until the media made me aware of it.","I don't give Hollywood the power to limit me. Only God can limit me.","I was never a struggling actor, for which I feel very blessed.","The only difference between working on a huge-budget film and a lesser-budget film, is the quality of lunch and dinner.","My approach to the work is the same, whether I had the lead or a supporting role. I consider myself a character actor in the true sense of the word. Unless I'm doing my autobiography, I'm playing a character.","'Mission: Impossible' is basically entertainment, and for what it is, it's fine. I don't think most actors become actors to do that type of film.","Quite honestly I never had a desire to be an actor. I tell people, 'I did not choose acting; acting chose me.' I never grew up wanting to be an actor. I wanted to play football.","In about 9th grade, an English teacher told me I had a talent to act. He said I should audition for a performing arts high school, so I did on a whim. I got accepted. Then I got accepted at the Julliard School, and by then, I was serious about it.","I think God has blessed each of us with at least one gift. So I think it's a matter of do we find it within our lifetime.","Since I graduated college, all I have ever done for a living was acting.","People often think I've played the villain more times than I have.","The character of the computer whiz is not one that would normally be associated with me.","When I look at the world, I recognize that unfortunately, it sometimes takes an atrocity like 9/11 to force us to come together.","The more versatile you make yourself, the more work you get. Training makes you more versatile and ultimately gets you more work. Julliard taught me that.","Most American actors are taught the Stanislavsky method... Method acting, but I really think that as an actor you have to develop what works for you. There is really not one way of doing anything. There are many ways of achieving the same goal.","I find early jazz to be the most revolutionary music of its time.","You can feel I am whatever you want to feel I am. God knows who I am, and I know who I am.","In this industry, very few actors can control their career.","I graduated college in 1983, so that's 32 years, and all I've done for a living is act or commercials or voiceovers. So I have nothing to complain about.","I'm the spokesman for ADT, and ADT, brother, pays better than most actors make on film.","The training at Juilliard School is classical training, and it really makes one very versatile.","I never grew up thinking I wanted to be a quote-unquote star or anything. My thing was just feeling blessed to be able to make my living acting.","I'm from New York, and yet I've done only one film executive-produced by Spike Lee and have never done a film that Spike Lee directed. I've never done a film that Keenan Wayans has directed, or Bill Duke.","I've always been taught to just play the truth of the situation. If comedy comes out of that, or drama, whatever comes out of it, at least I'm playing the truth of the moment-to-moment reality.","I've known Laurence Fishburne for about twenty years.","When I think of the trials and tribulations that black men go through in America and that black artists went through, I feel very privileged.","My dogs are family dogs.","I really feel that there are things in the ocean that we have no idea about.","I think there's so much we don't know and the unknown in the ocean; every 10 years or so, we find some fossil that's been there before mankind.","I do fish, and as a matter of fact, I used to do a lot of deep sea fishing, but as far as going into the water, I don't go out deep into the water.","My wife is a former homicide detective, LAPD. The wonderful thing that I was able to capture is my wife's experiences from human and professional, and how do you deal with some of the atrocities that happen in L.A. and not bring them home.","How do you cut off the human side and just maintain being professional? So what I've done is I've incorporated that with Kojak - there's times when he allows the human condition, the human experience, to integrate into him as a professional.","There's really not that much difference between you and I. And my name really doesn't matter. Hopefully, my heart and my spirit matters to you. Hopefully.","I saw that crime pays, but I never got involved in crime.","Miss Goodblatt would call on me to read. She said I had a talent. So on a whim, I auditioned for the High School of Performing Arts in Manhattan.","I graduated on a Friday. By Monday, I was doing Shakespeare in the Park.","I try to allow the spirit of the character to live through me. That's the only way I know how to approach acting. I have to live it.","A lot of times, scripts are written so the character is all one way. Even with 'Bringing Out the Dead,' the character was written a little more generic.","My brother and I slept on the couch. I didn't get my own room until I was in college. We didn't even have a telephone until I was in college.","I don't know if I hadn't grown up poor, and in the neighborhood I did, if I would have had that much to bring to my art form. I call upon my past with characters.","I find it so strange that I throw people off-center.","Rosewood is what Americans did to Americans. We have to hold the mirror up... and look at ourselves. Sometimes that's an ugly sight. And sometimes you have to go through that pain - both black America and white America - so we can finally find some racial harmony.","Rottweilers are victims of a stereotype. They're not that bad.","I've always been interested in cross-cultural exchange with the youth.","I grew up in Harlem in New York, very rough, urban environment, and so what I found is that, if I can have kids travel to different places, countries, areas, it can expand their minds.","We're all about trying to teach the kids life through basketball.","Entertainment is needed, and so I do think escapism is needed.","'Mission: Impossible' is fun. But for myself as an artist, I'm really more concerned with the human condition, the human experience, especially from an African American point of view.","It's really how you deal with people. Do people respect you? Are you honest with people even if it's something they don't want to hear? Anyone in Hollywood will tell you I'm extremely up front and honest almost to a fault.","There could be some unknown actor who's a better actor than Ving Rhames, but no one knows that actor, so Ving Rhames will get the job.","God is putting me in a position to affect people.","I can always do theater; I can do Ibsen, I can do Macbeth, I can do Chekhov, I can do Moliere, Othello, I can do Richard III.","Using the Africanist model, each generation should take the family name to a higher place. My father's folks were sharecroppers in South Carolina. He went to Harlem. They were still poor, but they moved up. If my parents didn't do this and offer me this background, I wouldn't be here.","I spent three days with Don King, and I interviewed 45 people. I studied his speech, his mannerisms. He invited me to a couple of fights, and I watched him.","Don King is as American as apple pie. He is America.","I try to base my life on the principles of Christ. I try to raise my family on the principles of Christ. I don't know if that makes me religious.","I'm a God-fearing man, and I know the only reason why I am here going from poverty to where I am now is God has His hand on my life. I tell people, 'I didn't choose acting; God chose me to act.'","All I want and all I even ask of people in Hollywood is look, just be honest with me. Please don't lie to me. Whatever the situation is, be honest with me."],"Vinnie Jones":["I've always had my ear pierced with a diamond stud. I did it myself when I was 16.","My parents split when I was 13. For a youngster, it's quite devastating. One minute you're all happy families, then everything changes.","I signed schoolboy forms for Watford when I was 12, but then my parents got divorced, and I never kicked a ball for three years. I rebelled, I left home, but getting back into football sorted me out. It was the second chance I needed.","There's good action stars. I'm a bad-guy action star. What disappoints me is when you all of a sudden you get a good action star and then he wants to play a comedy with kids, you know? That upsets me, and that's not being true to your fans.","My mum calls my temper 'Devilman.' They say you calm down with age, but I don't know. It never goes away.","In 'Hell Ride,' I play a biker - it's about the bikers. It's with Dennis Hopper and Michael Madsen, Larry Bishop and myself. We're bikers, and I play Billy Wings; I've got all sorts of wings, and you have to watch the movie to find out what the wings are about.","I've always felt that people put me down, and I'd fight back. I played football 15 years, and nobody gave me any credit, and they never will do.","I'm a Conservative, but I talk for the ordinary working classes. I get on with the boys at the pub, but I can also mix with Prince Andrew. I understand both levels. The toffs haven't lived in council estates; they've just known big mansions. How can they understand how the postman feels? I would never say no to becoming an MP.","Film is like football - you join a team, get close to one or two people, then never hear from them again. I don't get emotionally involved. Do one, move on.","Football became my life at five or six. The earliest memory I have is of playing in my first boots, a pair of black and white Alan Balls. It was 1970, four years after the World Cup, and I scored three goals at school.","I buy hats like women buy shoes. I have well over 150.","I'm lucky in that I travel a lot for work. I also manage several holidays a year. I'm not someone who sits in the sun or goes sightseeing, though. If I go away, it will be for fishing or something like that.","I like Alaska for the salmon fishing - it's fantastic there. I usually stay in a log cabin with no one around for miles. I like to go with friends, but I'm also happy to be on my own with nature.","I always went to Ireland as a child. I remember trips to Dundalk, Wexford, Cork and Dublin. My gran was born in Dublin, and we had a lot of Irish friends, so we'd stay on their farms and go fishing. They were fantastic holidays - being outdoors all day and coming home to a really warm welcome in the evenings.","I'd like to be the romantic lead one day, but I've got to grow my hair first.","For years in football I was angry with the game, angry with pundits and, a lot of the time, angry with the journalists writing about me. All that changed when I got my break in movies.","I've got the FA Cup tattooed on my leg and the Leeds United emblem, too. On my back, I've got, 'It's been emotional,' which is my line from 'Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels.' I'm fond of my tattoos, and I'm still having more.","Over the years, I've had about 80 stitches in my head and face from football incidents and bar incidents, so I have lots of scars. I don't think I look intimidating, but I'm sure other people have their opinions.","When two people break up, it's all about them; they can't see anyone else. And the people getting smashed to bits are the kids. Then you're getting torn - your mum wants you, your dad wants you. You just get shredded. It has a long-lasting effect as well.","For some people, becoming a parent does change them, but it never changed me.","People say you can get bored of the sunshine in L.A. No, you can't.","The likes of Frank Lampard and John Terry at Chelsea, English players with proper status at a club, they're going to be like the dodo bird. Extinct.","People say, 'I love 'Snatch,' I love 'Lock Stock,' but I want to be more than a movie name. I'd love to be more of a household name.","We all carry our past. But it is a case of getting on with your life and improving it, if you want to.","Americans don't care what your language is, your race is, whatever. Everyone is there to do their own thing and be successful. I wish people in Britain would be more positive.","I was captain of Wales; I've been captain of numerous football clubs.","Look at me - I was the boo boy for years and years. Did I ever think I would end up in Hollywood or the FA Cup final? No, I didn't.","After 'Big Brother,' people came up to me in the street shouting, 'You woz robbed!'","I was offered 'I'm A Celebrity...' for a lot of money, but I don't like the level of degradation.","There are a few YouTube clips of me singing at The King's Head in Santa Monica, so you can see how bad I am.","I always want to try new things, and 'Mean Machine' has given me that chance. I have got plans to carry on acting and would love to play all sorts of roles - you'll see that there's more strings to my bow!","John Wayne never ever disappointed his fans, because he was a cowboy.","I do my independent stuff where it's real acting if you like. Intense, drama stuff. I love me actions.","To me, England is past its sell-by date. It's not the country I grew up in.","Awareness about heart disease has got to be raised."],"Vinnie Vincent":["I have no plan to retire anytime soon, although remember I am 50 years old!","I also plan to release a ballads collection.","I hope to find the perfect band as well, I really do, and I'm working very hard to find that band.","I agree with you about the music of today. It lacks style and emotion.","I miss the 80's as well, it was a truly great decade for music.","In my opinion I do not think I am a better guitarist than Ace, I honestly think we're both different, and we both brought something unique to the musical.","Soon I will be doing what I love again."],"Vinny Guadagnino":["For me, it's all about the haircut. I don't have a lot of hair to style, so I keep it nice and fresh and tight. I actually go to the barbershop every five days. As soon as your haircut is on point, you have to make sure your outfit is fully ironed, you smell good, and you have clean sneakers on. Pretty much the head-to-toe look.","Partying isn't every aspect to my personality.","I like to be dressy casual. I wear jeans and nice sneakers. I wear nice clothes, but not super dressed up. I don't wear too much jewelry. I keep it simple and maybe wear just a little chain.","So, I remember when I was a kid, I was waiting for my mom to come home when she was working late, and, you know, I was like, 'Oh my God, what happened to her? Is she OK? Did something happen to her getting in the car?' I was a little kid. But those are actually early onsets of anxiety.","My house has always been like everyone's house. You walk in, you're a part of the family, no matter who you are, what celebrity status you are, everyone is treated the same - with love from my mom.","People think for Shakespeare you have to have a big English accent, but it's not true. He designed it so it can be performed in any accent in any time period.","My family was all born in Sicily and I'm Italian-American. They're the real thing. They're authentic Italians, and honestly they're the most open-minded, nicest people in the world and nothing can really offend them. That's the way I think true Sicilians are.","It helps me when I help people.","I am fascinated by quantum physics.","I can work myself up into a fearful, paralyzing state of mind that can last for days, weeks even months where I feel mad, totally isolated and alone, overwhelmed and completely out of control.","Anxiety is a natural thing humans have. You know, that's how we evolve. That's how we are, you know, we think things through. Sometimes my mind just thinks things through a lot.","I don't care who you are, but you turn into a different person when you don't sleep.","I was a huge Spice Girls fan when I was a kid. When I was younger I had a Spice Girls poster on my wall and I watched the movie.","The root of the problem I have is anxiety, and it's all derived from something - I'm just going to say it, some kind of sadness. It manifests in so many different ways and it affects people differently.","When I look for self-help books for myself, I used to be scared that I was going to pick up a book that would depress me even more.","I've always been more natural at doing hosting things: reading teleprompters, taking direction and asking questions... I'm actually able to perform a little bit.","My mom's gonna be the biggest star - mark my words right now!","I look up to Jimmy Fallon. He hosts talk shows as a fan himself, and that's how I do it. When the celebrities come in, I'm excited that they're there. It's not just like a formal, 'Hey, how are ya?' It's like, 'Dude, what the hell! So happy to see you!' That's what Jimmy Fallon does every time.","My mother's my biggest supporter.","You never really see me acting a fool on TV.","I've always been in school plays and performing monologues and taking drama. Now I'm in acting classes. I do it the real way. I want to be a working actor. I would love that. I just like being on a series and having a script, and I want that to be my nine-to-five.","I graduated from CUNY College of Staten Island with a 3.9 GPA in three and a half years.","I enjoy painting and can copy almost anything.","I took the LSAT the day 'Jersey Shore' premiered, and after that I was too busy to go to law school.","I have been doing acting my whole life. I did plays in high school. I take it pretty seriously. I used to do a lot of Shakespeare and Shakespearean festivals and monologues.","I made my drama teacher cry. I only took drama to get out of writing papers in English and the teacher was this thespian Broadway geek and here I was this Italian guy from Staten Island and I would put her in tears.","I would love a recurring role on '90210.' I would say yes to just about any role in acting that doesn't tarnish my image.","I was always the lead role in plays. I like entertaining people. I like when you're on stage doing crazy stuff and the audience gets it.","I'm an artistic kind of person. I draw. I've drawn my whole life. When you have an imaginative mind, I think the artistic form manifests itself in different ways. When I was younger, I used to draw murals for people.","I take improv classes. Improv is something I can use in any aspect of life.","All celebrities are real people behind everything.","I keep it real normal, like I don't try to act like a celebrity, or say that just because I'm on a TV show I can do other types of TV. I take it very seriously and I respect the art of acting.","I'm definitely suspicious of girls. I've been suspicious of girls my whole life, though, so it's not anything new.","Well, I definitely have an artistic side to me as well. I write, I act, I draw. With that artistic mind I have, a lot of doors have opened for me. I can try to pursue, like - if it's something using my writing skills, maybe a book. Or maybe if it's my drawing skills, some clothing designs.","My political science degree is always on the back-burner. I took my LSAT, so even if I want to take the LSAT again, I know what I'm getting into. I'll keep it on the back-burner. Who knows, maybe with my popularity, I can have a career in politics with a law degree. I think it'll work out either way.","I've been drawing since I was a little kid, but it's not something I love to do every day. If there's one thing I love to do every day, it'd probably be acting. I can act every day. I'd happily do it, you don't have to pay me. But that's one thing I'd love to do and get paid for.","I took the LSAT. My score was decent. I had a plan that if my score was really well, then I might of just went to Yale or Harvard... But it was just mediocre. I can get into law school.","Nobody wants to be a lawyer - it's hard work. But it was kind of my academic route.","I think people can have a panic attack where your heart is racing, you get shakes and jitters. But you can also feel disconnected. You know what I mean? I can feel depressed.","I'm in my best shape when I'm really anxious, because I have to get to the gym. Physically I'm in the best shape.","I got a family house for everybody to live in - my mom, my sisters and I. And I made sure that it has a separate apartment downstairs for myself. Family is more important than anything. We don't come from any money. So once I get them settled in, in a nice house, then I'll branch out and see if I can get something else."],"Vinny Testaverde":["First you have to spread on the rust performer, then you add a coat of protective enamel, and then you spray on the satin finish so you look good.","I'm excited, happy, nervous, anxious, all those feelings about playing for the Jets again. If I didn't have high expectations, I wouldn't come back here.","When I came back, I wasn't looking past this year. This is a bonus for me. I just wish it would have turned out a little better, but we all don't get what we want all the time.","When you're on the road, you have to be louder and you have to communicate. That's really the bottom line.","Back in the '80s and '90s, you could hit the quarterback low, you could hit the quarterback high. You could hit him pretty much late.","I think you have regrets when you didn't give it everything you had, and I always felt like I did. Whether it was good enough or not, that has nothing to do with the fact that I tried my best to give my team a chance to win, year in and year out.","My biggest hobby is playing golf, which I really enjoy. Now when I am lying in bed at night, unable to sleep, I find myself thinking about my golf swing. I'm also involved in the Tampa Bay chapter of First Tee.","Football is about winning; it's that simple. You have to love what you do. If you're here for the money, than you don't belong here."],"Vinoba Bhave":["Life does not mean mere karma or mere bhakti or mere jnana.","The river flows at its own sweet will, but the flood is bound in the two banks. If it were not thus bound, its freedom would be wasted.","It is a curious phenomena that God has made the hearts of the poor, rich and those of the rich, poor.","We cannot fight new wars with old weapons.","When a thing is true, there is no need to use any arguments to substantiate it.","The natural movement of one's soul is upwards. But just as any object is dragged down when a heavy weight is tied to it, the burden of the body drags down the soul.","A country should be defended not by arms, but by ethical behavior.","A sword in hand is a sure sign of a violent mind; but one does not become non-violent merely by throwing the sword away.","If a man achieves victory over this body, who in the world can exercise power over him? He who rules himself rules over the whole world.","In the Bhagavad Gita, there is no long discussion, nothing elaborate. The main reason for this is that everything stated in the Gita is meant to be tested in the life of every man; it is intended to be verified in practice.","God guides us from within. He does nothing more than that. There is no charm in God shaping us like a potter. We are not earthen wares; we are beings full of consciousness.","I may worship the image of the Lord; but that act is worthless if it is not accompanied with devotion. In the absence of devotion, the idol will just be a piece of stone, and so shall I; and the worship will only mean that a stone is facing a stone!","The main reason why we look constantly to the Gita is that, whenever we need help, we may get it from the Gita. And, indeed, we always do get it.","In nonviolence you must go full steam ahead, if you want the good to come speedily you must go about it with vigor.","All revolutions are spiritual at the source. All my activities have the sole purpose of achieving a union of hearts.","Do not allow yourself to imagine that revolutionary thinking can be propagated by governmental power.","Human life is full of the play of samskaras - tendencies developed by repeated actions.","Innumerable actions are going on through us all the time. If we started counting them, we should never come to an end.","We cannot even recollect the actions of our infancy, our childhood is like something written on a slate and rubbed off.","Though the names karma yoga and sannyasa are different, the truth at the heart of both is the same.","If we could only snap the fetters of the body that bind the feet of the soul, we shall experience a great joy. Then we shall not be miserable because of the body's sufferings. We shall become free.","If we wish our nature to be free and joyous, we should bring our activities into same order.","It is only when our life proceeds within bounds and in an accepted, disciplined way, that the mind can be free.","We have seen from experience that, if we are in the habit of walking regularly on the same road, we are able to think about other things while walking, without paying attention to our steps.","In this world of chance and change and mutability, the fulfillment of any resolve depends on the will of the Lord.","'Talks on the Gita' is the story of my life, and it is also my message."],"Vinod Khosla":["Electric cars are coal-powered cars. Their carbon emissions can be worse than gasoline-powered cars.","Germany has a lot of solar power. In fact, in 2005, some 55 or 57 percent of worldwide installations were photovoltaics in Germany. That's 57 percent of all worldwide solar photovoltaics. Because of the high feed-in tariff, they have a way of allowing you to produce electricity and ship it into the grid at very high prices.","The probability of failure doesn't matter to me.","You know, one of the great things about most renewable technologies - not every technology, but many of them - is the jobs have to be local. When you're talking about a power plant and power generation using solar thermal technology, the jobs will be where the plant is.","Seeking an acquisition from the start is more than just bad advice for an entrepreneur. For the entrepreneur it leads to short term tactical decisions rather than company-building decisions and in my view often reduces the probability of success.","If you have a carbon cap and trade system, there'd be an agreed-to limit the amount of carbon we emit. That changes the economic picture for fossil technologies and for the renewable technologies. It makes the renewable technologies more attractive and the fossils less attractive.","I don't believe - till something radical changes that we are not on track to do - that hybrids are material to climate change. They're fashionable, everybody loves them, the Prius is selling well, but so are Gucci bags. But they don't impact the way the world carries stuff. You know it's a fashion statement.","I don't know a startup that hasn't been through tough times.","The only way you multiply resources is with technology. To really affect poverty, energy, health, education, or anything else - there is no other way.","In my view, it's irreverence, foolish confidence and naivety combined with persistence, open mindedness and a continual ability to learn that created Facebook, Google, Yahoo, eBay, Microsoft, Apple, Juniper, AOL, Sun Microsystems and others.","Knowing whose advice to take and on what topic is the single most important decision an entrepreneur can make.","Religion asks you to believe things without questioning, and technology and science always encourage you to ask hard questions and why it is important in science and technology. So I was always interested in science and technology.","Startups allow technologists and scientists to take risks and change plans in a way that would be frowned upon in a big company. Having said that, big companies will play a key role in certain areas and in partnerships with little companies. Each has its strengths.","Entrepreneurs can benefit a lot from the right help and advice, and you can avoid costly mistakes. You can get incredible leverage in hiring people who wouldn't even talk to you if you have the right help. An investor isn't about money - it's about the help and advice you can get.","My life is full of way more mistakes than successes.","Environmentalists get in the way. They often ask the right questions, but they're chasing the wrong answers - often hypothetical or uneconomic solutions.","I'm very excited by biomass and biofuels. We have a company, KiOR, that turns biomass - for instance, wood chips - into gasoline. The potential value of this company is huge. It could compete with regular crude oil without subsidies.","The combination of brilliant ideas and entrepreneurial spirit should lead us to a safer and more secure future.","Venture-capital firms invest in trends by projecting returns. But most projections are pretty much bogus, and research shows that experts are no better at predicting the future than dart-throwing monkeys.","I believe a board in a small startup company should never vote on anything.","I generally disagree with most of the very high margin opportunities. Why? Because it's a business strategy tradeoff: the lower the margin you take, the faster you grow.","The winter period between September and March in this country, when land sits fallow and is subject to topsoil loss, we could be enriching the soil and growing all the biomass we need to replace imported gasoline.","We like to say at Khosla Ventures, and this is one of the reasons to do what we do, we'll take technical risks that nobody else will.","Now it will take a long time to scale biofuels, but I'm the only one in the world forecasting oil dropping in price to $35 a barrel by 2030. I'll put it on the record: Oil will not be able to compete with cellulosic biofuels. If you do it from food, the food will get so expensive you can't make fuel out of it.","Certain food-based biofuels like biodiesel have always been a bad idea. Others like corn ethanol have served a useful purpose and essentially are obsoleting themselves.","I'm not a political person. I'm a techie nerd, and I enjoy the techie part. I mean, all my life, I've loved great technology.","The U.S. has fallen well behind Europe in recognizing climate change and the implications of climate change.","There are parts of the country in America, in the Midwest, where wind is a big resource, and we should absolutely use it. But to try and apply it nationally doesn't make sense. There are technologies that will work that are appropriate to certain regions.","Is it 10 years, 20, 50 before we reach that tipping point where climate change becomes irreversible? Nobody can know. There's clearly a probability distribution. We need to ensure this planet, and we need to do it quickly.","I do not know what got me interested in technology. What was very clear to me very early on was that I was not interested in religion and that naturally increased my curiosity about science and technology, and I fundamentally believe the two are conflicting.","Everybody else is afraid to fail. I do not really care because when I fail, I try something new.","If I collected all the diamonds in the world, I'd have no 'income' but I'd have a lot of 'assets'. Would my company be worth nothing because I have no income? A lot of Net companies are collecting assets. They have to be measured with a new set of metrics.","What an entrepreneur does is to build for the long run. If the market is great, you get all of the resources you can. You build to it. But a good entrepreneur is always prepared to throttle back, put on the brakes, and if the world changes, adapt to the world.","I've probably failed more often than anybody else in Silicon Valley. Those don't matter. I don't remember the failures. You remember the big successes.","Imagine the world of mobile based on Nokia and Motorola if Apple had not been restarted by a missionary entrepreneur named Steve Jobs who cared more for his vision than being tactical and financial.","If everyone played it safe, we wouldn't get anywhere.","I'm a fiscal hawk. I vote against all taxes, but I do believe the environment, and climate change, is a bigger issue than fiscal deficits are as a risk to the nation.","Entrepreneurs have the flexibility and the ability to do things that large companies simply cannot. Could a large company pull off a trick like Amyris, going from anti-malaria medicine to next-generation fuel?","Will biofuel usage require land? Absolutely, but we think the ability to use winter cover crops, degraded land, as well as using sources such as organic waste, sewage, and forest waste means that actual land usage will be limited. Just these sources can replace most of our imported oil by 2030 without touching new land.","First, you should take money and have plenty of money fueling your tank. But money becomes dangerous if you assume it's going to keep coming. Make sure you can get your burn rate to a sustainable level if you hit the brakes hard, within 90 days.","Who cares if companies are overvalued or not?","When I started doing things on my own, I was figuring - remember, it was a very nascent market. And there was a lot that was unknown about the renewable marketplace in 2004, early 2003, when I was planning on it.","We love serious technology innovations, and there is a strong bias towards large technology innovations that are sort of disruptive to the current market.","You take something like RingCentral. It doesn't need any more money or financing: it is relatively mature, recurring revenue business - not really worried - but you know, we could sell it tomorrow. We have not been in a rush to sell it. We don't care about exits as much. We care about building fundamental value.","Our focus is not on exit. In fact if you talk to any of my entrepreneurs, I'm generally saying, 'Don't sell the company,' when other investors want to sell. I'd much rather focus on building long-term value in building companies rather than worrying about exits.","Photovoltaics are a great technology for certain applications, and, in fact, we invest in photovoltaic technologies. But they're not good substitutes for grid electricity.","There's a big difference between needs and requirements for grid-based electricity versus those for distributed rural homes or remote locations, or even rooftop solar, where photovoltaics do OK. The more economical a technology is, the faster we'll see adoption.","The bulk of the utility industry today believes that coal and nuclear are the only solutions we have. Nuclear is greener but has the other issues. Coal, they think, can be transformed into the so-called clean coal technologies.","Eighty percent of what doctors do, tech can do at a fraction of the cost - especially your rural doctor in India.","I challenge anybody to claim that clean tech done right is a disaster.","Hopefully, I can advise entrepreneurs to avoid mistakes. But you can never be sure if you're trying something new and unreasonable.","I've failed at more things than anyone I know. No one remembers the failures.","Your willingness to fail is what will let you succeed.","Nobody who comes in once every six weeks while you're working 80 or 90 hours a week is qualified to make a decision.","People over 45 basically die in terms of new ideas.","One thing about technology is that there's always a win, place, and show, and everyone else goes under.","New industries are created by entrepreneurs who don't necessarily have subject matter expertise when they get started, yet they are still responsible for most of the innovation we see in society.","Did Google know much about media? Or Amazon about commerce? Tesla about cars? SpaceX about rockets? EBay about classifieds? What did I know about computing when I started Sun Microsystems? We should celebrate these entrepreneurs, not pillory them for fighting entrenched incumbent industries that have political influence and money."],"Vint Cerf":["Information flow is what the Internet is about. Information sharing is power. If you don't share your ideas, smart people can't do anything about them, and you'll remain anonymous and powerless.","The net's future is far from assured, and history offers much warning. Within a few decades of Gutenberg's creation, princes and priests moved to restrict the right to print books.","It's the Industrial Revolution and the growth of urban concentrations that led to a sense of anonymity.","There was something amazingly enticing about programming.","Instant messaging and chat rooms have basically created a level playing field for deaf people.","I wore a coat and tie all through high school: my way of being rebellious in the late 1950s.","Yet in all those cases I finally steeled myself to seize the opportunity, and find a way to muddle through and eventually conclude that I had, in fact, chosen the right path, as risky as it seemed at the time.","What is special about VOIP is that it's just another thing you can do on the Internet, whereas it is the only thing - or nearly the only thing with the exception of the dial-up modem and fax - that you can do on the public switched telephone network.","In 1970, there was a single telephone company in the United States called AT&T, and its technology was called circuit switching, and that was all any telecom engineer worried about.","The Internet is literally a network of networks.","The Internet lives where anyone can access it.","The idea that you can somehow erase the Internet is silly.","At some point, you can't lift this boulder with just your own strength. And if you find that you need to move bigger and bigger boulders up hills, you will need more and more help.","The computer would do anything you programmed it to do.","My reaction to a lot of the current situation that we're in is based in part on a serious concern that the present administration's course ignores reality.","Yet we still see continuous reports of bugs.","You don't have to be young to learn about technology. You have to feel young.","There's nothing special about wireless networks except that wireless capacity is sometimes less than what you can get, for example, from optical fiber.","Energy, health care and education are just three examples of areas in which information and information management are critically important. How are we using our energy? What appliances in homes or business are consuming the most energy? When do they consume it? Can the load be shifted? How efficient are these devices?","Free is not going to go away. Either the advertising model will still work, or there will still be literally hundreds of millions of people who want to put their information on the Net and want people to have access to it.","There is a high bar for something to be considered a human right. Loosely put, it must be among the things we as humans need in order to lead healthy, meaningful lives, like freedom from torture or freedom of conscience.","The Internet has introduced an enormously accessible and egalitarian platform for creating, sharing and obtaining information on a global scale. As a result, we have new ways to allow people to exercise their human and civil rights.","Improving the Internet is just one means, albeit an important one, by which to improve the human condition. It must be done with an appreciation for the civil and human rights that deserve protection - without pretending that access itself is such a right.","Like almost every major infrastructure, the Internet can be abused and its users harmed. We must, however, take great care that the cure for these ills does not do more harm than good. The benefits of the open and accessible Internet are nearly incalculable, and their loss would wreak significant social and economic damage.","History is rife with examples of governments taking actions to 'protect' their citizens from harm by controlling access to information and inhibiting freedom of expression and other freedoms outlined in The Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We must make sure, collectively, that the Internet avoids a similar fate.","Privacy may actually be an anomaly.","Some people argue we should solve all the problems on Earth before going off the planet, but that's like telling Lewis and Clark to stay put until the rest of the East was settled. No way.","The post office doesn't guarantee delivery, but it tries really hard. It's called best efforts communication. If you put two postcards in the post-box, they don't necessarily come out then in the same order that you put them in. So, that means that there's potentially disorder with your delivery, and that's also true in the Internet.","The three-piece suit has become sort of my trademark. You don't see them much anymore. It has several benefits: You may be overdressed on some occasions, but you can manage to fit into a huge range of circumstances.","I'm projecting somewhere between 100 million and 200 million computers on the Net by the end of December 2000, and about 300 million users by that same time.","We had no idea that this would turn into a global and public infrastructure.","In the earliest days, this was a project I worked on with great passion because I wanted to solve the Defense Department's problem: it did not want proprietary networking and it didn't want to be confined to a single network technology.","We will have more Internet, larger numbers of users, more mobile access, more speed, more things online and more appliances we can control over the Internet.","The purpose behind terrorism is to instill fear in people - the fear that electrical power, for instance, will be taken away or the transportation system will be taken down.","There's a tremendous amount of energy in Japan and, increasingly, in China.","Their Internet usage is growing very rapidly, and even they can do the math: If everyone in China needed an IPv4 address - just one - this country would use up one third of the entire public IP address space.","First of all, in terms of investment in Internet-related developments, venture capitalists - once burned - are now very cautious and are investing in areas that actually make business sense.","There is an underlying, fundamental reliance on the Internet, which continues to grow in the number of users, country penetration and both fixed and wireless broadband access.","Today we have 1 billion users on the Net. By 2010 we will have maybe 2 billion.","I expect to see a lot of household appliances on the Net by 2010, as well as autos and other mobile devices.","Movie distribution may very well have migrated fully to digital form by then, making a huge dent in the need to print film and physically distribute content.","There has been a substitution of ideology for fact and scientific and engineering data in this administration.","We live in a very complex world.","Although I've had several major career changes, I was extremely hesitant about making some of them.","I was very nervous about going up to teach at Stanford and very nervous even about going to ARPA.","But what we all have to learn is that we can't do everything ourselves.","In the larger companies, you have this tendency to get top-down direction.","In a small company, you often see a lot more of what goes on in a broader range of things. And that's good.","So, for me, working with larger companies has often been very satisfying, precisely because of the ability of bringing critical mass to bear on a given effort.","We never, ever in the history of mankind have had access to so much information so quickly and so easily.","There's an old maxim that says, 'Things that work persist,' which is why there's still Cobol floating around.","Choosing a single most important development is incredibly hard to do because a lot of different things had to happen before the Internet could be deployed in the fashion it is today.","The first commercial routers came out about 1986, and services came in 1987.","In 1973, the only cryptographic technology we could get our hands on was classified.","To be honest, I joined Facebook as an experiment. I accepted all invitations just to see how many people would ask to be 'friends' - it quickly overwhelmed my time to process even the invitations and requests, let alone to actually go there and do anything.","When I first joined Google in October of 2005, I was warned that I shouldn't be offended if people were doing their e-mails while a meeting was going on.","With Internet technology you can capture a photo, a quote, or an article, store it locally and upload it into the Net more than once, if you wish, to multiple sites. Can you imagine then forcing the search engines to somehow not index that information?","We've never lived in an environment in which it has been so easy to capture information and share it. That fact that it is digital and easy to transmit exacerbates that. I don't know that we know yet what social norms we wish to adopt.","Commercialization of assets off the planet would mutually reinforce the growth of interplanetary communication.","We all know the Internet didn't explode until it became a commercial enterprise. Space communication will probably have the same characteristic.","The Internet browser is the most susceptible to viruses. The browser is naive about downloading and executing software. Google is trying to help by releasing the Chrome browser as open source.","There needs to be some regime that is overseeing access to broadband to make sure we have openess; otherwise, there is a risk it won't be open anymore. We spent quite a bit of time with Verizon policy people in addition to participating in a multilateral discussion with the Federal Communications Commission.","It seems pretty clear that the Internet has an important economic role to play for China as it reaches out to the rest of the world.","The idea that Google, Yahoo, and eBay are getting a free ride is absolutely unfair criticism. We have to build out our own infrastructure. And we have to inter-connect to the public Internet.","It doesn't matter if it's a wireless or wired network. I think network management can be introduced that is equally sensible.","Google Apps for Education is a suite of applications intended to be helpful to higher level educational institutions, but in the long run, I think Google has a role to play in helping to assemble relevant content for classroom use.","The more we can organize, find and manage information, the more effectively we can function in our modern world.","You should know that I've been hearing-impaired, not quite since birth, but I've been wearing hearing aids since I was 13, so I'm very conscious of the difficulty of voice communication.","Written communication is a tremendous help for me, and so when electronic mail was invented in '71, I got very excited about it, thinking well, gee, the deaf community could really use this, or the hard-of-hearing community as well.","I can't say I'm particularly happy about all the spam and the viruses and the equivalent that we see on the Net, but I think technology can deal with many of the problems that we're now seeing, whether it's filtering or whatever, and laws may help a lot.","Virtually any appliance is going to be online. Appliances will talk to each other and to the power-generation system. Our appliances will pay attention to our preferences.","One thing we know for sure is that the Web is a collaborative medium unlike any we've ever had before. We see people working together, playing together, interacting in social settings using these media. We hope that will emerge as the new tool for education.","There is an odd mix of permeability and impermeability in the Net. You won't be able to communicate with everyone, and not every application will be accessible to everyone.","No matter what you do, any country in the world is going to have the ability to set its own rules internally. Any country in the world can pull the plug. It's not a question of technical issues, it's not a question of right or wrong, it's not a question of whether global Internet governance is right or wrong. It's just with us.","The big deal about the Internet design was you could have an arbitrary large number of networks so that they would all work together.","I just am a huge cheerleader for getting kids interested in science and technology.","It's important that the adults appreciate that young people are capable of doing really astounding work.","The government has a responsibility to protect society, to help maintain society. That's why we have laws... The rule of law creates a set of standards for our behavior.","The Internet is a really big tent. In theory, it can support the full range of models, one of which is, 'Here's my information and I'm happy you can use it,' and the other one is, 'Here's the information and you can't have it unless you pay me for it,' and perhaps some things in-between. There is a full spectrum of models.","Governments should look at investment in broadband as a national priority on the grounds that having broadband access for virtually everyone creates opportunities for the development of the economy that wouldn't otherwise be available.","Given that my title at Google is Chief Internet Evangelist, I feel like there is this great challenge before me because we have three billion users, and there are seven billion people in the world.","One thing that I can tell you that we have not done very well is to build in broadcast capability into the network, and we don't take advantage of broadcast radio.","The Internet of Things tell us that a lot of computer-enabled appliances and devices are going to become part of this system, too: appliances that you use around the house, that you use in your office, that you carry around with yourself or in the car. That's the Internet of Things that's coming.","There is a project that's underway called the interplanetary Internet. It's in operation between Earth and Mars. It's operating on the International Space Station. It's part of the spacecraft that's in orbit around the Sun that's rendezvoused with two planets.","Sleep is a waste of time.","By 1988, I'm seeing this commercial phenomenon beginning to show up. Hardware makers are selling routers to universities so they can build up their campus networks. So I remember thinking, 'Well, how are we going to get this in the hands of the general public?' There were no public Internet services at that point.","Although the FCC has tried to introduce net neutrality rules to avoid abusive practices like favoring your own services over others, they have struggled because there has been more than one court case in which it was asserted the FCC didn't have the authority to punish ISPs for abusing their control over the broadband channel.","When I joined Google, they asked me what title I wanted. I said, 'What about archduke?' They said, 'Well, that didn't meet our nomenclature. Why don't you be our Chief Internet Evangelist?' This was in 2005.","Internet and government is Topic A in every nation, all around the world. There is the question of getting the Internet built. That involves persuading government to have regulatory policies. It involves new technology to bring the Internet to rural places.","Sorting through what social conventions we ought to adopt for the Internet is a pretty tricky and complicated topic. I think we are just going to live through a lot of these issues until we discover what social norms make sense.","Writing software is a very intense, very personal thing. You have to have time to work your way through it, to understand it. Then debug it.","While the United States has never decreed that everyone has a 'right' to a telephone, we have come close to this with the notion of 'universal service' - the idea that telephone service (and electricity, and now broadband Internet) must be available, even in the most remote regions of the country.","When I helped to develop the open standards that computers use to communicate with one another across the Net, I hoped for but could not predict how it would blossom and how much human ingenuity it would unleash.","While many governments are committed to maintaining flexible regimes for fast-moving Internet technologies, some others have been quite explicit about their desire to put a single U.N. or other intergovernmental body in control of the Net.","What would happen if our clothes were Internet-enabled? Can you imagine if you lost a sock? You could send out a search, and sock No. 3117 would respond that it's under the couch in the living room.","You don't have to know how to build an automobile or a television set or a laptop to know how to use it.","Several authoritarian regimes reportedly propose to ban anonymity from the web, making it easier to find and arrest dissidents. At Google, we see and feel the dangers of the government-led net crackdown. We operate in about 150 countries around the globe.","The internet has become one of the motors of the 21st century economy, allowing all of us to reach a global audience at a click of a mouse and creating hundreds of thousands of businesses and millions of jobs.","The bottom-up, loosely-coupled, bilateral and multi-stakeholder practices that have created the network of networks we call the Internet allow for a broad range of business models.","In a town of 3,000 people, there is no privacy. Everybody knows what everybody is doing.","The idea was that you could grow a system like the Internet one network at a time and then interconnect them. In some sense, the most important thing was the invention of the architecture protocols that enabled the Internet.","I am annoyed by people that send messages via FaceBook because I get an e-mail telling me there is a message on FaceBook - so I end up processing two messages for every one sent.","I think exploring the Internet's - and the Web's - ability to facilitate personal linkages is remarkable; and expect to see additional social networking applications and services emerge.","We have already discovered how quickly we become dependent on the Internet and its applications for business, government and research, so it is not surprising that we are finding that we can apply this technology to enable or facilitate our social interactions as well.","Henry Kissinger once told me he was very concerned about the Internet's impact on people's ability to absorb information in a concentrated way, because we've become accustomed to looking up something, getting a snippet and being satisfied with that - as opposed to reading through and considering a weighty tome that goes into great depth.","Remember, 'governance' is a big word that includes human rights, freedom of speech, economic transactions on a worldwide basis - it touches everything. It's everywhere, and that's why Internet governance is Topic A in many corners.","The immediacy of the mobile changes it from what we're accustomed to in the personal computing world to something that's instantaneous... What's interesting and powerful about the mobile environment is that it's connected to services on the Internet. This augments both platforms.","For systems in which you already have a lot of hardware and software, change is difficult. That's why apps are so popular.","I used to tell jokes about Internet-enabled lightbulbs. I can't tell jokes about it anymore - there already is an Internet-connected lightbulb.","The Internet is brittle and fragile and too easy to take down. It's a conduit for criminal activity. We need international treaties to prosecute the bad guys, but we don't have them.","Will we shoot virtually at each other over the Internet? Probably not. On the other hand, there may be wars fought about the Internet.","One of my favorite books is 'The Swiss Family Robinson.' The reason is, I'm fascinated by the postapocalyptic recovery. What do we do in a disaster? How do we make do?","It may seem like sort of a waste of time to play 'World of Warcraft' with your son. But you're actually interacting with each other. You're solving problems. They may seem like simple problems, but you're solving them. You're posed with challenges that you have to overcome. You're on a quest to gain certain capabilities.","At the roots, people are still people. That's why Shakespeare is so popular no matter what the language.","85% of all video we watch is pre-recorded, so you can set your system to download it all the time. You're still going to need live television for certain things - like news, sporting events and emergencies - but increasingly it is going to be almost like the iPod, where you download content to look at later.","I want more Internet. I want every one of the 6 billion people on the planet to be able to connect to the Internet - I think they will add things to it that will really benefit us all.","Allowing a handful of broadband carriers to determine what people see and do online would fundamentally undermine the features that have made the Internet such a success, and could permanently compromise the Internet as a platform for the free exchange of information, commerce, and ideas."],"Viola Davis":["Your ability to adapt to failure, and navigate your way out of it, absolutely 100 percent makes you who you are.","Because I grew up in such tight spaces, I don't get manicures, pedicures. I'm not into cars, but I am into a fabulous house. I wanted the spiral staircase, clean sheets on the bed, to be able to take a shower.","The reason I became an actress is because I wanted my acting to reflect life as it is. I want to put truth on the screen. I want real women to see real women on the screen.","I definitely have a happy marriage and family life.","I would like to say that I'm a walking poster board for feminism and women's liberation, but there are things that I do in my life that deeply, deeply fall short of being a statement for being a strong woman. I am flawed as much as anyone else.","I know that love is real when it's not convenient, when it's not selfish, when it's challenged, sometimes even if it's not reciprocated.","We all have different narratives; all of our narratives are at different stages of development.","I truly believe that the privilege of a lifetime is being who you are.","I reserve the right to be a mess and completely unlikable.","As an actor, every opportunity, every role, everything that I do is an opportunity to have someone have a human experience with my work. I don't just want it to be about a cute wardrobe and a high paycheck.","I love Wal-Mart. You can put that down. I love Wal-Mart. My husband and I hang out there.","I'm in the business of creating human beings.","The predator wants your silence. It feeds their power, entitlement, and they want it to feed your shame.","I tell my daughter every morning, 'Now, what are the two most important parts of you?' And she says, 'My head and my heart.' Because that's what I've learned in the foxhole: What gets you through life is strength of character and strength of spirit and love.","I don't know how I got a great husband. I mean, God just blessed me with that one. Because - trust me - before him, I was not making good choices. So I was just absolutely blessed. I just prayed for that man He's my secret weapon because he's so gregarious, and he's so filled with joy. Me? I can sometimes be more cynical, and I'm very shy.","There's no prerequisites to worthiness. You're born worthy, and I think that's a message a lot of women need to hear.","It became motivation as opposed to something else - the thing about poverty is that it starts affecting your mind and your spirit because people don't see you. I chose from a very young age that I didn't want that for my life. And it very much has helped me appreciate and value the things that are in my life now because I never had it.","I always talk to all the crew. I always make it pleasant. I always nurture a relationship that makes people feel like they're important, like they're a part of the collaboration. I feel that way about the young actors on set. I don't talk to them like I'm the mentor; I talk to them like they're my peers. And I learned that from Meryl Streep.","It feels like my hard work has paid off, but at the same time, I still have the impostor, you know, syndrome. I still feel like I'm going to wake up, and everybody's going to see me for the hack I am.","What do you want? What do you want your life to be? What do you want your testimony to be? Go for it!","I suffered from low self-esteem for much of my life. And now to feel like maybe something that I'm projecting or saying could mean something to someone means a lot to me.","Acting is not rocket science, but it is an art form. What you are doing is illuminating humanity. Or not.","Sometimes you see how humanity can rise above any kind of cultural ills and hate that a person's capacity to love and communicate and forgive can be bigger than anything else.","I have been down and out, living in Brooklyn, no money even for a subway, no food whatsoever. Like, I remember just sitting in my room all day - even my television wasn't working!","We have to stop thinking about diversity and start thinking about inclusion. That's what you can take from August Wilson. That there are whole cultures out there living experiences exactly like yours, and their stories can be just as dynamic, sold in the foreign market, put as many butts in the seats as any Caucasian movie out there.","When you grow up poor, you dream of just having a hom, and a bed that's clean - that's a sanctuary. Having a really great husband, a child who's healthy and happy and brings me joy - all of that has been my dream.","I know I'm not the best, but I'm proud of myself.","Your job as an actor is to piece together whatever you've learned in your training, or whatever you have experienced in your life, to piece together a person.","I was bullied at school. The black girl in Central Falls, Rhode Island, in 1973. There'd be 8 or 10 boys; I would count them as I was running.","August Wilson is the one writer that writes about men like my father, who had a fifth grade education, who was a janitor at McDonald's.","Sometimes there is no sugar-coating it. Sometimes you have to challenge people's belief systems in a progressive way.","I heard about the book and I said, 'Oh my god, I've got to read this book,' and I didn't know that a white woman wrote it. Nobody said that to me, they just said, 'The Help - Oh my god, you've got to read it.' Everyone failed to mention it was a white woman, I think, because nobody really wants to talk about race.","And this is what was fascinating to me about 'The Help'; they were ordinary people who did extraordinary things.","Can I just tell you, I think it's the most beautiful thing about young people today, it gives me so much hope for the future, that they don't really recognize race the way my generation does.","Well, first of all, you read the script a million times. Because what the script gives you are given circumstances. Given circumstances are all the facts of your character.","When you're working as an actor, you don't think that when you get out of school, it's going to be so hard to get a job. Just to get a job. Any job. Whatsoever. You don't think that people are going to see you in a certain way.","I didn't see myself any different from my white counterparts in school. I just didn't! I thought I could do what they did. And what I didn't do well, I thought people were going to give me the opportunity to do well, because maybe they saw my talent, so they would give me a chance. I had no idea that they would see me completely different.","I've been online doing all kinds of research and that seems to be the constant criticism, that Aibileen's accent was just too thick. And for me, I don't want anything to distract from the character.","I do believe that there are African Americans who have thick accents. My mom has a thick accent; my relatives have thick accents. But sometimes you have to adjust when you go into the world of film, TV, theatre, in order to make it accessible to people.","Your internal dialogue has got to be different from what you say. And, you know, in film, hopefully that registers and speaks volumes. It's always the unspoken word and what's happening behind someone's eyes that makes it so rich.","In life, you know, they do this in focus groups; if you were in such and such circumstance, what would you do? Well, you never know what you're going do unless you're faced with it.","Tyler Perry's 'Madea Goes to Jail!' Which, I have to tell you, of everything that I've ever done in my career, that's the only thing that's perked up the ears of my nieces and nephews. That is it, that's done it for them. That made me a bona fide star in their eyes!","I worked in television; I'm the Failed Pilot Queen, I've done so many television shows, pilots, theater ... when you do it for so long, I'm telling you, you get to the point where it becomes varied because you take what's available for a number of reasons. It's just an occupational hazard.","Sometimes you take a job for the money, sometimes you take it for the location, sometimes you take it for the script; there are just a number of reasons, and ultimately what you see is the whole landscape of it. But I can tell you from behind the scenes - that's what it is, as an actor.","I think that's something that people feel that I do really well; I don't mind it, because ultimately I think the characters I play move people, and who wouldn't want to move people?","That's why I do what I do, and that's why I wanted to be an actress from the time I was six years old. If I can't effectively move people, then I would prefer not to do it.","And that's what people want to see when they go to the theater. I believe at the end of the day, they want to see themselves - parts of their lives they can recognize. And I feel if I can achieve that, it's pretty spectacular.","I can't deal with actors! I can't deal with myself. We're neurotic and miserable ... I love doing what I'm doing, but while I'm doing it, I'm miserable.","We grew up in abject poverty. Acting, writing scripts and skits were a way of escaping our environment at a very young age.","To the predators... Weinstein, the stranger, the relative, the boyfriend... I say to you, 'You can choose your sin but you don't get to choose the consequences.' To the victims... I see you. I believe you... and I'm listening.","I feel that confidence in women - especially young girls of color - but women, in general, is so important. It is so important for us to arm ourselves and become powerful at a very young age.","If I have to be at work at five A.M., I will get up at three and work out. I run. I do weights. I'm very toned. I'm like every other woman. I'd love to be 10 pounds or 20 pounds lighter. If I'm not, I'm OK with that, too. I'm good as long as I'm healthy.","I played several maids in my career. I was tired of the maid after 'Far From Heaven.' I said, no more maids. Until I realized how difficult it was to get a role other than a maid, sometimes, in Hollywood, and sometimes you have to choose your battles, for lack of a better term.","I think many women are successful in their professional lives - they are making the money and all that - but in their personal lives are a complete mess, because they haven't paid any attention to it, because they spent all of their time being successful.","I would love to do really great work and for women who are marginalised to see me as an inspiration.","I feel at home in Shondaland. I feel a lot of things at Shondaland, but one of the things I feel that I haven't felt before is at home. I feel accepted for who I am and acknowledged for who I am. I feel like my ideas are embraced.","I've always felt like I was an actor for hire. And almost apologetic for being a woman of color, trying to stifle that voice. But I don't feel that way in Shondaland. I feel like I am accepted into a world where I'm a part of the narrative - I'm a part of it.","I always feel terrified whenever I put my work out there to be seen, to be scrutinized. I think it's a very vulnerable thing that we are asked to do.","If it were just a dream to be famous, then I probably would have died a really quick death, because there is nothing about me that equals fame. I'm not a standup comedian. I don't sing.","I didn't aspire to be just a celebrity; I aspired to be an actress... I always wanted to be respected as someone who knew their craft.","You can't be perceived as 'the black actress who doesn't get the same kind of roles as the white actress.' You gotta run the same race. You gotta give the same quality of performances. You gotta have the same standard of excellence, even though people know that you're coming to the race in a deficit. That's just what life is about.","When a character has so many secrets and so much inner life, it's a joy to play those characters because you can use your craft.","I don't care if someone is new to acting or experienced in acting: you always learn something from them. It's just like people in life - whether they're young or middle-aged or old, you always learn something from someone.","Every job I've ever gotten has transformed me in some way as an actor.","Egos are an occupational hazard in acting, but I don't have much of one, and my husband doesn't have much of one, so it's good.","I live a fantastic life. Why should I complain about awards?","He is a regular guy who absolutely is not attracted to his own celebrity. He's a jokester, a little rough around the edges, with great heart and compassion; he loves his family. I feel very comfortable with him. I don't see 'Denzel Washington Star'; I just see Denzel.","The only picture I have of my childhood is the picture of me in kindergarten. I have this expression on my face - it's not a smile, it's not a frown. I swear to you, that's the girl who wakes up in the morning and who looks around her house and her life saying, 'I cannot believe how God has blessed me.'","I was the kind of poor where I knew right away I had less than everyone around me. Our environment, our physical space reflected our income.","It's a dream to be able to just play a multi-faceted character.","You want to be able to really tackle a character and make it a fully-dimensional human being who is complicated, funny, and all the things that a person could be. If you can achieve that, you feel great. You so rarely get to do that as an actress in general, but as a black actress, it's almost never.","Flashy characters are more entertaining to people because you get it. You don't have to work to get someone who says what they mean and says what they think. They're out there. It's harder to play a quiet character because everything happens in their stream of consciousness.","People who are alone all the time never grow. Those hermits just stay the same. It's only through relationships. Relationships change us and make us grow.","I have been given a lot of roles that are downtrodden, mammy-ish. A lot of lawyers or doctors who have names but absolutely no lives. You're going to get your three or four scenes; you're not going to be able to show what you can do.","When you grow up in abject poverty, you see people exactly the way they are.","Vanity destroys your work. That's the one thing you have to let go of as an actor. I don't care how sexy or beautiful any woman is. At the end of the day, she has to take her makeup off. At the end of the day, she's more than just pretty.","My whole thing is, I've got to be as good, as courageous as what's written on the page.","When you see a parent pass, and you literally are there, and you're sitting at that deathbed, man, and you have to tell them to go, it defines life for what it really is.","Acting came from growing up in dysfunction. I mean, a lot of great times, but a lot of dysfunction.","I have had issues in the past with the characters and the limitations of the characters and the structure of the narratives given to me as a woman of color.","Turning 50 is making me reflect on my life in a way that's more compassionate and forgiving.","You have to have an unlimited imagination, an unlimited restraint on your inhibition when you're working. You have to even dare to fail, even in a scene, whatever it is.","You have to dare to make a choice that may be considered unorthodox in a role, but when you're working as if there are tons of people watching you, that's not necessarily a good thing.","'Fences' is under the headline of the project of my lifetime. It is the most perfect and undeniably developed narrative that I've ever worked on.","I still feel like when I walk on the set, I'm starting from scratch, until I realize, 'OK, I do know what I'm doing. I'm human.'","Self-deprecation is not the answer to humility.","You're only reduced to a cliche if you don't humanize a character.","My grandmom worked as a maid for most of her life, and she worked in the tobacco and the cotton fields, whatever she could get.","I don't see a lot of narratives written where a woman who looks like me gets to be beautiful and sexualized and upwardly mobile, middle-class, funny, quirky. They're very seldom written.","I think sometimes what people miss about black people is that we're complicated, that we are indeed messy, that we do our best with what we've been given. We come into the world exactly like you. It's just that there are circumstances in the culture that are dictated and put on our lives that we have to fight against.","People don't understand that when you come into any theatrical experience, you've got to come locked and loaded, that you're a part of the experience, too. You can't come with your arms crossed. Be open to it.","My grandmother's house was a one room shack.","What it meant for me to win the Emmy is I found it. It's not just the award. It's what it's going to mean to young girls - young brown girls, especially. When they saw a physical manifestation of a dream, I felt like I had fulfilled a purpose.","I'm the journeyman actor that you saw in one scene here, two scenes there. I've been eking out a living doing theater - Broadway, Off Broadway - film supporting roles, that I'm just excited to be a part of the conversation.","I think women are very complicated human beings, and I think there's an oversimplification of women when you see them on screen.","I feel the same way about Shondaland I feel about Africa and Greece. I feel pretty in both places. Men look at me like I'm a novelty, and women think I'm just cool. I feel absolutely at home immediately. I'm not altering myself to fit in. I'm walking in just as I am. And there are open arms stretched out to greet me.","The only thing that separates women of color from everyone else is opportunity.","That's always the biggest surprise when people meet me: how buoyant I am and how fun and light I am.","I look back on those early days in the theater like the beginning of a love affair, when you're totally in love with the work, and that's all there is.","I stumbled onto the best profession to heal my childhood: the only one that lets you release and express whatever is ugly and messy and beautiful about your life. We're in the business of creating human beings. The more we spew, and the more honestly we do it, the better. Try that on Wall Street.","So many women characters are extensions of male fantasy.","Those things that we probably are ashamed of as human beings, certain things that no one would ever talk about - as actors, when we transform into a character, we empathize with those moments.","'Rebel' is not a word I would describe for myself, but I feel like I was a total rebel being an actor. It made me feel like there was something in me, a passion, a love - and that I didn't just squelch it.","When people come into the theater, whether it's the screen or the stage, they've gotta be transported and transformed.","When you're poor, you are invisible. Every poor person will tell you nobody sees you. So being famous was me just wanting to be seen.","I just want different narratives for people of color, especially women of color. I just want something that's different. I don't want us to be put in a box. I want it to be kind of a redefinition of who were are. If I can even achieve that in a tiny way, I'll be good. I'll be good.","There's got to be a voice deep within you that is untouched by definitions. And it is there that you become divinely who you are.","We didn't have money all the time to do laundry. A lot of the time, we didn't have soap or hot water. We were smart kids academically, but we'd go to school smelling.","I did everything to get food. I have stolen for food. I have jumped in huge garbage bins with maggots for food. I have befriended people in the neighborhood who I knew had mothers who cooked three meals a day for food, and I sacrificed a childhood for food and grew up in immense shame.","The big 'Aha!' moment is that the trauma never goes away.","I cannot believe my life. I just can't. I'm so blessed.","You cannot win an Emmy for roles that are simply not there.","What excites me is just taking some time to breathe in life. The mundane is very exciting.","When you are an actor, you are in the most powerless position in this business.","I don't know why directing is not something I'm interested in.","I think I've lived long enough to understand that plans really are very overrated.","This is the richest country in the world. There's no reason kids should be going to school hungry. Food is something that everyone should have. It just is.","I've had to sink my teeth into a role that was probably a fried-chicken dinner and make it into a filet mignon.","I think tapping into one's power and one's potential is a very frightening thing.","The more I'm pushed in a position of leadership and I know I have to be the mouthpiece for so many other people who can't speak for themselves, the more confidence I'm gaining."],"Violante Placido":["I did a smaller gig with an acoustic guitar and a drum machine. In one song, something wrong happened with the drum machine. I tried to cover up the mistake by playing faster and improvising a new song but it became crazy, and I had to admit it was all a mess.","My parents never pushed me to be an actress. You can come from a family of actors, and sometimes there have been families that grow you up as an actor, but this wasn't my situation. It's very important to find your own way because it's something you then have to confront yourself.","When I was really young, I got moonstruck by 'Moonstruck.'","Turkey was fantastic, Turkey was, like, mystical and such a special place. Just unique, something that's really hard to describe, such beauty, those mountains and the stone is kind of, eroded? Special erosion which makes what you see just something that seems, it's been made for a movie, it's like something out of fantasy, except it's real.","I write in English. My first album came out in Italy, and I toured and did gigs.","When I'm shooting films, I write and play music when I come home.","I've done movies that were maybe not worth it, but I try to take the best from every experience. You learn more from bad experiences sometimes. It gives you more will to overcome your mistakes. They give you determination."],"Violette Leduc":["There's no sustenance in the past.","My mother never took my hand.","At the age of five, of six, at the age of seven, I used to begin weeping sometimes without warning, simply for the sake of weeping, my eyes open wide to the sun, to the flowers... I wanted to feel an immense grief inside me, and it came.","To find relief in what has been, we must make ourselves eternal.","I was afraid of having to present my big nose to strangers."],"Vir Das":["Delhi women - they're the most beautiful women! But the fact remains that they know they are gorgeous.","Time management is the mantra of my life.","I love the food, the girls, the sky and everything that is Delhi. I have very fond memories of the Moolchand flyover.","I feel like I share a great relationship with my audience where they trust my judgment and choice of films and sense of comedy.","I am edgy, raw, offensive, vulgar, untruthful, but intelligent. My jokes are always realistic. I do not make fun of children or people who cannot fight back. That is my limitation.","Comedy comes from confusion.","Surround yourself with a bunch of like-minded people, and you'll soak up their habits like a starved sponge. Fat people with fat friends care less about their weight.","I think of myself as an Indian comedian, but I've had British and American schooling. I always had this feeling of not fitting in anywhere, of observing situations from the outside.","Whether I am on a stage, behind a guitar or in front of a camera, I get paid to misbehave. Fortunately, misbehaviour is something I have unlimited supply of.","Stand-up comedy is a lot about amplifying emotions and situations; movie acting has a lot to do with mellowing things down and making them subtle. The transition was almost terrifying because of the magnitude of change.","The idea is to do out-of-the-box films that showcase my versatility and talent.","All of the films I'm doing are young, urban, high-concept, funny films. That's the zone where I'd like to play and have fun in.","Women do come up to me after a show, but it's usually to say, 'Yhank you for making us laugh,' and all that.","What I tell a girl is, your six-pack hot boyfriend right now, in six years, will be balding and maybe have a paunch. But I make you laugh every five minutes today, and I'll make you laugh 20 years from now; that's not going to go away.","I'm a stand-up comedian-turned-actor-turned-vampire at night.","I'm kind of a rebound junkie. So. when a relationship goes sour, I look at the sweetness in life elsewhere. So, I date a bit. The best catharsis is to write jokes and tell 4,000 people about it.","I fear debt. I don't like being indebted to banks. I have a rule in life that I will get it when I can afford it.","I've a belt that I have worn for every single stand-up comedy session since I was 19. I fear if I ever lose it, my career would crumble. That's my one OCD.","If you are known to do something well, people want to see you do that. But what you choose to do is up to you. After 'Delhi Belly,' I got some 40 scripts - some on the same lines as 'Delhi Belly.' So, I guess people only get stereotyped if they want to.","I got 'Delhi Belly' and 'Badmaash Company' because people from the production house had seen my stand-up comic acts in a DVD that was lying in their offices. It's been a weird journey, and I think weird goes with me.","A stand-up comedian will never be the life of a party. Instead, he will be the guy who is standing at a corner and observing people.","Anybody with a sharp brain and a mic can become a comedian, but there's a need to move beyond it. The audience wants to witness the marriage of theatre, comedy and something more.","Alien Chutney is just what the name suggests it is. Its music that is so funny and quirky and weird that it feels entirely alien to the listener; yet, the content and the subject matter is so Indian and relatable, it's still chutney.","I wouldn't call myself successful, just obsessively exhausted. The music makes me smile, the movies make me feel humbled, and the comedy saves my life every day.","Comedy is a live art, and the only way to record a comedy rock album is to do it live. The audience and their laughter is just as much a part of the album sound as our music. No retakes, no room for error.","While Mumbai is a melting pot of cultures, Delhi is made of community, and we can see these lines quite clearly. An aunty from Punjabi Bagh will be different from a Faridabad aunty or an aunty from Vasant Kunj.","I was only 24 years old when a lady called Sabina Sehgal Saikia - the then 'Delhi Times' editor - asked me to host the 'Times Food Guide Awards,' so it was with The 'Times of India' that my career began in this field.","I auditioned nine times for 'Delhi Belly,' and it was torturous!","It might sound cliched, but choosing the right script is crucial. I think 'Badmaash Company' was a very big break for me because it gave me a lot of appreciation from the masses. It made me more confident as an actor.","Whatever movies I sign, they have to get me out of my comfort zone. Otherwise, I would get bored very easily.","My personal favorite is Woody Allen, who is just amazing as a comedian.","In Bollywood, I think Boman Irani and Vinay Pathak are unbelievably good at comedy.","I've been reading a lot of books on history, and watching a lot of educational TV. Wikipedia too, even though it is not reliable.","I don't think one gets to choose the kind of comedy he/she does. I may not talk about Rahul Gandhi's take on an ordinance, but I will talk about things as simple as a 'chappal' or a 'sherwani.' My comedy is about small things, and that is how it connects.","I did theatre in the U.S. because there, content-wise, it's very light. In India, theatre tends to get preachy.","In a big Bollywood romantic film, taking my shirt off and spreading the hand towards the mountain with dancers behind me are not my cup of tea.","I am a big fan of Adam Sandler and Ben Stiller, who have carved a niche for themselves. I think doing different kind of films gives you longevity and the ability to set yourself apart.","It's very important to not repeat yourself. After 'Delhi Belly,' I was offered 40 'Delhi Belly's and you can't do that! So 'Revolver Rani' is dark and gritty with action, 'Sooper Se Oopar' is a big commercial love story, 'Santa Banta' is a 'theth' Punjabi comedy, 'Golu Aur Pappu' is a kids' film and 'Amit Sahni Ki List' is an urban romcom.","In Bollywood, people struggle because there is a new person joining every week, who joins an assembly line of people who are very replaceable. But if you are unique, you don't have to struggle that much.","In 'Delhi Belly,' I was bald; in other movies I always carried a different look.","I am honestly very intimidated when I meet new people and they expect me to be the onscreen Vir. On stage, I say a lot of things I might never say in real life; I am never the life of the party. People are quite surprised to see that I am more of a quiet artiste off stage.","Class I to XII wasn't much help; I was always a mediocre student. But when I pursued higher education and studied economics with theatre or psychology with science fiction, I got a whole new world view.","You realise the responsibility of carrying a film on your shoulders when people are investing money in you and they recognise the hard work you have to put in.","What is important to me as an actor is that, even if I have to spread my arms, take my shirt off on a mountain top with my heroine in a chiffon sari, it still has to be me and my twist or my funny take on it.","For me, it is very important to believe in the kind of movies I do. 'Rang De Basanti' made me feel good about Indian cinema. The movie instilled in me a confidence so strong, that I wanted to be a part of the revolution in Bollywood.","Chennai is one of the scariest crowds to face. Everyone looks so conservative, but once you crack the first joke, they are so appreciatively loud that they will hit you with a laugh that will scare you stiff and yet give you energy. Chennaiites give me the loudest laughs; it's the coolest crowd to perform for.","I have a rule - 'funny is funny!' When I write comedy, it's not my aim to upset people. I will be offensive, edgy and immature, but I will also be very intelligent and relevant. At my shows, there are no holy cows.","Relationship humour gets the most laughs. If I'm able to get the women laughing, men will have to laugh along because they would be scared to death.","When it comes to English stand-up comedy, Indians have only seen the best - Jerry Seinfeld, Bill Cosby and the like. So, when someone claims to be an English stand-up comedian in India, he'd better be very good if he's going to make a life of it.","A lot of people do comedy about India, but they're not from India. It's a Kwik-E-Mart perspective. I want to provide a genuine view and maybe one on how we see the West.","'Badmaash Company' and 'Delhi Belly' was about friends, and I was part of the gang. And yes, they did have stars playing the lead! You do need a star to sell a film; and playing the second lead doesn't bother me.","Movies require a lot of patience. I like instant results. If I have done something that's not funny at all, the audience will let me know in two seconds. With the movie, I will have to wait nine months to know if I was that bad.","I do films which get me out of my comedian routine so that I don't get bored being a stand-up comedian. And with films, it's here today, gone tomorrow. So stand-up comedy is here to stay for me.","To me, the trick is not how can I make people laugh. It is, how can I make people laugh in a different way."],"Virat Kohli":["Self-belief and hard work will always earn you success.","No cricket team in the world depends on one or two players. The team always plays to win.","I like to be myself, and I don't pretend. For instance, I don't dress up for occasions; I am what I am.","In cricket, my superhero is Sachin Tendulkar. He has always been my hero and will continue to remain so. Apart from him and outside cricket, my mother has remained my inspiration. Whatever difficult time I had faced, she was always there for me. She has given me all the strength. She maintained her composure and supported me in tough times.","A fit body gives you confidence. And there's nothing more impressive than a great attitude, which you can wear on your sleeve. But you'll have to remember the difference between being rude and being confident.","I support Real Madrid. I'm a big fan of Cristiano Ronaldo.","I do believe in God. But you won't find me visiting temples every now and then. I believe in self-realization. Peace of mind matters a lot to me. What's the point in doing something just for the sake of it? I'd rather do something I like doing as long as I'm being true to myself.","My priority is cricket. Everything that I get apart from it is a result of the effort on the field. Everything else follows. I am pretty aware of my priorities, and I don't really focus on things that are not as important to me as cricket.","The people you choose to have around you make all the difference. My family and close friends keep me grounded. You have to have a mind of your own and a strong head on your shoulders. Cricket is the most important thing to me, so the rest of it pales in comparison.","In the game of cricket, a hero is a person who respects the game and does not corrupt the game. The one who doesn't or corrupts the game, they are the villain. They should be punished, and they have been punished in the past.","The bat is not a toy, it's a weapon. It gives me everything in life, which helps me to do everything on the field.","I always dreamt of holding the bat and winning games for India. That was my inspiration to take up cricket.","I love tattoos. And mine symbolise who I really am. I have a Samurai on my left arm. At a subconscious level, I connect to this warrior and model myself on his discipline, skills and honour. There is also a tribal tattoo and a Chinese symbol of faith. I have seen a lot of people getting tattoos just because it's a trend.","Delhi means everything to me. This city has given me everything, and I love it.","I love playing under pressure. In fact, if there's no pressure, then I'm not in the perfect zone.","Unless someone wants to look funny, I'll not recommend anyone to copy my bowling action. But on a serious note, with the confidence that I have got from the amount of runs I have been scoring, when I'm thrown the ball to bowl, I am pretty sure of what I have to do. I may not be the most attractive to watch while bowling, but I can be effective.","I'm not comparing myself with anyone, but I am very confident about my captaincy, as I have already led India and in the IPL also. I have confidence I can bring out each player's ability fully and also give them a lot of confidence... I would like to stick to what I know best and what I have confidence in.","Pretension is a poor joke that you play on yourself. Snap out of it. Recognise your strengths, work on your weaknesses. Real achievement is liking what you see in the mirror every morning.","I get really motivated when I put on the India jersey. It is a responsibility, so I want to perform in the best way I can.","I wasn't sure of the exact mindset you should have when you go into a Test match. So I probably became too defensive when I played my first Test match. Short balls in one-day cricket, I have never thought of just defending.","I love wearing whatever is comfortable, and that could be something which was in trend years ago. So, I don't follow fashion.","Whatever you want to do, do with full passion and work really hard towards it. Don't look anywhere else. There will be a few distractions, but if you can be true to yourself, you will be successful for sure.","My shopping habits... I am not very brand-conscious about clothes. I buy whatever looks good on me. Likewise, I don't just shop only in malls or high-end stores.","I feel only my friends and family need to know what is happening in my personal life.","During my school days, I was doing a play, and my costume fell on the stage. I really wish it didn't happen.","I am very happy playing and showing off my talent on the cricket field and have no plans to enter Bollywood.","People from North India are generally known to be aggressive and emotional.","Irrespective of whether you have talent or not, one has to work hard. Just being talented doesn't mean anything; you can end up wasting it before you realize.","I love soccer, love tennis... Roger Federer has been a favourite for a long, long time. The kind of consistency he has shown, 16 Grand Slam titles... The way he handles himself in pressure situations is admirable... He is so calm... In soccer, I'm a huge fan of Barcelona... I like watching Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and David Villa.","A lot of people tell me a lot of things about my conduct, my game, my future... but I try to stay away from their words of wisdom. I don't let it distract me. On the field, you will be facing the ball alone. If you fail, you will the only one to blame. So, you should be the one deciding for yourself.","I delayed my father's funeral because of cricket.","In T20, you don't have time to get distracted - it's so quick, you have to run around in the field, and while batting, you don't actually think about anything else.","I'm not a nerd, obviously. Do I look like one? I'm not someone who sits at home and doesn't like to go out, doesn't like to watch movies. I like to live my life.","I want my wardrobe to be full of good clothes, so that when I'm deciding what to wear, I don't run out of options. I love shopping!","I am a fan of the 'Rocky' films, and 'Rocky 4' is my favourite. I also like 'The Warriors.'","I have made a few mistakes early on that I admit myself, and there have been times when I have gone over the top and done things that you shouldn't do in international cricket, but that's how you learn.","I like to always lead from the front and set an example for whoever is playing with me or around me. I like taking responsibilities. That is my natural thing.","Probably because I'm from a middle class family, I have that nature in me that I don't get too excited with big things.","It was a personal decision for me to stand and say that cricket is all I have in life, there's nothing I need to do other than cricket. If I want to achieve whatever I thought as a kid, I need to work hard and not let it go to waste.","I do not abuse players. I talk to myself; I abuse myself. It's my way of letting off steam. I do it after every century; I do not do it always. I keep telling myself: 'Improve, improve from the previous match, the previous shot. You can do it.'","You have to stay fresh and blank in your mind when you go out to bat. You complicate things, and you're gone.","My focus had always been the on-side. My coach wanted me to work on the offside strokes since he was convinced of my ability and timing on the leg side. I worked hard and firmed up my defensive technique. I am happy getting runs all around the wicket now, and getting a lot of boundaries. No one calls me a 'leggie batsman' anymore.","I believe that fairness creams protect the skin against the harsh effects of the sun.","There are two bowlers who I think are very tough to play against - Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel.","The first thing I look forward to when I am in Delhi is to spend some time with my family. It's always lovely coming back here and playing in front of my own people. It's just a special place.","My main focus is always to do well on the field for the Indian cricket team. When people say good things about me off the field, I am more than happy to accept them.","I don't really read a lot of newspapers. I don't pay attention to what is being said or written about me. I've had lots of experiences in the past when I got too much into it. That sort of diverts your focus.","Becoming an inspiration for kids is great. I want to inspire them to do whatever they want to.","You just feel a little odd when you don't get your kind of food. Fortunately, there are Indian restaurants all over the world.","Never at any point did I feel like missing a training session. I was very keen on improving as a cricketer and as an international player.","'Border' was the first movie that I watched on the big screen. It always takes me back to my childhood.","I'm not someone who sits at home and doesn't like to go out, doesn't like to watch movies. I like to live my life.","Nothing extraordinary happens to a cricketer if you time his career - which is very short.","Everyone loves a win in India. No one wants to lose a match. It is the cricketer who absorbs all the pressure.","I've had a fan who made a painting of my face with her fingers. I have put it up in my room. It was sweet and very different.","I really want a movie made on Sachin Tendulkar's life. That is something I'm looking forward to. There will be so much emotion to that movie.","I want to elongate my cricketing career as a consistent player. I have personal goals I would like to achieve someday.","I love trying out different cuisines. In Delhi, I love Megu at the Leela, and TK's at the Hyatt. I also enjoy Khan Chacha's rolls. In Mumbai, it's Royal China and Shiro. And in Bangalore, I like the food at Bricklane.","I love driving my car on any highway.","The more centuries that I am able to score, the happier I will be.","As a kid, even I knew everything about my favourite cricketers. I used to know everything possible. Now I see kids knowing about me. It feels good.","I've been lucky - all the ads I've got, I've got to be myself. I haven't had to act too much or tried too hard to be someone I'm not. I think that's why people sort of like them. Even the Fastrack ads I did with Genelia.","Good Punjabi music before a match pumps me up. It gives me a kick.","Music, for me, is vital. Punjabi, Bollywood, Sufi, RnB... I listen to it all. When I'm not listening to music, you will find me chatting with friends. Off the field, I just let my instincts take over. I certainly don't think about batting, or which bowlers I'm going to face.","I've never fought with anyone. A lot of people talk to me, and they're like, 'Oh, you would have been fighting all the time when you were younger,' but I'm like, 'I never fought with anyone because I always knew that if I hurt myself, I might lose important time in my cricket career,' so I never got into any fight, ever in my life.","I don't believe in signing anything and everything that comes my way. I leave it to my agency to help narrow them down for me, but I do research it myself before signing. The image of the brand and its ambassadors go hand in hand.","As a sportsperson, the best thing is people recognising you and loving you for what you do. For me, glamour is 100 people in the hotel feeling happy to see you.","I don't think there is anything wrong in earning money from the sport you love. If you work hard and get benefits from it, there is no harm. The day you feel that you are not working hard and are only looking at the benefits, that's where the problem is.","The joy of doing well as a batsman for your country is much more than that little joy of going for a party and enjoying music. It is a completely different high, and I get high by performances. That's what I enjoy now.","I wasn't very good in academics, but I could have been if I could have studied well. I was a smart kid.","I don't really focus on these things - on what tags are given to me or what people think of me off the field - stuff like that. My main focus is always to do well on the field for the Indian cricket team. When people say good things about me off the field, I am more than happy to accept them.","I want to be relaxed in my personal life. I really don't like to be hassled.","Endorsements are a reward for good performance on the field, and the commitments made after signing them need to be done.","It undoubtedly feels nice when you are being appreciated and you get complimented by girls. Who doesn't like that? Having said that, I don't take it as any pressure.","I'm not a nerd, don't plan to be a nerd and read books - which I can't do at all.","Whatever I am, it's natural... I don't have to pretend to be aggressive, don't have to show the opposition that I am on the field. Being aggressive comes naturally to me, helps me perform.","I'm a big fan of Aamir Khan... Among actresses, I like Aishwarya Rai.","I always had a sense of discipline in me. However, there was a time when I couldn't divide my time properly between off-field things and on-field assignments. The focus would be missing at times, and that would affect my preparation for matches. I managed to change that.","On the field, aggression can sometimes be a positive emotion. It boosts performance and can lift your game. But over the years, I have learnt that restrained aggression is a better animal. That way, you will conserve your energy and won't spend yourself quickly.","As a kid, I used to see how Sachin Tendulkar used to win matches under pressure for India in Sharjah or other places. So I was always keen to repeat the same in similar situations. I don't take pressure on myself when I am in the middle. I love pressure, and I always believe that pressure makes you more focused.","I feel really blessed when people start comparing me with Sachin, but I keep myself focused on my performance and not on such comparisons. I literally worship him, so I don't see too much in this comparison. No cricketer has been able to score one hundred centuries like Sachin.","My superhero has always been Tendulkar, and it will be Tendulkar for life. He is someone who has inspired me immensely. Just watching him play for India, I used to dream of winning games for India, because he used to do it single handedly."],"Virchand Gandhi":["All religions worthy of the name are now making great efforts to purify their doctrines and return to their original standpoint, all except Christianity! You surely know that the nineteenth century Christianity is not the religion taught by Christ. Christ's religion has been changed and corrupted.","In Western lands there is a distinct division between the religious and the secular life. There is one rule of conduct for laymen and another for clergymen. This distinction has never found its place in the life of the people of India. There, all of life is included in the word 'religion.'","We all understand that the debasement of a nation's coinage is very pernicious and must prove disastrous to its commerce. How much more dangerous is the debasement of the spiritual coinage!","The central ideas of Christianity, an angry God and vicarious atonement, are contrary to every fact in nature, as also to the better aspirations of the human heart; they are, in our present stage of enlightenment, absurd, preposterous, and blasphemous propositions.","Christians well know that the much-decorated statue of the Church, as it now stands, is not of pure chiseled marble, but of clay, cemented together by blood and tears and hardened in the fires of hatred and persecution.","Jainism has two ways of looking at things: one called Dravyarthekaraya and the other Paryayartheka Noya. According to the Dravyarthekaraya view the universe is without beginning and end, but according to the Paryayartheka view we have creation and destruction at every moment.","According to the Jain view, soul is that element which knows, thinks and feels. It is in fact the divine element in the living being. The Jain thinks that the phenomena of knowledge, feeling, thinking and willing are conditioned on something, and that that something must be as real as anything can be.","The true nature of soul is right knowledge, right faith and right conduct. The soul, so long as it is subject to transmigration, is undergoing evolution and involution.","Matter is a term contrary to soul. But nonsoul is its contradictory. Whatever is not soul is nonsoul.","May peace rule the universe, may peace rule in kingdoms and empires, may peace rule in states and in the lands of the potentates, may peace rule in the house of friends and may peace also rule in the house of enemies."],"Virender Sehwag":["Fitness has nothing to do with age.","When I began my life journey, we'd survive on Rs 500 a month as a family. As time passed and I started playing for the country, this Rs 500 multiplied manifold, but it was not the money that mattered: it was the fact that I was fulfilling my ambition of playing cricket on the highest platform, representing my country.","Many stories come from the dressing room that one doesn't speak when you are playing but can do once retired.","Every player has his own mantra of working on his physique.","I lose around a couple of crores every year on the school, but even if I was to make profit from it, I would never use it for myself. I'd plough every penny back into improving facilities for the school. Just as I do with the cricket academies I run around the country. These are not for making money; for that, I have other avenues.","As for my batting, the best part about it is I have never changed it. I have never changed my thinking, I have never changed my batting style.","I would love to be a coach, mentor, or a batting consultant. I would love to commentate in Hindi, as most people who watch the game are more comfortable with Hindi in India rather than English.","My style is my strength. It is my natural game. That is how I grew up and scored most of my runs.","Playing for India was a memorable journey, and I tried to make it more memorable for my team mates and the Indian cricket fans. I believe that I was reasonably successful in doing so.","If you are disciplined, it shows you are organised.","If you know your game, you can handle pressure; you can handle any kind of situation, back yourself, and play your own game and get success.","I batted with contact lenses in the IPL while playing for Delhi Daredevils. I wasn't picking the ball early. So I went back to the glasses.","There are very rare occasions when you get a good wicket to bat on, but whatever wicket you get, you have to play at least 20 overs for your side.","I always tell myself to bat the full day, and if there is a ball to be hit, just hit it.","There are days when you make runs, and there will be a dry spell. Like in business, every year you don't make profits.","Cricketers are worried about their milestones, worried that they should score 5000-10,000 Test runs, but I am not fussy.","Because I knew I had got success at Ranji level, I was confident I would get some success in international cricket too.","The most important thing for any athlete is to know his ability. If you know your ability and have even a little bit of a strong mindset, you can get success, because your ability takes you to success.","To participate in a World Cup is a great honour and achievement. I've played in three World Cups. The whole world watches you during a World Cup and expects you to play innings to win games for your country.","When I was a kid, my first dream was to play Test matches, and the second one was to play 100 Test matches because there are very few people who have played 100 Tests for India.","When a person becomes satisfied, he doesn't run after things, doesn't worry about it, and doesn't make efforts.","I try to hit the ball along the ground, especially against fast bowlers. I also like the bat to come down in the right position and check if my body position is correct. If I'm really watching the ball carefully, then automatically I'm in a good position to hit it down the ground.","In my view, if you have good or bad technique, it doesn't matter. But you will survive if you can adjust your game at international level, you are mentally strong, you know your strengths and how to score runs.","One should always be happy, irrespective of what you achieve in a match or in life. That's how I live my life.","It doesn't matter if you have one billion rupees in your bank account or one rupee. This is one life you get, and you'd rather spend it enjoying whatever you have, rather than thinking, 'Oh, I should have scored seven more runs, or I should get more money.'","When I was growing up, I played a lot of ten- and 12-over games, and I would bat in the middle order. I got only ten-odd balls to face, and I tried to score as much as I could. I applied the same approach in domestic and international cricket, and people were appreciating my strike rate being more than 80 or 90 in Test cricket.","There is no point playing in the IPL when I have retired from international cricket. I did not want a youngster to miss out because of me.","If any IPL team wants me to be a mentor or a batting consultant, I would love to do that. I can share my knowledge with the youngsters.","Every coach desires to bring in his own support staff.","I write what I like. I don't bother what people think about it.","I don't bother about image.","During Rahul Dravid's captaincy, Dhoni got the role of a finisher. He got out a couple of times playing a bad shot, and he was also reprimanded by Dravid during one instance. But from that instance, he completely changed his approach and became a very good finisher.","Only great players can have two shots for one ball, like Tendulkar does, and a big reason is that he picks the ball very early.","I learned from Tendulkar how to get big hundreds.","I have never been able to play consistently with soft hands.","I never thought of breaking a record. The only ambition I had was to become the fastest century maker for India, which I did when I broke Azharuddin's record.","If I had planned to score double and triple hundreds, I would probably not have made them ever.","Once I took to Twitter and shared those jokes, they became a huge hit. My following grew, and some of the posts got thousands of retweets. With so many shares, money from sponsors followed.","Whenever senior players are missing, its ideal for youngsters to avail of these opportunities.","April 2nd is a memorable moment of my cricketing career.","I believe in wishing my colleagues and other celebs in a manner that brings my wit out and gives people a talking point. But there are people who love and those who hate you. That's part of a celeb's life.","I don't know how to troll people, but there are many out there talking with that intent. I just write something funny that would make people laugh.","Someone enjoys your batting, and someone, your humour. Since I'm not batting any longer, I can at least say some words, so people enjoy and give me compliments, too.","My best India v. Pakistan moment is from our first match in the ICC World T20 2007, which was a tie.","When I play a cover-drive, I play it to score runs.","I have matured in my shot selection but will not discard my style. I don't believe in wasting balls.","I curse myself if I get out without making a 100 after crossing 40.","I don't care whether I am politically correct or not when I tweet.","If I feel strongly about something, I don't bother what will people say, especially when it is about the country and the Army. But my cricketer friends are all politically correct when they tweet.","When you start the game, coaches will tell you to do stuff in a particular way, and kids do that. But the moment you start first-class cricket, the coach needs to tell you, 'Try this, try that,' instead of, 'Do this, do that.' If you feel comfortable, you can take it; otherwise, leave it.","I was a middle-order batsman who was too good against spin and hit sixes consistently in Under-19 and Ranji cricket, and I still have the same confidence.","It doesn't matter whether you move your feet or not; if your head is still and body is in balance, you can score lots of runs. This I learned from Tendulkar.","When I faced the likes of Shoaib Akhtar and Brett Lee for the first time, I had a little bit of fear in my mind. My thoughts were, 'Would I be able to face them? Would I be able to play them? Would I be able to hit boundaries?' There were so many questions and fear, also, that if the ball didn't hit my bat, it might hit me on the body.","A youngster should know his game first. If he knows his game, he can modify it at the top level if required. But if he doesn't know his game, then it is difficult to get success at international level. You will get success occasionally but not regularly.","There were a lot of players who gave me suggestions when I was young. At times, they were very good suggestions, and I took them seriously, applied them to my batting, and got success after that.","I love to score runs rather than defending or leaving the ball. That is an important aspect of my batting: I don't want to waste balls in any form of the game.","When I was growing up, we would play a 10-over or 15-over game, and the asking-rate would always be high, and I would end up scoring 30 or 40 runs in 15 balls, so I built that mindset right from the beginning and still continue to bat in the same manner.","During the peak of my career, I used to pick the ball as soon it was released from the bowler's hands. And I hit the ball through the line.","Sometimes, you just need to get out of the game and should do things which you want to do in life and like.","My shot selection has to be good to score big runs.","You don't think of these things when you play. When you retire, you look back and see that my Test average outside Asia is 40, and it is 49 overall. If I can change something, I'd like to change that average outside Asia. I tried as hard as I could outside Asia, but I couldn't do that.","I used to prepare in advance on how the bowler is going to bowl, whether is he going to bowl an outswinger or an inswinger? I used to watch the videos of the bowler and used to prepare in advance.","I thought I could have breached Brian Lara's 400 runs. When I scored 319, I was unbeaten at 309 but then got out. So I think I could have reached that mark, but unfortunately, I missed it.","I would want to change my name to Sachin Tendulkar if I could do it. He has tons of records; I am not even close to him. He is called as the 'God,' and who would not want to be a God in this mortal world?","We never thought that there would be another Sachin Tendulkar. But Virat Kohli has changed this mindset. I think Virat can surpass Tendulkar's records.","Anyone in the game can make any score.","Whenever I have played a game of cricket, whether it is under-16, under-19, or State level, my approach has been the same.","In international cricket, the atmosphere changes, and the interest level is higher, but for a cricketer, it is still a game he has to play.","After you score 300 runs in one innings, you begin to feel that every innings should be close to this one. Of course, I know that won't happen. But I will be disappointed if I get going well and am unable to convert it into a huge score.","As a cricketer, everybody has a dream to play for your country.","When I took up cricket seriously, I wanted to play for India. When my dream was achieved, I thought what next? Then a fellow cricketer told me, 'Playing for India is easy; playing for 10-15 years is difficult.' Then I changed my dream to play 100 Test matches. I achieved that as well. Now there is nothing to achieve, so I am just enjoying things.","Does it make a difference if I score 8000 or 10,000 runs in Test cricket? Not in anybody's life.","I was scared of facing only one bowler - that was Muttiah Muralitharan.","I am the superstitious kind: I never praise a shot because I fear the moment I do so, the batsman gets out.","Sachin Tendulkar was one of the fittest players.","I have a gym at home where I do weight training as well as cardio. I love doing bench press but cannot share information on how much weight I lift. I also practise Yoga. My guru Sadhguru taught me different kriyas like Surya Namaskar, which I do for my personal well being.","I have been successful as an opener, but who knows, maybe I would have been more successful in the middle order.","People say I take too many risks. But the fact is, there is risk involved in every shot. You can get out trying to defend a ball as well.","I think if you think so much, you simply cannot bat.","When I grew up, I tried to score off every ball, be it a 10-over-match, a 20-over, or even a Test match. If I stay in the wicket for, say, about 30 minutes, I want to make the most of it and score maximum runs possible. You never know when you get out; try to score as much possible before that.","I never thought of coaching the Indian cricket team. I was given the offer... BCCI secretary Amitabh Choudhury and MV Sridhar came to me and requested me to think on the offer. I took my time and then applied for the position.","Like life, the beauty of sports is that no two periods are identical.","Experience always enables you to handle pressure better.","Australia always gives a tough fight, and that's why every player wants to perform against Australia. When you perform against Australia, England, and South Africa, you automatically earn more respect.","As an international player, the players have to adapt to the condition no matter what the situation is.","Players like Ravindra Jadeja, Yusuf Pathan, Warner, Glenn Maxwell were noticed at IPL first. It is a platform for players all over the world.","If a player is playing IPL and earning money, it's not his fault that he's not playing for India. He is not quitting. He is playing first-class, one-day cricket and IPL. If selectors don't pick him, what can he do?","There has been the negative impact of spot-fixing and match-fixing, but it is the individual player's responsibility to look after that because if a player wants to do that, it is difficult to stop him. It is the individual player's responsibility to play fairly.","If I do commentary, write articles, or am an expert on a news channel, I can still earn money.","I would never want a guy who is not a natural keeper.","No Indian wants their sports persons to get left behind or any particular sports to get left behind.","It's the duty of the federations to make sure that the funds reach the athletes properly. They need to make sure that the athletes get proper facilities so that they can win the medals for the country.","To say that I wanted to become the captain is entirely incorrect. When Dhoni became captain and I played under him, we won the T20 World Cup.","No doubt, if you go through records, Dhoni is India's best captain to date. Beating Sourav Ganguly, he won the Tests, ODIs, and T20s, won both the World Cups. Nobody can deny that, but to give credit to a single person is not good; others should also get credit for winning the Cups.","To say that the captain makes the team lose or win is not correct.","I don't think it's correct to blame the captain. He at least tries to keep all together so that the team plays well, plays positive cricket, and wins the match for the country, and not think about only winning and earning a name for himself.","God has been kind, and I have done what I wanted to do - on the field and in my life.","I would like to thank all my captains who believed in me and backed me to the hilt. I also thank our greatest partner, the Indian cricket fan, for all the love, support, and memories.","I have lived my dream and played at the finest of cricket grounds across the globe, and I want to thank the groundsmen, clubs, associations, and everyone who painstakingly prepare the arena for our performances.","A sort of sadness shall always remain in my mind that I was not allowed to retire while playing, but anyway, it's all a part of life for a sportsman who, while playing, never realises when he should retire, but he starts thinking about it when he is dropped.","I would like to ask, Should not a player who has played 12 to 13 years for his country deserves a farewell match?","If a player fails to perform in four or five consecutive matches, he should be dropped irrespective of whether he is a senior or a junior player.","I don't like to party. I like to spend time with family on my birthday.","Til the day I didn't play under-19 World Cup, nobody ever celebrated my birthday. And the moment I played for Indian team, my family got excited and ordered and cut a cake for me in front of 40-50 family members.","The officers and jawans of CRPF have sacrificed a lot for the nation.","We don't need to run 5-6 kms, even in a Test match.","My father was a farmer, and we have had some farming land in Haryana. Maybe I would have followed his footsteps and become a farmer.","I have never hidden my injury before, or fitness problems. Even my shoulder operation was planned after consulting the then coach Gary Kirsten and skipper MS Dhoni.","Coach should be a friend, not a coach. And at international level, all you need is a friend who can motivate you. Technique doesn't matter.","If you know how to score runs, you can perform in any format.","Sledging is an important part of the game, but you should never cross the line."],"Virgil Goode":["I don't want to have one currency for all North America.","Obama gave temporary amnesty to well over 1 million illegal immigrants, and Romney said nothing.","We need to stop illegal immigration totally and reduce legal immigration and end the diversity visas policy pushed hard by President Clinton and allowing many persons from the Middle East to come to this country.","One: balance the budget now, not later. Two: Get Americans jobs by ending illegal immigration and making legal immigration harder. Lastly: Impose term limits.","There's a huge cost that comes with illegal immigration.","It's time for grassroots citizens to have a president that's focused on them rather than the super PACs.","I can tell you, if I'm elected president, it won't be on the Koran, and it won't be on the Book of Mormon.","It is important that the United States move with all deliberate speed to develop and get into usage alternative fuels that will allow us to end our dependence on foreign oil.","In my almost ten years in the House of Representatives, I have voted consistently to allow companies to drill for oil and natural gas in environmentally friendly ways.","You've just got to be honest and straightforward.","I think citizenship should count for something... and it really counts for nothing.","In addition, the bill passed by the House requires a person performing an abortion on a minor from a different state to notify one parent in the home state.","It is a sign of the times that the absence of meaningful ID requirements in many states leaves our voting process vulnerable to fraud and allows legal votes to be cancelled out by illegally cast ballots.","The fact that the price of gasoline has declined some in recent weeks must not allow Americans to be lulled into a false sense of security. Energy independence must rank along with border security as the top priorities of the United States.","Even as we work to develop more sources of petroleum for the United States, we must continue our vigorous pursuit of alternative fuels, so that we can be powered by cleaner, more efficient sources of energy.","Only in the last week, South Carolina announced that it is seeking to become the U. S. center for hydrogen fuel cells, and BMW revealed that it will power some of its high-end model cars with hydrogen.","Further, the United States is moving ahead in the development of clean coal technology. There are vast coal reserves in our country, and when it is burned cleanly, coal can provide a resource to supply a large amount of our energy requirements.","However, it may occur that we will find ourselves using a variety of fuel sources to give us the energy we need support our lifestyles and boost our economy.","In general, anyone who paid the long distance telephone tax will get the refund on their 2006 federal income tax return. This includes individuals, businesses and non-profit organizations.","All of us who serve in the House of Representatives and the Senate pay into Social Security.","The salary of a member of Congress ends the day that he of she leaves office.","The retirement system that is in place for members of Congress and other federal workers features what is known as the Federal Employment Retirement Plan.","In my case, I pay a standard premium to participate in the Federal Employees' Health Benefits Plan for my wife and myself out of each month's paycheck.","The progress in Iraq has not been without cost.","We have indeed been fortunate in this country. Over the last 200 some odd years since our Nation was founded, rarely have there been attacks upon our homeland.","We need to thank all of our troops, and particularly those for whom we can never express enough gratitude for they have given their lives so that all of us may be free and that our democracy can be a shining light for the rest of the world.","If the massive invasion is not stopped, we are going to be flooded to the extent that we will drift into third world status. For our children and for our grandchildren, we cannot fail on this issue.","Amnesty is the magnet. Other magnets that you mentioned are anchor babies who get benefits in this country and employer deductions for employees, even if they are here illegally, which Mr. King is addressing.","For more than two centuries, the defenders of liberty have put their lives on the line, because they have known that we cannot take our freedoms for granted.","As the American public continues to focus more intensely on illegal immigration and securing the nation's borders, the number of members of the House Immigration Reform Caucus continues to grow.","The average citizen saw that the big PACs with the billionaires and the multimillionaires get what they want in Washington, but the average citizen is left behind.","When I raise my hand to take the oath on Swearing In Day, I will have the Bible in my other hand. I do not subscribe to using the Koran in any way.","The Muslim Representative from Minnesota was elected by the voters of that district, and if American citizens don't wake up and adopt the Virgil Goode position on immigration, there will likely be many more Muslims elected to office and demanding the use of the Koran.","A Muslim student came by the office and asked why I did not have anything on my wall about the Koran. My response was clear, 'As long as I have the honor of representing the citizens of the 5th District of Virginia in the United States House of Representatives, the Koran is not going to be on the wall of my office.'","A lot of disgruntled Democrats that don't like Obama - old-line Democrats, some of them even conservative - will never vote for a Republican ticket, but they will vote for me as an independent.","Printed media and other media indicated that Mr. Ellison was going to use the Koran, and that generated scores and hundreds of emails to my office. And so I thought it very important to state my view. And my view is that I don't subscribe to the Koran, and I will now be using the Bible when I take the oath.","You won't hear the leadership in the Republican Party admit it, but there are many in the House and Senate who know that illegal immigration has to be stopped and legal immigration has to be reduced. We are giving away the country so a few very rich people can get richer.","The Bush administration as well as Mexico and Canada have persons in the government in all three countries who want to a see a North American Union as well as a highway system that would bring goods into the west coast of Mexico and transport them up through Mexico into the United States and then in onto Canada.","Some really large businesses that get a lot from China would like a NAFTA Superhighway system because it would reduce costs for them to transport containers from China and, as a result, increase their margins.","I am vigorously opposed to the Mexican trucks coming into the country. The way we have done it and, I think, the way we should do it in the future, is to have the goods come into the United States from Mexico within a 20-mile commercial space and unloaded from Mexican trucks into U.S. trucks.","We can stay in Afghanistan and the Middle East forever, and it won't make a difference.","I still believe to some degree that Iraq had WMD.","Send Iran a clear message that if we are assaulted, we will meet it and trump it.","I fear that in the next century we will have many more Muslims in the United States if we do not adopt the strict immigration policies that I believe are necessary to preserve the values and beliefs traditional to the United States of America and to prevent our resources from being swamped.","It's time we had a president who stood up for American workers first.","We don't need to bring 100,000 refugees in from the Middle East.","Trump has the courage to stand up to Wall Street, to the K Street lobbyists, and say our trade deals have not been best for the ordinary, average citizen American.","The establishment will do all they can to block him, so grassroots America's going to have to turn out in droves for Mr. Trump.","I think most people have a general idea of the Constitution, and somewhat of the Bill of Rights.","I say if you are here illegally and are displaying and waving the Mexican flag, you should go back to Mexico and fly that flag there.","I support our country being our country.","I would submit a balanced budget if elected president, and it would be painful.","Seniors are concerned about Medicare and Social Security. I advocated in Congress a separate and distinct lockbox fund for Social Security.","We shouldn't bring in foreign workers to do jobs that belong to U.S. citizens.","Romney says he loves immigration.","The anchor baby situation has got to stop.","I wish more people would take a stand and stand up for the principles on which this country was founded.","If I'm fortunate enough to get the nomination of the Constitution Party, I will take as many votes from Obama as I would from the Republican nominee.","We really don't have much of a choice between Obama and Romney. Neither one of them are for Medicare or taking the steps that's needed for jobs in America.","It's a very distinct difference between Romney and Obama and myself.","The Founding Fathers had just four Cabinet departments and the postmaster general.","The voters of each Congressional district select the representative that they choose to represent them, and perhaps voters in all districts will now ask prospective candidates whether they will use the Bible, the Koran, or anything else.","That would be the biggest shake-up Washington ever had, if big money didn't dictate who the candidates were and who got elected.","You can't keep bringing people in from other countries, finding them jobs when Americans need jobs first.","Every company that comes into the office for appropriations, the first thing I ask is how many jobs are you going to bring to the 5th District that are not already there.","The difference between Obama and Romney is the difference between tweedledum and tweedledee.","I'm for making sure Americans get jobs before other people do, and I'm not going to let jobs get outsourced overseas, like Romney let happen.","We should do what Obama and Romney won't do: Concentrate on Americans.","Both Obama and Romney are just rolling in PAC money. Plus, they have the super PAC's behind them. They've got multi-millionaires and billionaires just buying 30-second ads. It gives each of them tremendous exposure.","Government cannot ensure equal results because every individual differs.","Success is measured differently by different people.","The biggest problem with the deficit is programs that are unconstitutional and wasteful.","Taxes should be simple and fair... I'm not for increasing income taxes - if we even have an income tax.","I'm a conservative, but with a focus on average people. For instance, I support Social Security and Medicare.","I'm for a balanced budget now.","You shouldn't have political action committees.","I do not love immigration. I think immigration has been harmful to the United States. I think it's brought more persons more dependent on the government into this country.","I just wish that more people would be welcoming to dogs and cats so they didn't have so many that got killed and had to be thrown in a landfill.","We need to preserve jobs in America for American citizens first, and none of the other presidential candidates are - are addressing this issue. It's not politically correct, but it is one thing we could do right away to have jobs in America for American citizens first.","We can have more jobs in small businesses if 'Obamacare' is eliminated.","What we have are - some of the big political donors behind the super PACs are big on promoting more of these trade agreements which cost us jobs - another reason that we need to end political action committees and have only individual donations with their donations being disclosed completely with names and addresses and other information.","If you are in this country illegally, stealing a job from an American citizen, I'm going to do all I can to put an American citizen in that job and not somebody that has crossed our border, come into the country and violated our laws.","I talk to a lot of those voters who say, 'Just give us another choice.'"],"Virgil Thomson":["Let your mind alone, and see what happens.","I never learned to verbalize an abstract musical concept. No thank you. The whole point of being a serious musician is to avoid verbalization whenever you can.","Reviewing music or reviewing anything is a writing job. It's nice if you are experienced in the field you are writing about, but writing is what you are doing.","I said to my friends that if I was going to starve, I might as well starve where the food is good.","You explain how it went, and as far as you can figure out how it got that way.","I don't care what other critics say, I only hope to be played.","I've never known a musician who regretted being one. Whatever deceptions life may have in store for you, music itself is not going to let you down.","I don't go around regretting things that don't happen.","I look at you and I write down what I hear.","I don't have to worry No matter what they do to it, it works.","Musicians own music because music owns them.","In Paris, you learn wit, in London you learn to crush your social rivals, and in Florence you learn poise.","Try a thing you haven't done three times.

And a third time to figure out whether you like it or not."],"Virgil":["It never troubles the wolf how many the sheep may be.","Time flies never to be recalled.","They can conquer who believe they can.","Come what may, all bad fortune is to be conquered by endurance.","Every calamity is to be overcome by endurance.","There's a snake lurking in the grass.","But meanwhile time flies; it flies never to be regained.","Time passes irrevocably.","Fortune favours the bold.","Hug the shore; let others try the deep.","Time is flying never to return.","Endure the present, and watch for better things.","Fortune sides with him who dares.","It is easy to go down into Hell; night and day, the gates of dark Death stand wide; but to climb back again, to retrace one's steps to the upper air - there's the rub, the task.","Go forth a conqueror and win great victories.","Confidence cannot find a place wherein to rest in safety.","Even virtue is fairer when it appears in a beautiful person.","All things deteriorate in time.","None but himself can be his parallel.","We can't all do everything.","They can because they think they can.","Happy is he who can trace effects to their causes.","Let not our proposal be disregarded on the score of our youth.","Happy the man who has been able to learn the causes of things.","Mind moves matter.","As the twig is bent the tree inclines.","Love conquers all.","Fate will find a way.","All our sweetest hours fly fastest.","Persevere and preserve yourselves for better circumstances.","Every man makes a god of his own desire.","They succeed, because they think they can.","Trust not too much to appearances.","Your descendants shall gather your fruits.","Perhaps the day may come when we shall remember these sufferings with joy.","Consider what each soil will bear, and what each refuses.","One man excels in eloquence, another in arms.","Yield not to calamity, but face her boldly.","From my example learn to be just, and not to despise the gods.","Who asks whether the enemy was defeated by strategy or valor?","Perhaps even these things, one day, will be pleasing to remember.","Age carries all things away, even the mind.","He like a rock in the sea unshaken stands his ground.","If one swain scorns you, you will soon find another.","The descent to the infernal regions is easy enough, but to retrace one's steps, and reach the air above, there's the rub.","From one learn all.","The medicine increases the disease.","The world cares very little about what a man or woman knows; it is what a man or woman is able to do that counts.","They are able because they think they are able.","Trust one who has tried.","Love begets love, love knows no rules, this is same for all.","Do not yield to misfortunes, but advance more boldly to meet them, as your fortune permits you.","A fault is fostered by concealment.","He enters the port with a full sail.","Each of us bears his own Hell.","Better times perhaps await us who are now wretched.","Every sound alarms.","I shudder when relating it.","In strife who inquires whether stratagem or courage was used?","Myself acquainted with misfortune, I learn to help the unfortunate.","Passion and strife bow down the mind.","There should be no strife with the vanquished or the dead.","Veiling truth in mystery.","Want of pluck shows want of blood.","Their rage supplies them with weapons.","What region of the earth is not full of our calamities?","If ye despise the human race, and mortal arms, yet remember that there is a God who is mindful of right and wrong.","What each man feared would happen to himself, did not trouble him when he saw that it would ruin another.","The only safety for the conquered is to expect no safety.","I fear the Greeks, even when they bring gifts.","Wherever the fates lead us let us follow.","Cease to think that the decrees of the gods can be changed by prayers.","To have died once is enough.","Fury itself supplies arms.","Who can blind lover's eyes?","Age steals away all things, even the mind.","Fear is proof of a degenerate mind.","O accursed hunger of gold, to what dost thou not compel human hearts!"],"Virginia Euwer Wolff":["Shakespeare had found language for the agony of living with one's own mistakes. There were words for finding yourself isolated with your failures. Phrases for discovering that you were wrong, all, all wrong, wrong, wrong.","No one writes as slowly as I do, I'm convinced. It's so hard for me. I learn slowly; I make decisions at a snail's pace.","After clearing the land, planting the orchard, building the house and barn, and surviving the Great Depression, our father died suddenly one winter night when we were small, leaving us to learn about loss before we even knew its name.","I grew up in rural Oregon in a log house with bark left on inside and out. We had no electricity, a massive stone fireplace, a grand piano, and tons of books.","As authors evolve and try to trace the precedents that have shaped their work, it sometimes becomes a matter of identifying the shadowy figure in the back row of the mental photograph, or of grabbing at the tail of a memory that's just slipping out the window into thin air.","My mother had no idea that her daughter would turn out to be a writer, but she would not let me go through a day of my childhood without music.","It's true that I had a bucolic, truly peaceful childhood, growing up in a house next to our family's orchard. We had a lot of books and art, but no electricity until I was eight years old. Since then, I have seen a lot of inner-city life, though.","Reviewers have called my books 'novels in verse.' I think of them as written in prose, but I do use stanzas. Stanza means 'room' in Latin, and I wanted there to be 'room' - breathing opportunities to receive thoughts and have time to come out of them before starting again at the left margin.","I've followed Brenda Bowen as she's moved from Henry Holt to Scholastic to Simon and Schuster to Hyperion and to HarperCollins. I have complete confidence that Brenda always knows the right questions to ask. I'm not sure another editor would be able to do that.","Most people I know don't even realize I'm an award-winning author, but I have gotten many opportunities to travel to places I'd never have visited otherwise.","I work early in the morning, before my nasty critic gets up - he rises about noon. By then, I've put in much of a day's work.","We're so mixed up about religion in this culture. We say the Pledge of Allegiance, 'under God indivisible,' but there's no prayer in the schools. I would be so untethered without my personal faith. I wouldn't be able to go through a day - but that's my own experience.","The teenage years are the years to examine faith - the need to be independent and the need to be anchored. Who made all this? And what do I have to do with it?"],"Virginia Foxx":["The American flag is the most recognized symbol of freedom and democracy in the world.","So why in the world would anyone support the unethical, failed use of embryonic stem cells instead of the ethical, successful use of adult stem cells? Because they do not know the difference.","Our brave soldiers and support personnel are engaged in a battle as important as any the United States has ever before waged, for the success of democracy in Iraq is a crucial test of the ideals this Nation was founded upon.","From a parent's right to know what their children are doing, to protecting citizens across the country from the growing threat of gang violence, the House Democrat leadership is simply out to lunch.","The number of kids affected by obesity has tripled since 1980, and this can be traced in large part to lack of exercise and a healthy diet.","If we do not make tough decisions now, future Americans will have to make even tougher ones.","There is an abundance of misinformation, exaggeration, and blatant lies being spread by interest groups regarding the prospects for embryonic stem cell research.","Challenging unfairly subsidized products, fighting counterfeit goods and intellectual property theft and holding countries accountable for an unfair currency regime will help American companies remain competitive.","China is crippling our manufacturing economy and eliminating our jobs by illegally flooding our markets.","China's idea of fair trade is government subsidies of its textile and apparel exports to the United States, currency manipulation, and forgiveness of loans by its government banks.","Obesity among young Americans is a serious problem that can have serious ramifications in the long run.","Republicans are pushing legislation forward that will improve the effectiveness of and bring more accountability to U.S. foreign assistance around the world and bring democracy even further into the light.","This is my first term. I was told it was going to be an exciting term, and a lot of things would be done, and I cannot think about something more exciting than save Social Security.","The life expectancy is much longer today than it was when Social Security was created.","I like the idea of giving workers control and putting their money into their personal accounts.","In the face of terrorism, a united front is one of the strongest weapons.","A terrorist network that believes a nation so tested will fold under pressure of a few horrific acts may capture its attention, but will not achieve its submission.","America does not fight for land, glory or riches.","Liberty is not the unique right of Americans or even Westerners, but is mankind's right.","We remain in Iraq because we know that sometimes liberty needs some nursing before it can grow on its own.","In times of war, it is often best to look to our history to see how past generations of Americans dealt with the loss of their countrymen in just causes.","Democrats believe they can win at the ballot box by obstructing, and they would rather win the next election than move America forward.","One poll shows that by 61 percent to 29 percent Americans under 40 say that Social Security needs to be fixed.","Democrat leaders are not only out of the American mainstream, but are also out of the Democratic mainstream.","The American people must not buy into the Democrat rhetoric.","The first misconception is that embryonic stem cell research is not legal. The fact is, embryonic stem cell research is completely legal. Research on embryonic stem cells has taken place for years.","A stem cell is essentially a blank cell capable of becoming another, more differentiated cell-type in the body, such as a skin cell, a muscle cell or a nerve cell.","Adult stem cells tend not to form tumors."],"Virginia Gildersleeve":["I was resolved to sustain and preserve in my college the bite of the mind, the chance to stand face to face with truth, the good life lived in a small, various, highly articulate and democratic society.","The ability to think straight, some knowledge of the past, some vision of the future, some skill to do useful service, some urge to fit that service into the well-being of the community - these are the most vital things education must try to produce."],"Virginia Graham":["Good shot, bad luck and hell are the five basic words to be used in a game of tennis, though these, of course, can be slightly amplified.","Be blind. Be stupid. Be British. Be careful."],"Virginia Henley":["I was born in England and went to school there. That's when I discovered my undying passion for history - not just for the Middle Ages, but all periods of history. My favorites are medieval, Elizabethan, and Georgian; however, I've written stories set in periods as early as ancient Rome, right up to the Victorian era.","In 1976, I read a book by Kathleen E. Woodiwiss and knew immediately that I, too, could write a historical romance. It took me a year to complete the manuscript. I was a forty-year-old Scarborough housewife who knew no one in publishing.","History is my passion. So I write what I love to read. I find that if I combine history with a strong, sensual romance, it is like a one-two punch. The reader doesn't want the history without the romance, and of course the heavier the history, the more it has to be leavened with a sensual, all-consuming love story.","To have a successful writing career, you must be willing to sacrifice a great deal. The book, the deadline come first before anything else. Writing is not a job; it is a lifestyle, and it is a roller-coaster ride of highs and lows. You need self-confidence and an iron carapace.","Probably every book I read influenced me in some small way. Authors like Jan Westcott, Kathleen Winsor, Catherine Cookson, Georgette Heyer, and even Barbara Cartland taught me to write character-driven stories.","I first started writing historical fiction in the late '70s and kept pictures of Kathleen Woodiwiss and Rosemary Rogers on my refrigerator until my first book was published by Avon in 1982. The biggest advantage of this genre for me is that it allows me to blend fact and fiction.","I love to have real people of history interact with my fictional characters. History gives me the plot. I research the period meticulously, and then I blend in a romantic and sensual love story to give it balance. The heavier the history, the more romantic the couple must be.","I have always been drawn to the Restoration period of Charles II. I have a soft spot for Charles Stuart, who was always loving and kind to the opposite sex. The members of his court were fascinating, and Barbara Castlemaine was one of the greatest courtesans in history.","'The Irish Duke' is a sequel to 'The Decadent Duke' about Lady Georgina Gordon who married the Duke of Bedford. 'The Irish Duke' tells the story of their daughter, Lady Louisa, who married James Hamilton, the powerful and wealthy Duke of Abercorn.","I did a great deal of research to write 'The Irish Duke.' Since all the people in this Lords of the Realm series are real historical characters, everything had to be authentic. I researched Woburn Abbey, where my heroine lived, and everything about Barons Court in Ireland, which was the ancestral home of Abercorn.","I begin early in the morning and edit everything I wrote the previous day. I write until mid-afternoon. My goal is to write a chapter per week, and if I am not finished by Friday, I write on the weekend. I get a lot of fan emails and answer them every day. In the late afternoon, I attend to the business of publishing, etc.","I love to read history books, which is where I get my ideas. I also read historical romance for pleasure.","It was an easy decision for me which books to self-publish as ebooks. I got the rights back to two Avon books that I wrote at the start of my career. I paid to have these two books, 'Bold Conquest' and 'Wild Hearts,' scanned. When I got them back as documents, I had to clean them up and correct all the typos, etc.","I devour history books. I love anything by Thomas B. Costain or George MacDonald Fraser. He writes magnificent history, and he also wrote the Flashman stories, which are irresistible."],"Virginia Hey":["It's scary for me to act. It's terrifying. But I must be addicted to the adrenaline rush of the fear. It's like bungee jumping, I suppose. But after I accomplish it, I get this great sense of satisfaction and an overwhelming feeling of well being.","I like the beach and would also love to learn golf because I think it is rather elegant for an older lady.","When I was younger, my mum used to put fresh flowers in bath water instead of rubber ducks, and since then I had a love of perfumes."],"Virginia Johnson":["Sure! Why should any experts be the arbiters... That's like telling someone they can't be a vegetarian.","In an area where nothing was known, medicine had to draw on social lore.","We're born man, woman and sexual beings.","We learn our sexual preferences and orientations."],"Virginia Madsen":["Men, we don't need you to be a knight in shining armor. We just need you to be a little bit brave, just a little bit. And some of them are, and that's what he does.","To me it meant, just looking at it from a Maya point of view, it meant that Paul Miles is always moving laterally in his life. And she just wants him to take a couple of steps forward, you know?","You know, we're not on stage, we're not doing a play, so we don't have a relationship with the audience but going through that process and also just hearing how much people love the film, you feel like you do have a relationship with the audience.","I have good genes. My father is Danish and my mother is Irish and Native American. They both have good skin.","I spend a lot of time at my son's school and I really wanted to do a movie that the kids could see. The good thing about being my age and not having to be the ingenue anymore is that I get to be a mom. I get to have kids in my movies.","Our audience is all the girls who made Britney a huge star. Those are the girls who bought the book. I didn't read the book at first. I read the script just to see what I would think of the script and I really liked it.","I hope Britney doesn't get bummed out that Lindsey is a better singer. It is not Lindsey saying it, it's me. Lindsey would never say that. She's an actress first. It's just a bonus that she can dance and sing."],"Virginia Postrel":["European nations began World War I with a glamorous vision of war, only to be psychologically shattered by the realities of the trenches. The experience changed the way people referred to the glamour of battle; they treated it no longer as a positive quality but as a dangerous illusion.","Airline glamour never promised anything as mundane as elbow room, much less a flat bed, a massage, or an arugula salad. It promised a better world. Service and dress reflected the more formal era, but no one expected air travel to be comfortable. It was amazing just to have hot food above the clouds.","Rich people in poor places want to show off their wealth. And their less affluent counterparts feel pressure to fake it, at least in public. Nobody wants the stigma of being thought poor.","Glamour invites us to live in a different world. It has to simultaneously be mysterious, a little bit distant - that's why, often in these glamour shots, the person is not looking at the audience, it's why sunglasses are glamorous - but also not so far above us that we can't identify with the person.","The elements that create glamour are not specific styles - bias-cut gowns or lacquered furniture - but more general qualities: grace, mystery, transcendence. To the right audience, Halle Berry is more glamorous commanding the elements as Storm in the X-Men movies than she is walking the red carpet in a designer gown.","Like the skyscraper, the automobile, and the motion-picture palace, neon signs once symbolized popular hopes for a new era of technological achievement and commercial abundance. From the 1920s to the 1950s, neon-lit streets pulsed with visual excitement from Vancouver to Miami.","In Shakespeare's world, characters cannot trust their senses. Is the ghost in Hamlet true and truthful, or is it a demon, tempting young Hamlet into murderous sin? Is Juliet dead or merely sleeping? Does Lear really stand at the edge of a great cliff? Or has the Fool deceived him to save his life?","Society needs both parents and nonparents, both the work party and the home party. While raising children is the most important work most people will do, not everyone is cut out for parenthood. And, as many a childless teacher has proved, raising kids is not the only important contribution a person can make to their future.","Religion, art, and science flourish best in a free society. True, freedom does not afford much opportunity for grand gestures. It has little room for martyrs. But life is not supposed to be about dying well. It is about living well.","The Elgin Marbles were supposed to be on the Parthenon. For many works of art, a museum is an artificial setting - a zoo, not a natural habitat.","Most of us cluster somewhere in the middle of most statistical distributions. But there are lots of bell curves, and pretty much everyone is on a tail of at least one of them. We may collect strange memorabilia or read esoteric books, hold unusual religious beliefs or wear odd-sized shoes, suffer rare diseases or enjoy obscure movies.","Science is about exploring the unknown and cannot offer guarantees.","Clothing creates the illusion that bodies fit an aesthetically pleasing norm. And that illusion depends on getting the fit right. Garments that bunch, pull, or sag call attention to figure flaws and often make people look worse than they would without clothes.","Like the rest of the genetic lottery, beauty is unfair. Everyone falls short of perfection, but some are luckier than others. Real confidence requires self-knowledge, which includes recognizing one's shortcomings as well as one's strengths.","The SAT is not perfect. We all know smart, knowledgeable people who do badly on standardized tests. But neither is it useless. SAT scores do measure both specific knowledge and valuable thinking skills.","By reshaping or decorating our outer selves, we express our inner sense of self: 'I like that' becomes 'I'm like that.'","Glamour is not something you possess but something you perceive, not something you have but something you feel. It is a subjective response to a stimulus.","The definition of an 'operating system' is bound to evolve with customer demands and technological possibilities.","Socialism is about claims of justice, and it is also about money: about wealth, income, physical and financial capital. It is an ideology based on allocating economic resources. It may try to achieve that goal by nationalizing assets, by command-and-control regulation, or by taxation and redistribution.","Glamour is a beautiful illusion - the word 'glamour' originally meant a literal magic spell - that promises to transcend ordinary life and make the ideal real. It depends on a special combination of mystery and grace. Too much information breaks the spell.","Persuasion has become a kind of force. The more the advertiser knows about what consumers want, and the more desires the product and packaging seek to fulfill, the more coercive the force.","Apple doesn't need to maximize book sales. It simply needs to keep publishers happy enough to maintain an impressive-sounding inventory of titles while waiting for entirely new forms of publishing to develop.","Medicare is a monopoly: a central-planning bureaucracy grafted onto American health care. It exercises a stranglehold on the health care of all Americans over 65, and on the medical practices of almost all physicians. Medicare decides what is legitimate and what is not: which prices may be charged and which services may be rendered.","The children who are 'our future' will inherit a world created not just by parental devotion but by the sort of zealous, focused endeavors that can preclude good parenting.","Glamour is an imaginative process that creates a specific emotional response: a sharp mixture of projection, longing, admiration, and aspiration. It evokes an audience's hopes and dreams and makes them seem attainable, all the while maintaining enough distance to sustain the fantasy.","In mid-July 2007, after a routine mammogram, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. As cancer diagnoses go, mine wasn't particularly scary. The affected area was small, and the surgeon seemed to think that a lumpectomy followed by radiation would eradicate the cancerous tissue.","Unlike painting, sculpture, or music, typefaces must be useful to someone. Fortunately for designers, the digital age has produced new problems to solve - developing typefaces that work on mobile phones, for one - and enabled better solutions to old problems.","Standardized sizes made inexpensive, off-the-rack garments economically feasible. They gave shoppers a reliable guide to finding clothes in self-service shops.","The glamour of twentieth-century air travel helped to persuade once-fearful travelers to take to the skies and encouraged parochial Americans to go out and see the world.","Traditional PCs face competition from specialty products like Palm Pilots and from the servers that provide the nodes in computer networks. Microsoft's Windows CE hasn't done too well in the specialty-device market, and its Windows NT faces strong competition for server customers.","The goal of socialism is a fairer allocation of economic resources, which its advocates often claim will also be a less wasteful one. Socialism is about who gets the goods and how. Socialism objects to markets because markets allocate resources in ways socialists believe to be unfair on both counts: both the who and the how.","The biggest threat to a better life is the desire to keep the future under control - to make the world predictable by reining in creativity and enterprise. Progress as a neat blueprint, with no deviations and no surprise, may work in children's cartoons or utopian novels. But it's just a fantasy.","Abundant choice doesn't force us to look for the absolute best of everything. It allows us to find the extremes in those things we really care about, whether that means great coffee, jeans cut wide across the hips, or a spouse who shares your zeal for mountaineering, Zen meditation, and science fiction.","We know beauty when we see it, and our reactions are remarkably consistent. Beauty is not just a social construct, and not every girl is beautiful just the way she is.","We know we need bosses and deadlines to help us get work done. But sometimes we can also use an external push to make us have a good time. In both cases, our future self will appreciate the help.","Americans born since World War II have grown up in a media-saturated environment. From childhood, we have developed a sort of advertising literacy, which combines appreciation for technique with skepticism about motives. We respond to ads with at least as much rhetorical intelligence as we apply to any other form of persuasion.","'The Matrix' is a movie that is all about glamour. I could do a whole talk on 'The Matrix' and glamour. It was criticized for glamorizing violence, because, look - sunglasses and those long coats, and, of course, they could walk up walls and do all these kinds of things that are impossible in the real world.","Living with a single kidney is almost exactly like living with two; the remaining kidney expands to take up the slack. (When kidneys fail, they generally fail together; barring trauma or cancer, there's not much advantage to a backup.) The main risk to the donor is the risk of any surgery.","If you default on your Visa bill, nobody comes to repossess your refrigerator or auction off your shoes. The biggest penalty you'll face is trouble getting future credit.","Like John Kennedy in 1960, Obama combines youth, vigor, and good looks with the promise of political change. Like Kennedy, he grew up in unusual circumstances that distance him from ordinary American life.","At the basic consumer level, the profusion of fonts appeals to a culture that celebrates expressive individualism.","Scientists appear most often in horror movies. Through childlike curiosity or God-defying hubris, they unleash destructive forces they can't control - 'Forbidden Planet's Monsters of the Id.","Cosmetics makers have always sold 'hope in a jar' - creams and potions that promise youth, beauty, sex appeal, and even love for the women who use them.","Neon signs don't consume much power, but they look like they do. A cousin of fluorescent lighting, neon is actually quite energy efficient. A neon tube glows coolly when high-voltage, low-amperage electrical power excites the gas within it.","By binding image and desire, glamour gives us pleasure, even as it heightens our yearning. It leads us to feel that the life we dream of exists, and to desire it even more.","America is a mosaic not of groups but of individuals, each of whom carries a host of cultural influences, some chosen, some inherited, some absorbed by osmosis. That mosaic is held together by the pursuit of happiness, the most powerful mortar ever conceived. Left alone, it will long endure.","A world of few choices, whether in jeans or mates, is a world in which individual differences become sources of alienation, unhappiness, even self-loathing. If no jeans fit, you'll feel uncomfortable or inferior. If no housing developments reflect your taste for unique architecture, you'll write screeds against philistine mass culture.","Our demand for good looks, expressed in the biting comments that ensue when public figures fall short of perfection, puts enormous pressures on these individuals and may screen out the otherwise qualified. If video killed the radio star, it may also be doing away with the homely politician.","The United States government approaches patient choice in medication as Singapore does free speech: its pronouncements sound reasonable and tolerant until you threaten its prerogatives.","A lot of consumers actively enjoy advertising, especially fashion print ads and clever TV commercials. The nostalgic cable channel TVLand features not only vintage shows but also vintage commercials.","The innovative process is a fragile one, dependent on a complex, often messy interplay of imagination, competition, and exchange. Curbing new ideas hurts not only individual creators but the audience for which they create and the posterity that inherits their legacy.","Cable companies aren't bad because they're parts of unwieldy media conglomerates. They're bad because they're monopolies (even where they are no longer legally exclusive) and because the government policies that made them monopolies rewarded lobbying over customer service.","There's a popular saying that the Internet interprets censorship as damage and routes around it. Desire and innovation will trump policy, the argument goes, as clever programmers circumvent controls.","Kidney donors don't have to be close relatives of recipients, but they do need to have the right blood type. And kidneys from living donors tend to last many years longer than kidneys from deceased donors.","For designers, the rigidity of an alphabet presents a never-ending artistic challenge: How do you do something new and still preserve the letters' essential forms?","Chains do more than bargain down prices from suppliers or divide fixed costs across a lot of units. They rapidly spread economic discovery - the scarce and costly knowledge of what retail concepts and operational innovations actually work.","When 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' premiered on the WB Network in 1996, American culture was in trouble. Americans were bowling alone, pursuing individual interests to the detriment of the communal good. Business leaders were celebrating creativity and neglecting discipline. Nike's 'Just do it' ads were teaching young people to break the rules.","Glamour is all about transcending this world and getting to an idealized, perfect place. And this is one reason that modes of transportation tend to be extremely glamorous. The less experience we have with them, the more glamorous they are. So you can do a glamorized picture of a car, but you can't do a glamorized picture of traffic.","I think glamour has a genuine appeal, has a genuine value. I'm not against glamour. But there's a kind of wonder in the stuff that gets edited away in the cords of life.","The common intuition is that e-books should be cheap because they aren't physical - no printing, no shipping.","Dialysis does not make patients well. It simply postpones their deaths.","Kidney disease is a low-profile, unglamorous problem, a disease that disproportionately strikes minorities and the poor. Its celebrity spokesman is blue-collar comedian George Lopez, who received a kidney from his wife.","Like Disneyland, luxury retailers have long had to figure out how to overcome customers' natural inertia. Unlike less pricey stores, they tend not to attract idle browsers who make impulse purchases.","The intimate contest for self-command never ends, and lifetime happiness requires finding the right balance between present impulses and future well-being.","As a general rule, durable-goods production tends to be the most volatile sector of the economy. Since people usually have a stock of durables in use, when times get tight, they put off new purchases. What seem like small cutbacks to the end buyer translate into big swings for the producer.","As discomfiting as it is to both market optimists and policy activists, a certain amount of instability is inherent to the economy.","The growth of medical expenditures in the U.S. is not caused by administrative costs but by increases in the technical intensity of care over time - a.k.a. medical progress.","The evergreen story of people in debt becomes even sexier in an economic downturn, when debts inevitably get harder to pay.","As borrowers, we may feel guilty about running up debt, anxious about making payments, and resentful of the constraints that old obligations (and old credit records) impose on our current choices. We may find it too easy to buy things we may later regret.","When credit is cheaper to use and easier to arrange, people do use more of it.","In a media culture, we not only judge strangers by how they look but by the images of how they look. So we want attractive pictures of our heroes and repulsive images of our enemies.","Barack Obama has brought glamour back to American politics - not the faux glamour-by-association of campaigning with movie stars or sailing with the Kennedys, but the real thing. The candidate himself is glamorous. Audiences project onto him the personal qualities and political positions they want in a president.","In post-Vietnam, post-Watergate America, skeptical voters demand full disclosure of everything from candidates' finances to their medical records, and spin-savvy accounts of backstage machinations dominate political coverage.","We've gone from a world in which Starbucks set a cutting-edge standard for mass-market design to a world in which Starbucks establishes the bare minimum. If your establishment can't come up with an original look, customers expect at least some sleek wood fixtures, nicely upholstered chairs, and faux-Murano glass pendant lights.","When Baby Boomer women started choosing hotel-like birthing centers over hospital delivery rooms, hospitals quickly wised up. Now even rural hospitals offer well-designed labor-delivery-recovery suites.","The profusion of fonts is one more product of the digital revolution. Beginning in the mid-'80s and accelerating in the 1990s, type design weathered the sort of radical, technology-driven transformation that other creative industries, including music, publishing, and movies, now face.","Though designed as a mere convenience, clothing sizes establish an unintended norm, an ideal from which deviations seem like flaws. There's nothing like a trip to the dressing room to convince a woman - fat, thin, or in between - that she's a freak.","Fit experts envision a future in which you'd carry your body scan in your cell phone or on a thumb drive, using the data to order clothes online or find them in stores. But who's going to pay for all those scanners, which cost about $35,000 each, and the staff to run them?","The Dallas model, prominent in the South and Southwest, sees a growing population as a sign of urban health. Cities liberally permit housing construction to accommodate new residents. The Los Angeles model, common on the West Coast and in the Northeast Corridor, discourages growth by limiting new housing.","The mobile middle class gravitates to the cities where housing is affordable.","Some of the higher price of L.A. real estate does reflect the intrinsic pleasure of living there, as I'm reminded every time I walk out my door into the perfect weather.","Even before Sputnik, scientists and policy makers worried that not enough Americans were studying science.","'Frankenstein' did not invent the fear of science; the novel found its audience because it dramatized anxieties that already existed. Although popular entertainment can, over the long run, shape public perceptions, it becomes popular in the first place only if it addresses preexisting hopes, fears, and fascinations.","'CSI' has not only remained a top-rated show through seven seasons; it has had real-world consequences. Police and prosecutors complain of a 'CSI' effect' that leads juries to demand more physical evidence than they used to expect. College officials use the same term to describe spiking enrollment in forensic-science programs.","Behind the criticism of fashion as an artistic medium is a highly ideological prejudice: against markets, against consumers, against the dynamism of Western commercial society. The debate is not about art but about culture and economics.","With its fluctuating forms and needless decoration, fashion epitomizes the supposedly unproductive waste that inspired 20th-century technocrats to dream of central planning. It exists for no good reason. But that's practically a definition of art.","Clothes are unique sculptures, dependent on a supporting human form and created to move.","Lofts were never supposed to be homes. They were vacant old factories and warehouses, taken over by artists looking for cheap space and good light.","Loft living is the antithesis of suburban domesticity, if only because the open spaces don't easily accommodate family life. Lofts also offer residents the opportunity - and responsibility - to structure their own space to reflect what's important to them.","What makes a loft authentic isn't its layout or its history but its ability to give people a true home - a dwelling that reflects their personalities and aspirations, including their dreams of urbanity.","Our eyes and brains pretty consistently like some human forms better than others. Shown photos of strangers, even babies look longer at the faces adults rank the best-looking.","The glamour of air travel - its aspirational meaning in the public imagination - disappeared before its luxury did, dissipating as flying gradually became commonplace.","Before it became a ubiquitous part of urban life, Starbucks was, in most American cities, a radically new idea.","Cinema isn't just a good medium for translating graphic novels. It's specifically a good medium for superheroes. On a fundamental, emotional level, superheroes, whether in print or on film, serve the same function for their audience as Golden Age movie stars did for theirs: they create glamour.","The whole point of movie glamour was - and is - escape.","The low point for neon came in 1982, when Holiday Inn did away with its signature 'Great Sign,' replacing the neon extravaganza with a forgettable green plastic box.","Storage problems make neon signs the most ephemeral of commercial arts.","Although people often equate them, glamour is not the same as beauty, stylishness, luxury, celebrity, or sex appeal. It is not limited to fashion or film; nor is it intrinsically feminine. It is not a collection of aesthetic markers - a style, as fashion and design use the word.","In the fall of 1978, I left the religious, conservative, biracial, slow-paced culture of South Carolina for the secular, liberal, multi-ethnic, intense culture of Princeton University. Like most immigrants, I was looking for a better life in a place I only half understood.","We are material creatures who spend much of our lives on material pursuits (even building a cathedral or writing a novel requires stone and mortar or paper and ink).","Average Americans order nonfat decaf iced vanilla lattes at Starbucks and choose from 1,500 drawer pulls at The Great Indoors. Amazon gives every town a bookstore with 2 million titles, while Netflix promises 35,000 different movies on DVD. Choice is everywhere - liberating to some, but to others, a new source of stress.","Habituation is indeed a fact of human psychology. That's one reason we like novelty, including different cuts of jeans.","From the days of biplanes and silk scarves, the aviator has been the archetype of masculine glamour. Aviators have personified national ideals, from French elan to Soviet party discipline. They've inspired lust and admiration. They've turned sunglasses and short, utilitarian leather jackets into fashion statements.","The Taliban outlawed wearing polish in the late 1990s, punishing some offenders by amputating a fingertip. Importing polish was banned only in July 2001, which suggests that women were still wearing painted nails within the safety of their homes.","The impulse for personal adornment is hard to stamp out.","Like the 'test tube babies' born of in vitro fertilization, cloned children need not be identifiable, much less freaks or outcasts.","The mere existence of 'Buffy' proves the declinists wrong about one thing: Hollywood commercialism can produce great art. Complex and evolving characters. Playful language. Joy and sorrow, pathos and elation. Episodes that dare to be different - to tell stories in silence or in song. Big themes and terrible choices.","More than two decades after the birth of Louise Brown, and all the hysteria that surrounded her 'test tube' conception, we should know that institutions, not technologies, create dystopias. Artificially conceived children are everywhere, beloved by their parents, and they haven't radically altered our world.","The theater itself is a lie. Its deaths are mere special effects. Its tales never happened. Even the histories are distorted for dramatic effect. The theater is unnatural, a place of imagination. But the theater tells the audience something true: that the world requires judgments.","The Internet exposes a diversity of opinion, experience, and taste we'd been led to believe didn't exist. If you were unusual in 1950 or 1980 - and everyone is unusual in one way or another - you were an isolated anomaly. Now you're a Web ring, a Yahoo category.","I like kids, but I don't expect to have any of my own. I'm 40 years old and spend most of my time working. I'd be a terrible mother.","People without children do have the freedom to do things that caring parents with dependent kids can't - to work long hours, to travel frequently, to relocate, and to do all these things on short notice if necessary. In return, they can achieve positions that devoted parents can't.","Americans hate their cable companies - for bumbling installers, on-again-off-again transmissions, peculiar channel selections, and indifferent customer service. The only thing cable subscribers hate more than the cable company is not being able to get what it delivers: multichannel selection and good reception.","Viewers don't care how big media companies are. They care whether they can dump those they don't like, whether because of lousy service or because of crummy shows.","A standard 'well woman' checkup can last as little as 10 minutes, hardly time for any in-depth discussions.","Many different relationships among patients, doctors, and drugs are possible and desirable. As in so many other areas of life, the Internet encourages experimentation. Questionnaire-based pharmacies operate between the traditional prescription and over-the-counter models.","Rising living standards - whether in a village, a region, a nation, or the world - depend first on specialization: on letting people concentrate on what they do best and trade with others who specialize in other things.","The Internet's abundance - of information, goods, tastes and sources of authority - creates unparalleled opportunities for individuals to get exactly what they want. But this plenitude threatens political and cultural authorities who believe in telling individuals what they can have rather than letting them choose for themselves.","The Internet ethos of diversity and competition runs exactly counter to uniform, gatekeeper-oriented medical culture - the technocratic philosophy of the 'one best way' embodied in our pharmaceutical regulations. On the Net, medical information is abundant, and pharmacies, domestic and foreign, operate on many different models.","Internet pharmacies return to consumers the choice promised by supporters of the 1938 Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. That law established federal requirements for drug safety and labeling but exempted prescription medicines from the labeling rules.","Surprise drives progress because innovation depends on the sort of knowledge no one can gather in a central place.","Just as producers often give consumers things they want but didn't think to ask for, consumers sometimes come up with surprising uses for new inventions. When a new product appears, it can uncover dissatisfactions and desires no one knew were there.","When I was in college, I wanted to be editor of 'Reason' when I grew up. It was an impractical ambition, especially since the magazine was located in Santa Barbara, way off any journalist's normal career path.","Through the 1990s, 'Reason' was a voice of 'dissident feminism,' upholding the equal dignity of both sexes and supporting the rights of individuals against a government that had gone mad over sexual harassment.","Grassroots techies - the mostly unknown people who write code and start companies that don't make the headlines - hate, loathe, and despise Microsoft. At technology conferences, it is the devil, or the guaranteed laugh line. Its products are mocked, its business practices booed.","Bill Clinton has done some incredibly reckless, irresponsible things as president. But his campaign to expand Medicare entitlements has to rank among the worst.","Medicare is immune from the competitive pressures that force private insurers to pay attention to what patients and doctors want.","In 'The Future and Its Enemies,' I argue that individual creativity and enterprise are not only personally satisfying but socially good, producing progress and happiness. For celebrating creativity and happiness, I have been called a fascist by critics on both coasts.","Apocalyptic fiction, while ultimately about God's purposes, usually portrays an immediate, human world of competing conspiracies. Whatever happens is orchestrated, coordinated and planned in advance.","The Y2K bug is a genuine technical concern, consuming the energies of many specialists. But the prophecies of doom represent a broader worldview using the bug as a news hook. In this vision, the good society is a stable society, undisrupted by innovation, ambition or outside influences.","Wars without military objectives have a tendency to go on forever.","The history of the Internet is not, as some people have tried to make it, a libertarian just-so story. It is a messy tale in which the government played a significant role. That role was, however, far more subtle than the plans of industrial policy gurus or techno-boosting politicians.","Y2K hype taps our native discomfort with the realities of a dynamic, evolving social order. It elevates personal, local contact over the impersonality of the 'extended order' of trade and technological networks. It suggests that we can wipe the slate clean and start from scratch.","On the Internet, people on the tails of the bell curve can find one another.","By giving unusual people an easy way to find one another, the Internet has also enabled them to pool rare talents, resources, and voices, then push their case into public consciousness. The response, in many cases, is a kind of hysteria.","On the Net, the bell curve reclaims its tails. The uncommon is as accessible as the common. The very fragmentation of the Internet allows us to find ourselves in other people - and to know that we are not alone."],"Virginia Satir":["Problems are not the problem; coping is the problem.","Feelings of worth can flourish only in an atmosphere where individual differences are appreciated, mistakes are tolerated, communication is open, and rules are flexible - the kind of atmosphere that is found in a nurturing family.","Every word, facial expression, gesture, or action on the part of a parent gives the child some message about self-worth. It is sad that so many parents don't realize what messages they are sending.","We must not allow other people's limited perceptions to define us.","Adolescents are not monsters. They are just people trying to learn how to make it among the adults in the world, who are probably not so sure themselves.","What lingers from the parent's individual past, unresolved or incomplete, often becomes part of her or his irrational parenting.","Life is not what it's supposed to be. It's what it is. The way you cope with it is what makes the difference.","We need 4 hugs a day for survival. We need 8 hugs a day for maintenance. We need 12 hugs a day for growth.","We can learn something new anytime we believe we can.","So much is asked of parents, and so little is given."],"Virginia Williams":["We have a responsibility to help those around us and help others in need.","It was very clear to me early on that balancing work and family was going to be very important.","I love my work, and I always get a jolt of adrenaline anytime I'm on set.","I just love that Free the Slaves does such a great job of gathering communities, gathering people together, and giving them the information, arming them, educating them. That's how we're going to change the world.","I felt like a failure, like somehow my self-worth was tied to my ability to procreate. I didn't feel like I could talk about it. I did not want other people's pity, so I mostly kept my story and my feelings to myself.","When a woman opens up about her fertility struggles, I feel less alone, and I hope to help others in the same way.","Ford is such an answered prayer and an absolute blessing.","I think a lot of moms get really scared that if they have a nanny that somehow the child is going to love them less and attach more to the nanny. But, I haven't had that fear.","I loved my nanny very much, but she was never a replacement for my mom in any way.","I free slaves because I believe we are all created equal. I just can't think of anything that has a higher purpose than putting value on human life.","People love telling their stories, even if they're very, very sad ones. People love to communicate and express."],"Virginia Woolf":["Some people go to priests; others to poetry; I to my friends.","One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well.","Language is wine upon the lips.","You cannot find peace by avoiding life.","It is fatal to be a man or woman pure and simple: one must be a woman manly, or a man womanly.","Rigid, the skeleton of habit alone upholds the human frame.","The eyes of others our prisons; their thoughts our cages.","Life is not a series of gig lamps symmetrically arranged; life is a luminous halo, a semi-transparent envelope surrounding us from the beginning of consciousness to the end.","For most of history, Anonymous was a woman.","As a woman I have no country. As a woman my country is the whole world.","Arrange whatever pieces come your way.","The telephone, which interrupts the most serious conversations and cuts short the most weighty observations, has a romance of its own.","On the outskirts of every agony sits some observant fellow who points.","It is far harder to kill a phantom than a reality.","Where the Mind is biggest, the Heart, the Senses, Magnanimity, Charity, Tolerance, Kindliness, and the rest of them scarcely have room to breathe.","Once conform, once do what other people do because they do it, and a lethargy steals over all the finer nerves and faculties of the soul. She becomes all outer show and inward emptiness; dull, callous, and indifferent.","A good essay must have this permanent quality about it; it must draw its curtain round us, but it must be a curtain that shuts us in not out.","Someone has to die in order that the rest of us should value life more.","The beauty of the world, which is so soon to perish, has two edges, one of laughter, one of anguish, cutting the heart asunder.","Yet, it is true, poetry is delicious; the best prose is that which is most full of poetry.","Humor is the first of the gifts to perish in a foreign tongue.","Every secret of a writer's soul, every experience of his life, every quality of his mind is written large in his works.","Why are women... so much more interesting to men than men are to women?","The poet gives us his essence, but prose takes the mold of the body and mind.","The older one grows, the more one likes indecency.","These are the soul's changes. I don't believe in ageing. I believe in forever altering one's aspect to the sun. Hence my optimism.","Almost any biographer, if he respects facts, can give us much more than another fact to add to our collection. He can give us the creative fact; the fertile fact; the fact that suggests and engenders.","My own brain is to me the most unaccountable of machinery - always buzzing, humming, soaring roaring diving, and then buried in mud. And why? What's this passion for?","The man who is aware of himself is henceforward independent; and he is never bored, and life is only too short, and he is steeped through and through with a profound yet temperate happiness.","I thought how unpleasant it is to be locked out; and I thought how it is worse, perhaps, to be locked in.","Fiction is like a spider's web, attached ever so slightly perhaps, but still attached to life at all four corners. Often the attachment is scarcely perceptible.","If you do not tell the truth about yourself you cannot tell it about other people.","I can only note that the past is beautiful because one never realises an emotion at the time. It expands later, and thus we don't have complete emotions about the present, only about the past.","This soul, or life within us, by no means agrees with the life outside us. If one has the courage to ask her what she thinks, she is always saying the very opposite to what other people say.","Mental fight means thinking against the current, not with it. It is our business to puncture gas bags and discover the seeds of truth.","It seems as if an age of genius must be succeeded by an age of endeavour; riot and extravagance by cleanliness and hard work.","Boredom is the legitimate kingdom of the philanthropic.","Masterpieces are not single and solitary births; they are the outcome of many years of thinking in common, of thinking by the body of the people, so that the experience of the mass is behind the single voice.","One of the signs of passing youth is the birth of a sense of fellowship with other human beings as we take our place among them.","Who shall measure the hat and violence of the poet's heart when caught and tangled in a woman's body?","Sleep, that deplorable curtailment of the joy of life.","Women have served all these centuries as looking glasses possessing the power of reflecting the figure of man at twice its natural size.","To enjoy freedom we have to control ourselves.","Great bodies of people are never responsible for what they do.","Really I don't like human nature unless all candied over with art.","Nothing has really happened until it has been recorded.","The beautiful seems right by force of beauty, and the feeble wrong because of weakness.","One likes people much better when they're battered down by a prodigious siege of misfortune than when they triumph.","If we help an educated man's daughter to go to Cambridge are we not forcing her to think not about education but about war? - not how she can learn, but how she can fight in order that she might win the same advantages as her brothers?","It is the nature of the artist to mind excessively what is said about him. Literature is strewn with the wreckage of men who have minded beyond reason the opinions of others.","Each has his past shut in him like the leaves of a book known to him by his heart, and his friends can only read the title.","For what Harley Street specialist has time to understand the body, let alone the mind or both in combination, when he is a slave to thirteen thousand a year?","We can best help you to prevent war not by repeating your words and following your methods but by finding new words and creating new methods.","It is far more difficult to murder a phantom than a reality.","The history of men's opposition to women's emancipation is more interesting perhaps than the story of that emancipation itself.","The truth is, I often like women. I like their unconventionality. I like their completeness. I like their anonymity.","One has to secrete a jelly in which to slip quotations down people's throats - and one always secretes too much jelly.","Literature is strewn with the wreckage of men who have minded beyond reason the opinions of others.","To depend upon a profession is a less odious form of slavery than to depend upon a father.","A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction.","It is in our idleness, in our dreams, that the submerged truth sometimes comes to the top.","That great Cathedral space which was childhood.","This is not writing at all. Indeed, I could say that Shakespeare surpasses literature altogether, if I knew what I meant.","I would venture to guess that Anon, who wrote so many poems without signing them, was often a woman.","Yet it is in our idleness, in our dreams, that the submerged truth sometimes comes to the top.","The connection between dress and war is not far to seek; your finest clothes are those you wear as soldiers.","I was in a queer mood, thinking myself very old: but now I am a woman again - as I always am when I write.","There can be no two opinions as to what a highbrow is. He is the man or woman of thoroughbred intelligence who rides his mind at a gallop across country in pursuit of an idea.","I want the concentration and the romance, and the worlds all glued together, fused, glowing: have no time to waste any more on prose.","If one could be friendly with women, what a pleasure - the relationship so secret and private compared with relations with men. Why not write about it truthfully?","Indeed, I would venture to guess that Anon, who wrote so many poems without signing them, was often a woman.","It's not catastrophes, murders, deaths, diseases, that age and kill us; it's the way people look and laugh, and run up the steps of omnibuses.","Odd how the creative power at once brings the whole universe to order.","Let a man get up and say, Behold, this is the truth, and instantly I perceive a sandy cat filching a piece of fish in the background. Look, you have forgotten the cat, I say.","Thought and theory must precede all salutary action; yet action is nobler in itself than either thought or theory.","I read the book of Job last night, I don't think God comes out well in it.","Nothing induces me to read a novel except when I have to make money by writing about it. I detest them.","You send a boy to school in order to make friends - the right sort.","When the shriveled skin of the ordinary is stuffed out with meaning, it satisfies the senses amazingly.","Somewhere, everywhere, now hidden, now apparent in what ever is written down, is the form of a human being. If we seek to know him, are we idly occupied?","There is much to support the view that it is clothes that wear us, and not we, them; we may make them take the mould of arm or breast, but they mould our hearts, our brains, our tongues to their liking.","A masterpiece is something said once and for all, stated, finished, so that it's there complete in the mind, if only at the back.","It is curious how instinctively one protects the image of oneself from idolatry or any other handling that could make it ridiculous, or too unlike the original to be believed any longer.","We are nauseated by the sight of trivial personalities decomposing in the eternity of print.","This is an important book, the critic assumes, because it deals with war. This is an insignificant book because it deals with the feelings of women in a drawing-room.","If you insist upon fighting to protect me, or 'our' country, let it be understood soberly and rationally between us that you are fighting to gratify a sex instinct which I cannot share; to procure benefits where I have not shared and probably will not share."],"Virginie LeDoyen":["You're always compared to someone, especially when you're a French actress.","DiCaprio's life is the perfect example of how not to be. I would not wish his life on anybody.","And I would never accept a film because of the money. I have enough money.","Well, it gives me the opportunity to make the movies that I want to do, because L'Oreal pays me very well. Also it means that I can work with great directors. My last commercial was directed by Erick Zonca, who made 'Dream Life of Angels.' And finally, it doesn't take up a lot of my time.","I'm pretty normal looking.","Usually most characters I play are quite realistic."],"Vissarion Belinsky":["I am strongly convinced that the people or society is the best and the most unerring critic.","Do not worry about the incarnation of ideas. If you are a poet, your works will contain them without your knowledge'they will be both moral and national if you follow your inspiration freely."],"Viswanathan Anand":["I think an important lesson from the game is that once you have made a move, you cannot take it back. You really have to measure your decisions. You think a lot. You evaluate your choices very carefully. There's never any guarantee about what's going to follow once you have made a decision.","I attend to my fitness. I go the gym every day and try to maintain my physical fitness; without that, it is tough to take challenges on the chess board.","It's important, according to me, to train in small doses so as to not lose the joy of playing chess. I personally think too many coaching and training classes may take away a child's interest in the game itself. The essential thing to do is practise often and, in case of a doubt, to consult a trainer.","If revenge motivates you, go for it! But the main thing is to set your game in order.","The broader the chess player you are, the easier it is to be competitive, and the same seems to be true of mathematics - if you can find links between different branches of mathematics, it can help you resolve problems. In both mathematics and chess, you study existing theory and use that to go forward.","There are some aspects of work you need to keep working on and no matter what environment you are in. Continuous learning is very important. It's what I call 'competitive tension', which is about having a competition around.","In chess, knowledge is a very transient thing. It changes so fast that even a single mouse-slip sometimes changes the evaluation.","Things like the financial markets - a proper grounding in mathematics could help the common man. I believe that if people are more familiar with mathematical concepts... it can help deal with modern life, which is increasingly complex.","My parents were very supportive of my chess. When I got home after a game of chess, having missed school or something, they always made me feel very welcome; I didn't feel guilty at all about pursuing chess with such fervour. They never, for instance, perceived sports as a rival to academics.","I keep forcing, I keep learning new things in the game, and so far I have been taking challenges as they come.","I don't bench press, but I use machines to work 10-12 muscle groups. Biceps, triceps, a few things for the back, calves, shoulders and so on - and then I'll go on the running machine, cross-trainer or mountain climber.","A win is a win, which is about that particular moment.","Before a game, I avoid having a heavy meal so that I don't feel sleepy at the board. You eat to be healthy, and that generally takes care of everything. Also, you can't be too finicky, since at tournaments you tend to eat at restaurants here and there. But, as long as you're eating sensibly, it's all good.","Sometimes, if you are nervous, it could actually turn out to be a manifestation of your exhaustion. The point is that any setback is bad, but if you see it from a perspective, you'll recover.","I have a love for astronomy; Aruna, my wife, and I love travelling, so whenever we get an opportunity, we set off to explore places that have tickled our interest. We are also wildlife enthusiasts.","I feel that schools and corporates should help the government in popularising sports in the country. Blaming the government for every sporting debacle will not be fair.","Of course, you feel good to play in a familiar environment. I enjoyed Delhi 2000 a lot. But the advantage doesn't work during a game. There, only the moves count.","Parents, first and foremost, it is important to... understand and recognise the activities your child is naturally gravitating towards. It's important also to ensure that your child likes what he or she is doing. I believe in exposing children to as many hobbies and extracurricular activities as possible.","Sometimes an opponent stops breathing, and you realise something drastic has happened and they are trying not to let on. Or they go quiet, or they get fidgety. After a while you pick these things up and become more alert to them.","Grandmasters decline with age. That's a given. There is nothing special about the age of 40, but age eventually takes its toll. That much is clear. Beyond that, it's about how long you can put off the effects and compensate for them. Mistakes will crop in, but you try to compensate for them with experience and hard work.","In Gujarat, we had the world record of largest number of chess games in a single venue - 20,500 - and in Tamil Nadu, I have been emphasizing on the positives of chess to the authorities.","I like to keep myself physically and mentally fit before any important match. I usually take a short nap just before the game and do not practice immediately before the tournament.","My practice schedule is not constant and changes a lot and depends on my moods also.","When you play with the best in the world, it is important that you not lose focus. You must be fully focused. Even a minor error could result in a massive defeat.","I appreciate the support and anyone who takes up a position on my behalf. Especially in matches, this feeling that there are people behind you, gives me a lot of strength.","For me, each game is a new challenge, which has to be dealt with rationally and systematically. At that time, every other thought fades into oblivion.","I go to the gym every day. That tends to taper off when I'm at a tournament. During tournaments, I'm not trying to build fitness. I'm simply trying to keep away any kind of tension. I go for long walks to clear my head.","I was very lucky that while I was a chess player in a country where chess was not a big deal, I happened to be in the one city where there was a sprouting chess team: Chennai.","In any match, there are few critical moments where there's no second best decision. The rest of the moves are intuitive.","In the knockout tournaments, it's futile to prepare for a grand finale. You may have worked out many strategies for the final. But you may lose in the first round itself.","Each match I play is the most important one yet.","Professional players work almost every day, for hours on end, and the emphasis is on the word 'work.' It can be with a partner or it can be alone, but professional chess is always a pursuit of something new and surprising.","Preparedness for a game that usually lasts four-five hours requires good physical condition and also steady nerves.","I don't know how many calories an average chess player burns per game, but it often exceeds that of a player in ball games. It is not only the chess as such: You need to be fit and undergo complicated preparation.","I personally prefer long-distance walking, but we are talking about pre-tournament preparation. During a tournament I make do with walking, mainly to concentrate before a game.","India has lot of talent. What I am happy with is that the talent keeps on coming. Certainly it could be nice, though I am not terribly keen on seeing my successor yet.","My job is to play chess, the game that I love. I achieve what I can in chess. That is what I focus on. Basically, I am always focused on playing the game, and this is important to me.","There are two aspects to being competitive; one is to do with sports, and the other is about technical skills. Being able to recollect the moves and apply them when necessary is a critical aspect.","If you have a strong opponent, a competition is stimulating. I am generally most open to ideas when I have had a bad result. In chess, too, players specialise. This specialty then becomes an entry barrier.","When I was about six, I saw my elder siblings play chess and pestered my mother into teaching me. Very soon, I was beating everyone at home, and they thought it would be good to join a club. So my sister would take me to the Tal chess club on Thursdays and weekends.","I love travelling and going on wildlife safaris. I have an interest in astronomy. I like reading on current affairs, business and science. I love doing nothing if I can help it.","Chess has given me a lot more than I could ask for. I have been able to feel special, travel the world and do what I truly enjoy. Moreover, chess players love being their own boss and hate having to wake up early!","Chess as a sport requires a lot of mental stamina, and this is what that makes it different from a physical sport. Chess players have a unique ability of taking in a lot of information and remembering relevant bits. So, memory and mental stamina are the key attributes.","There is always the risk of being over-confident when you are preparing to face a weaker player.","You bring to chess facets of your personality and what you are. I have interests other than chess, like music and world and current affairs. I also have many friends around the world with whom I like to keep in touch.","Each match I approach like a new one. The work is so immense that you don't have time to sit and ponder.","Before a match, I do not follow any chess news except the games.","When there's an important tournament going on, I try and stay in a bubble. It's easy that way because then you don't have to worry about anything else.","I honestly don't remember when and why I started calling my mom 'Momsi'. These are family things; it starts for some reason. It's not that I just call her Momsi; I call her other things as well!","There is technology where you can watch the match live online and also on TV. If people understood the game, I'm sure we would have a lot of chess fans by now.","We want more women players to take up chess. There are few participants at the national level and hope it will grow.","I was reasonably interested in mathematics in school. Typically what happens is... when you start playing chess, it takes up a lot of your attention. But about 10 years ago, I found that the Internet is very good to start learning about a lot of subjects.","The Internet gives you access to a lot of material, and it's fun to sit and read. I go to something like Wikipedia and look at different topics... I find the subject fascinating. I like to read about concepts and mathematicians."],"Vita Sackville-West":["There are no signposts in the sea.","What is beautiful is good, and who is good will soon be beautiful.","Authority has every reason to fear the skeptic, for authority can rarely survive in the face of doubt.","Men of my age live in a state of continual desperation.","I worshipped dead men for their strength, forgetting I was strong.","The writer catches the changes of his mind on the hop. Growth is exciting; growth is dynamic and alarming. Growth of the soul, growth of the mind.","Travel is the most private of pleasures. There is no greater bore than the travel bore. We do not in the least want to hear what he has seen in Hong Kong.","Nothing shows up the difference between the things said or read, so much as the daily experience of it.","Among the many problems which beset the novelist, not the least weighty is the choice of the moment at which to begin his novel.","Women, like men, ought to have their youth so glutted with freedom they hate the very idea of freedom."],"Vitalik Buterin":["The industrial revolution allowed us, for the first time, to start replacing human labour with machines.","Whereas most technologies tend to automate workers on the periphery doing menial tasks, blockchains automate away the center. Instead of putting the taxi driver out of a job, blockchain puts Uber out of a job and lets the taxi drivers work with the customer directly.","Scalability is this idea of coming up with a blockchain that can scale much larger than existing chains essentially by processing transactions in parallel. And moving away from this paradigm where every single node on the network has to process every single transaction.","When I came up with Ethereum, my first first thought was, 'Okay, this thing is too good to be true.' As it turned out, the core Ethereum idea was good - fundamentally, completely sound.","The thing that I often ask startups on top of Ethereum is, 'Can you please tell me why using the Ethereum blockchain is better than using Excel?' And if they can come up with a good answer, that's when you know you've got something really interesting.","As society becomes more and more complex, cheating will in many ways become progressively easier and easier to do and harder to police or even understand.","In general, signalling theory says that if you have a good way of proving something and a noisy way of proving something, and you choose the noisy way, that means chances are it's because you couldn't do the good way in the first place.","Blockchain software companies may end up being amalgamated into existing software giants, at which point blockchain patents will just become part of the existing patent war.","The main advantage of blockchain technology is supposed to be that it's more secure, but new technologies are generally hard for people to trust, and this paradox can't really be avoided.","A smart contract is a mechanism involving digital assets and two or more parties, where some or all of the parties put assets in, and assets are automatically redistributed among those parties according to a formula based on certain data that is not known at the time the contract is initiated.","Giving users easy access to many different kinds of digital assets on the blockchain and, particularly, tokens that are linked to assets in the real world, is crucial to seeing blockchain adoption reach the next level, and I applaud Digix Global's initiative in being the first of many such projects to successfully launch.","In order to have a decentralised database, you need to have security. In order to have security, you need to - you need to have incentives.","The technical side of Ethereum's efficacy is 100% an engineering exercise.","I generally support just about every secession attempt that comes along. If, in the future, there is that kind of a dispute in Ethereum, I'd definitely be quite happy to see Ethereum A go in one direction and Ethereum B go the other.","I personally like hard forks. Particularly, I like the fact that they give users a measure of control, requiring them to opt in to protocol changes. Sure, they can be a little more chaotic if they're controversial, but that's the price of freedom.","I think Bitcoin really feels empowering in a sense.","When I was in grade five or six, I just remember quite a lot of people were always talking about me like I was some kind of math genius. And there were just so many moments when I realized, like, okay, why can't I just be like some normal person and go have a 75% average like everyone else.","I think people don't realise that running a piece of code that verifies some conditions for a financial transaction, that by itself is a lot less work than verifying a cryptographic signature, and so even if the virtual machine is inefficient, the cryptographic signature is still going to dominate.","Bitcoin is great as a form of digital money, but its scripting language is too weak for any kind of serious advanced applications to be built on top.","Although the Ethereum blockchain is a public blockchain, it is great to see private and consortium blockchains using the Ethereum code base actively under development.","The Ethereum client is literally a fork of Chromium's webkit backend. The idea is that users can build their own interfaces with HTML/JavaScript just like websites, and they will be viewable with the browser much like websites are viewable with the web browser.","Initially, I thought that Ethereum was a thing that would be used for people to write simple financial scripts. As it turns out, people are writing stuff like Augur on top of it.","You can write anything that you would be able to write on a server and put it onto the blockchain. Instead of Javascript making calls to the server, you would be making calls to the blockchain.","I remember knowing, for a while, for a long time, that I was kind of abnormal in some sense.","I personally, generally, don't really feel much emotion if there's some problem and I'm actively solving it.","Blockchains will drop search costs, causing a kind of decomposition that allows you to have markets of entities that are horizontally segregated and vertically segregated.","Some bitcoin users see the hard fork as in some ways violating their most fundamental values. I personally think these fundamental values, pushed to such extremes, are silly.","Many people at different levels of the Russian government are open to crypto-currencies.","You could imagine something like a completely automated system for renting bikes that's just done completely over blockchain crypto-payments. And theoretically just sort of start it up, and it works completely autonomously.","There is definitely a lot of banks that are interested in private blockchains. In some cases, they are happy with public blockchains as well. The opposition to just doing things on a public blockchain is definitely smaller than some of the strongest detractors think."],"Vito Fossella":["Hamas is responsible for countless homicide bombings that have killed hundreds of Israeli citizens. They have waged a terror war with the sole intent of murdering innocent people.","First at the outset, let me commend the great men and women of the United States Coast Guard for what they do.","One of the essential elements of government responsibility is to communicate effectively to the American people, especially in time of a potential terrorist attack or a natural disaster.","Those whose lives were lost on September 11 will remain in our thoughts and prayers forever.","I won't tolerate lying.","We know that the most fundamental responsibility of our Federal Government is to ensure the safety of its people and to protect and ensure our National security. And clearly port security has been left in limbo.","The Staten Island Ferry remains a potential terrorist target.","Vetting and verifying information is one thing. Having our government sending out conflicting messages to the American people when conflict can be avoided is another.","And finally, let me just say it is a fact that not every city can dedicate resources to terrorism.","The sad fact is that the same terrorist scenarios, if they occurred in five different States, there could be five different sets of responses to the American people. We need, at a minimum, a level of coordination on communicating threats to the public.","In New York alone, there was an average of more than 300 campus fires per year between 1997 and 2000, with roughly 160 of them annually in dormitories.","As many know, and especially those who may have young sons or daughters at colleges or universities, the last thing you want to hear is a call that perhaps one of your children was injured or, even worse, lost their life in a tragic fire at a dorm or campus housing.","Lebanon can choose to be either a partner in ridding the scourge of terrorism or another obstacle that cows to the most radical elements of society.","Ukraine has been a strong partner to the United States on international initiatives and a committed ally in fighting the War on Terrorism.","Ukraine is also successfully moving toward democracy and making progress expanding freedoms and rights to its people. We can help Ukraine achieve these goals and improve its economy by normalizing trade relations.","Mr. Speaker, on September 11, 2001, the United States was attacked, and Britain stood with us. This was not only an attack against America, but against the civilized world; and Britain understood this.","From the Bush Administration to the 9-11 Commission, there is an urgent and universally recognized need to change the broken formula through which Homeland Security grant money currently is allocated to our first responders.","In the annals of history, few men have left a more positive imprint on the world than Pope John Paul II.","Every single day, we have hundreds, if not thousands of police officers protecting the lives of not just New Yorkers, but the millions who come to New York City to work and to vacation.","Russia under President Putin is less democratic and less free today than when he assumed office. If Russia cannot fulfill its obligation to the G-8 and maintain a high standard of democratic governance then its membership should be suspended.","The issue for me is American competitiveness, and how do we best create a climate here that allows international capital to come to these shores to create jobs.","If you're a retail investor, you have set aside some of your hard-earned money for investment or to create a nest egg, for your kids or family.","I represent Staten Island and Brooklyn, and not just that the financial services industry is important to the U.S., but is disproportionately important to New York City.","I think the Bush tax cuts should be made permanent."],"Vitruvius":["Consistency is found in that work whose whole and detail are suitable to the occasion. It arises from circumstance, custom, and nature.","Nothing requires the architect's care more than the due proportions of buildings.","Music assists him in the use of harmonic and mathematical proportion.","Architecture is a science arising out of many other sciences, and adorned with much and varied learning; by the help of which a judgment is formed of those works which are the result of other arts.","Beauty is produced by the pleasing appearance and good taste of the whole, and by the dimensions of all the parts being duly proportioned to each other.","Proportion is that agreeable harmony between the several parts of a building, which is the result of a just and regular agreement of them with each other; the height to the width, this to the length, and each of these to the whole.","Wind is a floating wave of air, whose undulation continually varies.","In setting out the walls of a city the choice of a healthy situation is of the first importance: it should be on high ground, neither subject to fogs nor rains; its aspects should be neither violently hot nor intensely cold, but temperate in both respects.","Care should be taken that all buildings are well lighted: in those of the country this point is easily accomplished, because the wall of a neighbour is not likely to interfere with the light.","Marble is not alike in all countries.","For an object under the eye will appear very different from the same object placed above it; in an inclosed space, very different from the same in an open space.","But I, Caesar, have not sought to amass wealth by the practice of my art, having been rather contented with a small fortune and reputation, than desirous of abundance accompanied by a want of reputation.","I am moreover inclined to be concise when I reflect on the constant occupation of the citizens in public and private affairs, so that in their few leisure moments they may read and understand as much as possible.","Wherefore the mere practical architect is not able to assign sufficient reasons for the forms he adopts; and the theoretic architect also fails, grasping the shadow instead of the substance.","Perhaps, to the uninformed, it may appear unaccountable that a man should be able to retain in his memory such a variety of learning; but the close alliance with each other, of the different branches of science, will explain the difficulty.","Dimension regulated the general scale of the work, so that the parts may all tell and be effective.","Economy consists in a due and proper application of the means afforded according to the ability of the employer and the situation chosen; care being taken that the expenditure is prudently conducted.","Bodies which contain a greater proportion of water than is necessary to balance the other elements, are speedily corrupted, and lose their virtues and properties.","From the exterior face of the wall towers must be projected, from which an approaching enemy may be annoyed by weapons, from the embrasures of those towers, right and left.","An easy approach to the walls must be provided against: indeed they should be surrounded by uneven ground, and the roads leading to the gates should be winding and turn to the left from the gates.","The thickness of the walls should be sufficient for two armed men to pass each other with ease.","The lanes and streets of the city being set out, the choice of sites for the convenience and use of the state remains to be decided on; for sacred edifices, for the forum, and for other public buildings.","The temple of Ceres should be in a solitary spot out of the city, to which the public are not necessarily led but for the purpose of sacrificing to her.","I, therefore, O Caesar, do not publish this work, merely prefixing my name to a treatise which of right belongs to others, nor think of acquiring reputation by finding fault with the works of any one.","Quicksilver is used for many purposes; without it, neither silver nor brass can be properly gilt.","Since, therefore, individuals as well as the public are so indebted to these writers for the benefits they enjoy, I think them not only entitled to the honour of palms and crowns, but even to be numbered among the gods.","When it passes towards the east, the sun begins to have less effect upon it, and a thin line on the edge of its bright side emits its splendour towards the earth.","Harmony is an obscure and difficult musical science, but most difficult to those who are not acquainted with the Greek language; because it is necessary to use many Greek words to which there are none corresponding in Latin."],"Vittoria Ceretti":["When I'm not working, I go for runs. I live around many parks, so it's nice to feel like you're not surrounded by the city.","Be kind to everyone you meet - and most importantly, never compare your career to another model's.","I went to school like everyone else, but I hated it, and I always had a lot of problems. Even my younger brother Guglielmo is the same way: we can't stay cooped up in a room for hours, listening.","There are still many places around the globe I would like to explore, and I'm going to trust my modeling career to take me to at least some of them!","Street fashion forever.","In the morning, I always eat fruit and yogurt with cereal. And for lunch and dinner, I always have vegetables as a side.","I use a nude color on my nails all the time!","I love smoothies and Vitamin Water, but I always have some iced tea in my fridge!","I don't often wear mascara in real life, but on-set or backstage, if I'm crying or even if my eyes get watery, I get a Q-Tip, and I wet it with a few drops of water. Then I go lash by lash and clean it up.","I studied psychology in school, and I learned how to understand people's feelings, how to get along with people and relate to people.","I've always had it inside - this ability to read people, how to get into someone else's head and help them with their problems. And I love when people trust me with their feelings and I can get into any kind of dialogue with them about their inner stuff. I think it's the thing I enjoy most besides modeling.","Feelings come at really unexpected moments to all of us, and they come so fast.","I really love movies! I have seen so many, I can't say my favourite one.","I really love large and comfy dresses.","Fashion world is a unique one, and I love being part of it! I find it fascinating.","I love doing things quietly. I love being with friends. I love my parents and my brother Guglielmo. They are essentials to me.","If I'm going out and want to go crazy, I put on mascara - and that's it.","I don't really do healthy snacks!","I've always wanted to walk Prada, since I'm Italian. It was really a big thing for me.","I don't really do beauty.","I'm an outgoing girl who speaks well, is well-mannered and also fun.","I have an interesting life, and I'm strong.","I'm intrigued by smart people.","It's very important to understand how to act in any situation.","I didn't always want to be a model, but once I started, I realized how much I loved it."],"Vittorio Alfieri":["Deep vengeance is the daughter of deep silence.","Liars are always most disposed to swear.","A usurper always distrusts the whole world.","To err is human; but contrition felt for the crime distinguishes the virtuous from the wicked.","Heaven takes care that no man secures happiness by crime.","Often the test of courage is not to die but to live.","Disgrace does not consist in the punishment, but in the crime.","First thoughts are not always the best.","Ofttimes the test of courage becomes rather to live than to die.","Where there are laws, he who has not broken them need not tremble."],"Vittorio De Sica":["I've lost all my money on these films.

For me, the best teacher is life.","The main goal in my life is to make extraordinary things out of the ordinary.","When I sing, I always relive a part of my life.","People need heroes, in music and every aspect of life.","I think voice is like a good wine. If you work it well, it will mature.","I like the edge of danger."],"Viva Bianca":["When I was a little girl at school, I really wanted to be Katie or Sarah or Sophie. When you're a little girl at school, you want to be like the other little girls.","You don't even really get used to doing scenes where you have to kiss, or be particularly intimate, with another person who's not actually your lover in real life.","I don't really like the gym.","My father is a very theatrical and dramatic person.","Film is where I want to end up, but I don't want to let go of theatre."],"Vivek Ramaswamy":["The most important ingredient for the success of any company is the quality of its people, starting with its leadership team.","Our goal is to continue to build the pipeline to fight all aspects of disease for all forms of dementia.","The thing in Alzheimer's disease to remember, and we remember this all the time at Axovant, is we don't fully understand the way the actual underlying disease works.","In my opinion, in addition to the success we have achieved in launching new Vants and in pursuing development of a variety of drugs, one of our most important achievements has been the growth of Roivant itself as a platform to support the efficient identification and advancement of medicines across all of the companies in the Roivant family.","I think dementia is the major healthcare threat to our economy and our security. It's a ticking time bomb - we have a whole generation of baby boomers that are going to age, many progressing to get Alzheimer's - which disproportionately affects women and minorities.","It's a great disappointment as a leader in the biotech industry that with all the amazing things the drug industry has done in the last couple of decades, we have not made a single major advance, have not not developed a single new chemical entity approved for the treatment for Alzheimer's disease.","I take a lot of personal pride and motivation to be able to make a difference in areas that may fall through the cracks in R&D across the industry.","In contrast to how tech firms want to disrupt and break things - developing drugs must be incremental and step-by-step. This is the kind of work that involves people putting their lives on the line every day with clinical trials.","The more general skepticism about another millennial that likes to claim they're disrupting another industry - that doesn't serve me well.","I'd encourage more young people to apply their talents beyond finance and consulting and to think about reshaping how medicines are brought to market and how the business is run.","This may sound trite, but I believe it to be true: Entrepreneurship is the fabric of what America is all about.","I would think the correlation between an era of increased globalization and an increased desire to participate in an entrepreneurial endeavor is not a coincidence. When interconnectedness is at a peak due to technological advances, the ability to spawn something new is slightly easier.","From a personal standpoint, I consider myself much more of an accidental entrepreneur. I was involved in the entrepreneurship club at Harvard, but I heard of it only because it was new on campus.","There is probably a promising drug candidate that has already been discovered for the treatment of Down syndrome that is sitting on the shelf of some drug company.","For some companies, going public makes the most sense. For others, remaining private is preferable.","If we can validate our scientific bets in the clinic, if we can bring valuable new treatments to patients that need them, that will be our ultimate measure of success.","I really was inspired by the possibility of more directly being involved in the development of drugs myself.","I've said all along that we're building Axovant as a lasting company for the long run, not to hand over that upside to a pharma company in the future.","The problem we are trying to solve is that of drugs that would have never seen the light of day for reasons that have nothing to do with the inherent properties of drug candidates themselves and more to do with bureaucratic institutions within which they often sit.","I believe the pharma company of the future isn't going to be old-school.","I would not have had the same personal commitment to Alzheimer's disease if it had not been for my mother and my upbringing.","I can't comment on the internal decision-making at other companies, but RVT-101 has the potential to be a very valuable product in the treatment of Alzheimer's, which is a huge unmet medical need.","Our philosophy is to attract top talent and incentivise them to succeed. We have some of the top talent in the entire industry.","There is no doubt that the Mindset failure is a major setback for Axovant, but it is not the end of the road.","Roivant does not view - and has never viewed - Axovant as simply a 'vehicle' for developing intepirdine, but instead as a platform for the development of high-impact drugs in dementia and the neuroscience field more generally.","The 'Living-Wage Campaign' at Harvard is like a Boston winter: you know it's going to strike, but wonder only when and how hard."],"Vivek Wadhwa":["A key to achieving success is to assemble a strong and stable management team.","Corporate executives and business owners need to realize that there can be no compromise when it comes to ethics, and there are no easy shortcuts to success. Ethics need to be carefully sown into the fabric of their companies.","What you want in a mentor is someone who truly cares for you and who will look after your interests and not just their own. When you do come across the right person to mentor you, start by showing them that the time they spend with you is worthwhile.","A key ingredient in innovation is the ability to challenge authority and break rules.","Most successful entrepreneurs share their knowledge as a way of giving back. They do not demand compensation. Those who do are usually trying to take advantage of you.","An open-minded and diverse population that readily shares information, encourages experimentation, accepts failure and dispenses with formality and hierarchy is what makes Silicon Valley the successful hub that it is.","When I start getting embroiled in heated debates and feeling stressed, I just turn everything off and disconnect from the world. I simply tell my colleagues and friends that I am not well and need to cancel all meetings for a day or more. I take it easy - go for a long hike, take a vacation somewhere, or just stay at home and read.","Innovation is all about people. Innovation thrives when the population is diverse, accepting and willing to cooperate.","Building a company isn't that different from climbing a big mountain. You need people helping you traverse treacherous paths and to lift you up when you fall.","One of the biggest problems that software developers face is that technology changes rapidly. It is very hard to stay current.","The truth is that entrepreneurship is more like a roller coaster ride than a cruise.","Recruiting talent is no different than any other challenge a startup faces. It's all about selling.","Outsourcing was the bogeyman of the '90s. Protectionists portrayed it as an evil that would take American jobs away. Yes, some jobs did go offshore as people feared, but it made the global economic pie grow bigger.","The lesson is, because there will be many lemons in life, to learn to make the proverbial lemonade - and be open and honest. That's the best way of doing damage control and positioning yourself for success.","Student loan debt is the reason I don't advise students who want to become entrepreneurs to apply to elite, expensive colleges. They can be as successful if they go to a relatively inexpensive public college.","The goal should be to build a sustainable lifestyle business that does good for employees and customers - and that steadily builds wealth.","I realized that, after tasting entrepreneurship, I had become unfit for the corporate world. There was no turning back. The only regret I had was having wasted my life in the corporate world for so long.","The stereotypical successful entrepreneur is Mark Zuckerberg - the young college dropout who dreamed up a crazy idea while in his dorm room.","Ask any venture capitalist, and they will tell you that they consider the experience and completeness of the founding team to be a more important factor in their investment decision than the technology that is being built.","Business executives need to start by spelling out and communicating their values. Then they need to lead by example. This means getting rid of the bad apples and declining opportunities that bring instant wealth at the cost of selling one's soul.","The mentor-mentee relationship is ideally like that of the guru and disciple: motivated by the desire of the guru to impart knowledge to the disciple.","The natives of Silicon Valley learned long ago that when you share your knowledge with someone else, one plus one usually equals three. You both learn each other's ideas, and you come up with new ones.","You have to live in Silicon Valley and hear the horror stories. You go and hang out at the cafes, and you meet entrepreneur after entrepreneur who's struggling, basically - who's had a visa problem who wants to start a company, but they can't start companies.","In the technology world, you have to execute fast or you're out of business.","Big companies such as Google and Facebook buy startups at ridiculously high prices - not for their products, but for their people.","Whenever I write about immigration, I hear heart-wrenching stories of computer workers who are unemployed and facing severe hardship.","Hiring foreigners is more expensive and more difficult than hiring locals, because of the visa fees and long lead times for visa processing. And companies face a backlash by anti-immigrant groups for hiring foreigners. So they do it only because they have to.","Once we increase the proportion of women in technical roles, the challenge is to retain them and ease the transition to senior positions.","Writing a book is usually a full-time job that takes years. I didn't have years. So I decided to crowdsource content for the book.","The best way of dealing with the press, customers, and critics is to come clean when things go wrong and admit when you make a mistake. We are humans, and no one expects us to be perfect.","In my first company, Seer Technologies, where I was chief technology officer, we shied away from the media. We watched every word and were guarded in front of journalists.","You will find that every successful entrepreneur has suffered many setbacks. These entrepreneurs just forget to mention these when they are doing interviews with the 'Wall Street Journal' or Bloomberg TV.","The most valuable lesson I learned in dealing with the ups and downs was to invest in my employees - to do all I could for them when the times were good.","No matter how well things are going, failure and disaster are just around the corner. So celebrate the good, but be ready for the bad.","The fact is that you are never too old to innovate.","When my generation grew up, our only sources of knowledge were books, teachers, parents and friends. The encyclopedia was an item of luxury. We faced big limits in what we could learn, where we could be and who we could reach.","My message to students is that if you want to become an entrepreneur and save the world, definitely don't skip college. But go to a school that you can afford. You'll be freed from the chains of debt and succeed on your own ambition and merit.","After my health suffered due to the stress of running my second company, I had to switch careers. But I still didn't want to go back to the corporate world. So I became an academic.","If anyone tells you that you're too old to be an entrepreneur or that you have the wrong background, don't listen to them. Go with your gut instincts and pursue your passions.","During the dot-com days, one could take just about any company public and reap fortunes. All you had to do was to make sky-high projections for growth, say you were in the Internet space, and go along with unscrupulous investment bankers and their analysts.","The fastest way to get kicked out of a venture capitalist's office is to say that you want to build a business that grows steadily, focuses on employees, and creates wealth over the long term. Entrepreneurs with such ambitions are considered pariahs.","The IPO is no exit for the entrepreneur; it's the start of purgatory.","My advice to fledgling entrepreneurs is always the same: build a company that you plan to be with for the next 10 years - that is the best way to increase your chances of success.","Entrepreneurship is like a computer game in which you have to master every level before achieving success. Startups repeatedly stumble and have to go back to the drawing board. The best way to skip some levels and to increase the odds of survival is to learn from others who have already played the game.","The harsh reality is that if you are middle-aged, write computer code for a living, and earn a six-figure salary, you're headed for the unemployment lines. Your market value declines as you age, and it becomes harder and harder to get a job.","What the tech industry often forgets is that with age comes wisdom. Older workers are usually better at following direction, mentoring, and leading.","Despite what some investors say, older age is an advantage in the startup world. You know more about industries and markets, and have ideas for products that the world actually needs and a better ability to motivate and manage than a kid out of school does.","I have no doubt that my M.B.A. from New York University's Stern School of Business was one of the best investments I ever made. It helped me climb the corporate ladder and become an entrepreneur.","Most business schools are geared toward churning out investment bankers and management consultants.","When I became an entrepreneur, I had the knowledge to develop and manage budgets, market products and review legal contracts.","You may not believe in anything called a work-life balance, but your body certainly does. You need to monitor and nurture your body.","I used to have an obsession with building businesses and forgot about building health. I was focused on the destination instead of the journey. I caution you to not do the same.","I became an academic so that I could share my knowledge and experience with students.","I advise all of the entrepreneurs that I know to attend at least one entrepreneurship event every week. The worst thing an entrepreneur can do is to confine his or herself to a cubby hole.","If you don't have savings, and your co-founders are as poor as you are, and if Mom and Dad won't loan you money, then your best bet is to find people that know you - your friends. If they, too, won't help, then you're stuck seeking out angel investors.","In the U.S., PC-makers have no incentive to lower prices because it kills their profit margins. They keep adding new features like high-end retina displays and faster processors to justify their high prices."],"Vivian Campbell":["I like my guitars to be kinda worn. I don't like it when they're all shiny.","I don't know how anyone could vote Republican. It's so obvious that their only interest is keeping the rich rich.","I still have people saying to me, 'Oh, you're still together?' They don't realize Leppard's been around this whole time, because people just don't get to hear us.","I actually knew I was going to be perfect for Def Leppard, sorry I hate to say that but I knew it.","Being a songwriter, singer, and a great part of a unit is more important than being Joe Guitar Hero.","And remember: without you, all we are is loud. No pressure.","If there is any justice in the world, then eighties rock will never again serve to blight humanity as it did in that dark decade!","Def Leppard is a rock band that can sing.","It's a lot more comfortable, I must say. Ummm, I didn't think I'd be playing with another band, I kinda thought I was through with that, but I make an exception because they're nice people.","I never had a real job either. I sort of fell out of school and ended up playing guitar.","I'm a big, big blues fan and the last several years I've really invested in the blues a lot, and I think my playing is getting better because of it - not necessarily better on a technical level, but certainly on a level of appropriateness.","The nature of touring is packaging acts together that have strong catalogues of music. It's about making sure that it's a winning combination. It's really about giving people value for their money.","The Internet has definitely opened doors and leveled the playing field for musicians.","Technology has made it much easier to make and manipulate music. Studio-driven, machine-driven music does not always transcend into being a good live act. Many current acts are great live, but many cannot cut it live. The music is not organic."],"Vivian Stanshall":["I'm not different for the sake of being different, only for the desperate sake of being myself. I can't join your gang: you'd think I was a phony and I'd know it.","Why can't I be different and unusual... like everyone else?","If I had all the money I'd spent on drink, I'd spend it on drink.","Do you know what a Palmist once said to me? She said: will you let go!"],"Vivica A. Fox":["A great figure or physique is nice, but it's self-confidence that makes someone really sexy.","Um, 'Soul Food'... Another wonderful little movie that could. Here's a film that, I think our budget was maybe $6 million. We shot it in Chicago in six weeks. I was so proud of the film, because it showed America that an African-American film about family could sell, could do well, could cross over and have true meaning.","I'm gonna wait for Mr. Right to come along and take my time. I'm just enjoying just having a little me time, you know? But it's not that I'm not taking applications.","I love chilling in a cute sweatsuit and wedge sandals or sneakers.","I started in junior high doing the splits and flips and that kind of stuff. It was kind of the acceptable thing to do. But I had two older brothers, so I was a tomboy. I was the cute tomboy who could put on the skirt but then go tackle you or something. I was a little rough around the edges for a pretty woman!","I can play basketball, run track, and play volleyball, so yeah, I've always been an athlete at heart.","When you do a film, you know you're shooting for 6 or 9 weeks, you've got your cast and crew. Overall, no one can just pull the plug and say, 'This isn't working.' There's just no security on television, especially for African Americans. It's a tough market.","I think people lie on the Internet. I would prefer to meet someone in person, and I need to have chemistry when we meet and spend a little time, and have a couple of dates.","I'm just so glad that girl power is working in Hollywood.","I've retired my sneakers for stilettos, baby!","When I started off as an actress, I did at a play at the Taper Too Theatre here in Los Angeles, called 'In The Abyss Of Coney Island.' That was more of a dramatic play. It was a small theater house. This was the first time I was literally on the road, doing a play, for four months.","What I remember about that experience is that if you went to go see ' Born On The Fourth Of July' and you happened to take a bathroom break real quick or grab some popcorn, you probably missed me. It was short, but it was memorable.","I'm so glad that Hollywood and America are embracing women when they get in their 40s instead of putting us out to pasture.","I wish, to be honest with you, for African American films that we could get a few more theaters. They only open them in 1500 to 2000 for an opening weekend, and how do you expect us to compete. How can we go to certain box office levels if they don't give us more theaters?","I prefer to do movies, just for the simple fact that in TV, there's not much of a guarantee. They can pull the plug on you.","I don't like to see projects that are all black or all white. It's how life is. I do like to make sure that I do a nice black family film; that's like keeping my home base. I do other things, but I like to always come back to a positive family film, because of all the negative influences today.","Going from drama to just straight-up comedy with Tommy Davidson and Jamie Foxx - what a blast.","Cougars are all the rage! I'm so glad that Hollywood and America are embracing women when they get in their 40s instead of putting us out to pasture.","First thing I do in the morning is give thanks to God for another day, and then turn to HLN News or ESPN to see what's going on in the world.","I must always have fresh orange juice, alkaline water and hazelnut creamer for my coffee.","My favorite piece of furniture is my bed, cause' it's fluffy and so comfortable!","I feel like he inherited one of the worst economies than any president has ever, ever inherited. I have met Mr. Obama, President Obama. I supported him in his first campaign, and I feel that he deserves four more years to finish up the job that he started.","For me, I usually play the kick -butt, strong business type.","I went to state in track, won the girls' city championship, and did well in volleyball. I was a varsity cheerleader. So you know, shoot, I've got a couple of letters and things! Last I counted, I think there were eight in my mama's house.","Football players have some bodies! Oh my goodness!"],"Vivien Leigh":["Dear Lord, I'm so grateful I'm still loved.","I've always been mad about cats.","I've been a godmother loads of times, but being a grandmother is better than anything.","You know the passage where Scarlett voices her happiness that her mother is dead, so that she can't see what a bad girl Scarlett has become? Well, that's me.","English people don't have very good diction. In France you have to pronounce very particularly and clearly, and learning French at an early age helped me enormously.","I adore dancing.","One is just an interpreter of what the playwright thinks, and therefore the greater the playwright, the more satisfying it is to act in the plays.","I need something truly beautiful to look at in hotel rooms.","I'm not young. What's wrong with that?","A lucky thing Eva Peron was. She died at 32. I'm already 45.","I never found accents difficult, after learning languages.","Classical plays require more imagination and more general training to be able to do. That's why I like playing Shakespeare better than anything else.","I have just made out my will and given all the things I have and many that I haven't.","I think Edith Evans is the most marvelous actress in the world and she can look beautiful. People who aren't beautiful can look beautiful. She can look as beautiful as Diana Cooper, who was the most beautiful woman in the world.","I'm a Scorpio, and Scorpios eat themselves out and burn themselves up like me.","I'm not afraid to die.","Life is too short to work so hard.","My first husband and I are still good friends and there is no earthly reason why I should not see him. Larry and I are very much in love.","Sometimes I dread the truth of the lines I say. But the dread must never show.","My parents were French and Irish and our family even has Spanish blood-and I do so love the United States and consider myself part American.","I'm not a film star, I am an actress. Being a film star is such a false life, lived for fake values and for publicity.","Shaw is like a train. One just speaks the words and sits in one's place. But Shakespeare is like bathing in the sea - one swims where one wants.","Comedy is much more difficult than tragedy-and a much better training, I think. It's much easier to make people cry than to make them laugh.","Every single night I'm nervous. You never know how the audience is going to react.","I always know my lines.","I am going to be a great actress.","I don't know what that Method is. Acting is life, to me, and should be.","I know I am right for Scarlett. I can convince Mr. Selznick.","I loved fencing and dancing and elocution.","I think any classical training in the theatre is of enormous value.","My parents were absolutely delighted that I knew what I wanted to do.","People think that if you look fairly reasonable, you can't possibly act, and as I only care about acting, I think beauty can be a great handicap.","Streetcar is a most wonderful, wonderful play.","When I come into the theatre I get a sense of security. I love an audience. I love people, and I act because I like trying to give pleasure to people.","When I was at school at Paris, I had special lessons from Mademoiselle Antoine, an actress at the Comedie Francaise, and I was taken to every sort of play. I felt very grand."],"Vivienne Ming":["The tax on being different is massive.","Discrimination is not done by villains. It's done by us.","Gender transition isn't about gender. It's about literally making yourself a better person because you know that's a better you.","AI might be a powerful technology, but things won't get better simply by adding AI.","The bias tax is actually a loss in economy.","Estrogen's a wonderful thing. I'd be doing the dishes and suddenly be like, 'Wait a minute - why am I crying?'","My body became aligned with my identity, and it was profound.","What drives success, and the most successful students, is internal motivation.","The tax on being different is largely implicit. People need not act maliciously for it to be levied. In fact, at its heart is a laudable sentiment: 'prove it to me.' The problem is that we are requiring different levels of proof without realising it.","I want to literally make people smarter by jamming things in their brains.","Because of the tax on being different, individual actors in the labour market from different backgrounds can rationally value the same opportunities differently.","Human behavior is an enormously complex set of things, and that mixture of underlying things is different for different people, so it's not just complex, it's meta-complex.","Why did I go back to school? After working with giant snails as the manager of an abalone farm, who wouldn't be fascinated with the inner workings of the mind? They are a very contemplative species.","I have had a small handful of truly blatantly discriminatory experiences for being transgender, but the vast majority are simply the differences between being a man versus being a woman in science and business.","If you have a diverse workforce, then you have a much better chance of picking up on things that a lack of diversity would hide from them.","In 1958, my father graduated from secondary school as the highest-achieving student in the state of Kansas, earning a five-year scholarship to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He turned it down. For someone raised in a remote farming town, this would have been his opportunity to transform his life, a ticket to a bigger world.","Passing on a full scholarship to MIT would be irrational for me, but to my father and his parents, what would have been the point of spending five years at one of the world's most prestigious universities if he just ended up back on the farm?","When I went back to finish my undergrad, after a long and ignoble absence, my very first class was Intro to C for Cognitive Modeling. Unlike any educational experience before, I aced the class.","If a hero is a person on which you've made an explicit choice model yourself, mine is my father for showing me how to live a life of substance.","If you tell someone, 'Hey, your daughter is going to win a Nobel Prize someday,' it makes it less likely. If you say, 'Your son is in danger of dropping out in the ninth grade,' it could make it more likely.","I'm not enthusiastic about educational games or apps generally.","We are bad at valuing other people, and we are worse the more different they are than us.","The traditional markers people use for hiring can be wrong - profoundly wrong.","Looking at where you went to school is a proxy; you assume, because someone went to a good school, therefore they must have the qualities you desire, even though that's not actually really true.","Once you identify the intrinsically motivated people, you realize that fancy degrees can actually be a negative - that some of the people who have them are more focused on how others perceive them.","Before I came out, people always asked me math questions. But once I became a woman, they stopped. There's unintended discrimination.","After I transitioned, a lot of people said, 'I like you so much more now,' because before, I was unhappy. Making that change was a big part of becoming me. Whoever you are, as a gay man or a lesbian or a trans woman, embrace it. Turn it into an asset.","Who wants to get a worse diagnosis of their cancer, just to keep a human doctor in the job?","There are neural networks that can build whole apps from scratch - so why are we teaching high school kids to code?","It's important to me that talking about my experience not undermine those who choose differently. There can be a stigma for people who don't take the path I did, as though not having surgery means you're not really transitioning. No one should feel as though it's everything or nothing.","If my son came to me years from now and told me, 'I'm gay,' I'd say, 'That's wonderful. I'm so glad you know who you are.' But if he said, 'I want to be a woman,' I would say, 'Ahhh. This is gonna be hard. Let's get started.' Because it doesn't matter that that's where happiness lies - it's on the other side of a lot of struggle."],"Vivienne Westwood":["You have a more interesting life if you wear impressive clothes.","I was born during the war and grew up in a time of rationing. We didn't have anything. It's influenced the way I look at the world.","There's nowhere else like London. Nothing at all, anywhere.","I'm the proof - you can't throw away tradition.","I can't think without my glasses.","I think dress, hairstyle and make-up are the crucial factors in projecting an attractive persona and give one the chance to enhance one's best physical features.","You've got to invest in the world, you've got to read, you've got to go to art galleries, you've got to find out the names of plants. You've got to start to love the world and know about the whole genius of the human race. We're amazing people.","I didn't consider myself a fashion designer at all at the time of punk. I was just using fashion as a way to express my resistance and to be rebellious. I came from the country, and by the time I got to London, I considered myself to be very stupid. It was my ambition to understand the world I live in.","I am attracted to people who make this effort in knowing what suits them - they are individual and stylish.","Buy less. Choose well. Make it last. Quality, not quantity. Everybody's buying far too many clothes.","Don't just eat McDonald's, get something a bit better. Eat a salad. That's what fashion is. It's something that is a bit better.","The sexiest people are thinkers. Nobody's interested in somebody who's just vain with a hole in their head, talking about the latest thing - there is no latest thing. It's all rubbish.","Fashion is very important. It is life-enhancing and, like everything that gives pleasure, it is worth doing well.","The age in which we live, this non-stop distraction, is making it more impossible for the young generation to ever have the curiosity or discipline... because you need to be alone to find out anything.","I was the first person to have a punk rock hairstyle.","I design things to help people to hopefully express their personality.","I've always felt heroic about my life... As a child, I remember little girls in the playground moaning about how boys could do more than they could. I didn't think that was the case at all. My parents didn't treat me as a girl.","I do think we're an endangered species. But that we do have a plan to save the rainforest.","There is no hierarchy of values any more. Real progress is due mainly to human genius, and that's rare, and usually stems from a real elite, from a hierarchy.","I was so upset with what was going on in the world. I just couldn't stand the idea of being people tortured and that we even had such a thing as war. I hated the older generation, who had not done anything about it. Punk was a call-to-arms for me.","It's a philosophy of life. A practice. If you do this, something will change, what will change is that you will change, your life will change, and if you can change you, you can perhaps change the world.","It's true the punk fashion itself was iconographic: rips and dirt, safety pins, zips, slogans, and hairstyles. These motifs were so iconic in themselves - motifs of rebellion.","I was a punk before it got its name. I had that hairstyle and purple lipstick.","I just use fashion as an excuse to talk about politics. Because I'm a fashion designer, it gives me a voice, which is really good.","My clothes have always got a very strong dynamic rapport with the body - they are very body conscious, they help you to look glamorous, more hourglass, more woman.","We are so conformist; nobody is thinking. We are all sucking up stuff; we have been trained to be consumers, and we are all consuming far too much.","I don't have faith in young people any more. I don't waste time trying to communicate with them.","My biggest criticism is how can people be so easily satisfied? Even people with talent.","When I was a little girl you used to learn to sew all the holes in things, darning socks, but nobody mends things anymore.","My aim is to make the poor look rich and the rich look poor.","Home, more than anything, means warmth and bed.","In Italy they take cheap cloth and make it look expensive, but I take expensive cloth and make it look cheap. They just don't understand.","What changed our lives forever was when Malcolm had the idea to sell rock 'n roll records to trendy customers.","I'm a fashion designer and people think, what do I know?","What I'm always trying to say to the consumer is: buy less, choose well, make it last.","If you're too big to fit into fashion, then you just have to do your own fashion.","The reason why I am proud of my part in the punk movement is that I think it really did implant a message that was already there. The hippies told it to me, but punk made it something cool for people to stand up for, which is that we do not believe government, that we are against government.","I'm different from any other designer, businesswise, in that I've built this company up and I own it. I never had business hype behind me to promote my image... My image is real... I have never had marketing people telling me what to do.","I have a company, and I've got to think about that. I'm trying to do my best there, and that's a much harder task. We recycle as much as possible, and we conserve. But I've always been one to save everything - I even walk up stairs on the very inside or the very outside to not wear out the tread.","We are the most amazing creatures that this world has ever produced, but we seem to also have this herd mentality; we seem to be the most stupid, also.","I am always trying to find fabrics that are more friendly to the environment - working with Virgin Atlantic, they managed to research into this and find more eco fabrics.","There is so much that people take for granted.","Britishness is just a way of putting things together and a certain don't care attitude about clothes. You don't care, you just do it and it looks great.","I think it's important to vote.","I think feminists are unaware of the tremendous extent of the role of women in history.","We moved into the back, made it into a little 50s sitting room and started to sell the records. We had an immediate success. For one thing, these Teddy Boys were thrilled to buy the records.","Even though it was the 70s, we found old stocks of clothes that had never been worn from the 50s and took them apart. I started to teach myself how to make clothes from that kind of formula.","But, having a perfume and license, in general, is a financial necessity. A designer must, to reap back the money spent on prototypes and all that sort of thing.","It is not possible for a man to be elegant without a touch of femininity.","Personally I'm not a feminist, as I can't stand puritans.","All that self-expression has just created a generation of morons, hooked on an endless appetite for rubbish.","Every time I have to look up a word in the dictionary, I'm delighted.","People have never looked so ugly as they do today. We just consume far too much.","To me, reading a fashion magazine is the last thing I need to do. I've got books I need to read.","More people should read books. It's the most concentrated experience you can have.","I always tried to do things by example, even though I was not a very good mother regarding routines and family life.","If you see everything from the point of view of women being victims in some way, you don't see the wood for the trees. It is better to be a person than a woman.","I am in my own head most of the time.","I'm very lucky. The public happens to like me. Maybe they like me because I use every opportunity to talk about injustice.","Being part of a community with a church at its centre and singin' hymns is a great thing to do.","Real art has been... what's the word? Kidnapped? No, that's not it. But, OK, kidnapped by business.","Print some money and give it to us for the rain forests.","The bravery shown by Azza Suleiman who dared to stand up for another woman who was being beaten, and paid a heavy price in doing so, is both awe-inspiring and humbling.","Fashion is here to help make people look very important. If they have good taste and choose what suits them, I give them options on how they can do that. It's always sexy, and it's always with the same result: making women look fantastic.","I'm not sure what I think about current fashion, though. A few years ago, I would have said it's really, really bad and you hardly ever see anybody looking good. There must be some very good designers in the world.","Journalists are usually quite jealous people, especially of intellectuals who are supposed to be in fashion.","The hippie movement politicized my generation. When it ended, we all started looking back at our own history, looking, in my case, for motives of rebellion.","The muscular, athletic type is not representative of the human race, who are varied in their physique.","However, because Britain is young and exciting, I did show my second line here once or twice.","I didn't do anything at the Queen, whom I admire.","My son has followed fashion since he was a punk. He and I agree that fashion is about sex.","My clothes are very popular in Japan.","The young Japanese, especially, love to wear the latest thing and when they come to London they head for my shops as part of what they want to find in Britain.","Feminists wish women to seem like men. They're not men.","The arts have only ever interested a small minority of people, which acted as a kind of nursery to support artists.","I don't have space to enter into the examples or the history of this, so I'm left with having to make the bold statement that culture is extinct.","We based the look on rock 'n roll right from the beginning.","I was still interested in the youth rebellion but never-the-less I stopped being a victim. Stopped trying to attack the establishment realizing that it takes too much of your energy.","We wanted to step off our island and add the color of the third world. We got gold cigarette paper and stuck it around our teeth. We really did look like pirates and dressed to look the part.","But, the thing is, since I always had my own little shop and direct access to the public, I've been able to build up a technique without marketing people ever telling me what the public wants.","I think some people would love to be able to make the clothes I make - and of course, I do influence them, but they keep simplifying, and minimalism doesn't quite work.","It is extremely difficult to say how long the process actually took to finally achieve my fragrance, Boudoir, because there was a lot of time waiting around for other people.","I have considered voting Conservative because I am so against the Labour party.","If you hear Anarchy in the UK today your hair stands on end. It gives you the shivers.","The only possible effect one can have on the world is through unpopular ideas.","What I remember as a child is that other kids didn't care about suffering. I always did.","I'll tell you what I was like as a child. I was a good person. I was high-spirited but I was a big reader.","I always thought we had an environmental problem, but I hadn't realized how urgent it was. James Lovelock writes that by the end of this century there will be one billion people left.","We have got to change our ethics and our financial system and our whole way of understanding the world. It has to be a world in which people live rather than die; a sustainable world. It could be great.","I never look at fashion magazines. I find them incredibly boring.","I used to always fight for human rights. I still fight for Leonard Peltier, who's spent 35 years in jail for a crime he didn't commit.","I disagree with everything I used to say.","I tend not to like an awful lot of what is going out under my name now because it is just all product. Who needs it?","I don't follow politics much.","Prince Charles is definitely my hero; he uses his position to do only good in this world.","The last people with any ideas are young people.","Everybody looks like clones and the only people you notice are my age. I don't notice anybody unless they look great, and every now and again they do, and they are usually 70.","In history people dressed much better than we do today.","If you saw Queen Elizabeth it would be amazing, she came from another planet. She was so attractive in what she was wearing.","The French have got taste.","Our economic system, run for profit and waste and based primarily on the extractive industries, is the cause of climate change. We have wasted the earth's treasure and we can no longer exploit it cheaply.","Economists treat economics as if it is a pure science divorced from the facts of life. The result of this false accountancy is a willful confusion under cover of which industry wreaks its havoc scot-free and ignores the environmental cost.","I don't feel comfortable defending my clothes. But if you've got the money to afford them, then buy something from me. Just don't buy too much.","I love designing at the moment, I'm so happy with my work.","I've got a real sense of three-dimensional geometry. I can look at a flat piece of fabric and know that if I put a slit in it and make some fabric travel around a square, then when you lift it up it will drape in a certain way, and I can feel how that will happen.","I didn't want to be a fashion designer, and for a good half of my career I didn't like it. I always wanted to do other things.","If you wear clothes that don't suit you, you're a fashion victim. You have to wear clothes that make you look better.","I own my own company, so I've never had businessmen telling me what to do or getting worried if something doesn't sell. I've always had my own access to the public, because I started off making my clothes for a little shop and so I've always had people buying them.","I think it is a good thing to buy less and choose well - it's good for the environment and to be fair it's also good for me because my clothes are quite expensive.","In the morning, I practice 15 minutes of yoga.","I very rarely watch my own fashion shows, but the makeup for my Fall 2011 show was just brilliant.","My beauty secret is absolutely no sun.","I don't watch television and I rarely go to the cinema, but I recently watched 'The King's Speech' on a flight. It was so beautiful and so simple.","At one time, I was very angry. I even treated fashion like a kind of crusade: you were either with us or against us, that kind of feeling. Now I know we need ideas, not kicking down a door.","I think I've got wiser.","I'd like to be the last person alive in the world! Yes, I'd like to know what happens.","When I first saw a picture of the crucifixion, I lost respect for my parents. I suddenly realised that this is what the adult world is like - full of cruelty and hypocrisy.","The capitalist system is about taking from the Earth and from the other great commodity, labour. What's happening with this system is that the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer, and the only way out of it is supposed to be growth. But growth is debt. It's going to make the situation worse.","Fashion has become so whatever. I don't think there are any stones left to unturn.","Popular culture is a contradiction in terms. If it's popular, it's not culture.","I don't notice anybody unless they look great, and every now and again they do, and they are usually 70.","I have been asked what would I ban immediately if I could. Advertising.","I talk to fashion designers and say I want some money to save the rainforest, and they say, 'Oh, I agree with you completely Vivienne. Yes, climate change, it's definitely happening,' but they don't feel that they can do anything about it; they don't even think 'Well let's stop it!'","I have too much product, and I'm trying to rein it in and sell more of my main collection. I wish you didn't have to design so often; it would be good if you could keep on selling the same things for a few years and not have to do new things all the time.","I eat only vegetables and fruit, and to me it's the most aspirational diet because it's so easy. It's quite simple, the cooking I do.","I do not approve of museums trying just to get people to come in. Whistler was very, very clear on this.","I'm frugal. I'm not a very acquisitive woman. I never waste food. If you prepare your own food, you engage with the world, it tastes alive. It tastes good.","I wish you didn't have to design so often. Try to do quality and cut down on quantity. I think fashion is very, very important.","Women fight for democracy and engage in the world. But they shouldn't try and be copying men and be masculine; they should anchor on the home and build on those fundamentals.","The main message of Climate Revolution is that climate change is caused by the rotten financial system we've got, designed to create poverty and rip off any profits for a small amount of rich people. Meanwhile, it destroys the earth."],"Vladimir Bukovsky":["I should like to underline: no people, no country, in which a Communist dictatorship has been established, ever found its way out of it.","This power, this authority, Soviet power: they killed everybody who could make any resistance, who could explain his own way of thinking and who could follow his own way of thinking, of believing.","The experience of opposing mass movements was acquired by the KGB during perestroika. It was then that the politicians decided to develop and nourish mass movements for their purposes.","Usually, the leaders appear in the moment of the highest stress, when it is time, speaking symbolically, to go to the barricades. Then people, clever, capable, but focused on their own tasks, will leave their immediate occupations and go to the barricades, because there is nowhere to hide.","The real leaders cannot appear in the peaceful time; nor can the serious opposition emerge from within the peaceful atmosphere. Without an open confrontation, there is no opposition!","A single economy makes the constant adjustments necessary to facilitate trade impossible.","The dream of socialists, the Maximum Programme, has always been to eliminate the private property, the family and the nation state. With the private property they have not succeeded, but they continue on the path of destruction of the family and the nation.","Socialism is the gradual and less violent form of communism, and socialist is the project of the European Union, which was born in Maastricht in 1992. The intent was to save socialism in Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the predictable bankruptcy of the welfare state in the West as well."],"Vladimir Horowitz":["Perfection itself is imperfection.","For me, the intellect is always the guide but not the goal of the performance. Three things have to be coordinated, and not one must stick out. Not too much intellect because it can become scholastic. Not too much heart because it can become schmaltz. Not too much technique because you become a mechanic.","Imitation is a caricature. Any imitation. Find out for yourself.","My future is in my past and my past is my present. I must now make the present my future.","I am a general. My soldiers are the keys and I have to command them.","I must tell you I take terrible risks. Because my playing is very clear, when I make a mistake you hear it. If you want me to play only the notes without any specific dynamics, I will never make one mistake. Never be afraid to dare.","Behind the notes, something different is told, and that's what the interpreter must find out. He may sit down and play one passage one way and then perhaps exaggerate the next, but, in any event, he must do something with the music. The worst thing is not to do anything.","I may play the same program from one recital to the next, but I will play it differently, and because it is always different, it is always new.","The most important thing is to make a percussive instrument a singing instrument. Teachers should stress this aspect in their instruction, but it seems that very few of them actually do.","My face is my passport.","Scriabin, as you know, is a mystic composer. His music is supersensuous, superromantic, and supermysterious. Everything is super; it is all a little overboard. Anyway, my parents were pleased that I played for him.","You have to open the music, so to speak, and see what's behind the notes because the notes are the same whether it is the music of Bach or someone else.","To be able to produce many varieties of sound, now that is what I call technique, and that is what I try to do. I don't adhere to any methods, because I simply don't believe in them. I think each pianist must ultimately carve his own way, technically and stylistically.","As far as practicing is concerned, I usually try to do one to two hours a day. It isn't good to practice too much, or your playing becomes too mechanical.","Always there should be a little mistake here and there - I am for it. The people who don't do mistakes are cold like ice. It takes risk to make a mistake. If you don't take risk, you are boring.","If you want me to play only the notes without any specific dynamics, I will never make one mistake.","I was a terrible student. For me, to take a book home was a trial.","I loved singing. But can you imagine my voice in an opera house?","Scriabin slept with Chopin under his pillow, and I slept with Wagner under mine. I could not concentrate on memorizing Bach fugues, but I had all of 'Gotterdammerung' in my fingers.","I studied with Felix Blumenfeld, who had studied piano with Anton Rubinstein and composition with Tchaikovsky. Felix, my professor, was the right hand of Anton Rubinstein. Blumenfeld knew his playing by heart, from every angle.","It is important for the musician to learn as much about the composer as possible and to study the music he has written. Then, even a short piece by Brahms or Chopin can be played with much more understanding.","I tried playing for the public, and I selected music that I thought would be pleasing to them. Times are different now. Today, I play the music I want, and I just try to do my best.","Life is very busy now. I find that in today's cities, the public is very tired after working the whole day. When concerts start at eight o'clock, the wife pushes the husband to go to the concert, where some promptly fall asleep!","Without false modesty, I feel that, when I'm on the stage, I'm the king, the boss of the situation.","The score is not a bible, and I am never afraid to dare. The music is behind those dots."],"Vladimir Kramnik":["I am convinced, the way one plays chess always reflects the player's personality. If something defines his character, then it will also define his way of playing.","Every top player has his own style, just as every painter has his own personal signature.","Chess is an infinitely complex game, which one can play in infinitely numerous and varied ways.","Only he, who penetrates into the depth of the game, can express his personality in it.","For us chess players the language of artist is something natural.","At some point he seemed to lose all confidence trying to break down the Berlin Wall. He was still fighting as only Kasparov can, but I could see it in his eyes that he knew he wasn't going to win one of these games.","I don't like to show my emotions at the board, not because they might give something away to an opponent, but because that's my style: I like to keep it to myself.","I feel that my relationship with Kasparov now is much the same as it had been before the match - good. As for his reaction, well it can't be nice to lose your title after so long, but he was very generous.","An impatient person plays differently than a more patient person.","But with the Berlin, I was able to allow him to get near, but not quite near enough, and I knew where to draw the line with the fortresses I had set up.","Even if you play perfectly, a fault of your opponent's can destroy the entire beauty of the game.","For me art and chess are closely related, both are forms in which the self finds beauty and expression.","I believe every chess player senses beauty, when he succeeds in creating situations, which contradict the expectations and the rules, and he succeeds in mastering this situation.","I made a better decision in choosing my team. Sure, I had a bigger choice of players to choose from - but I couldn't have asked for a harder working group of players who did an incredible job.","In chess one cannot control everything. Sometimes a game takes an unexpected turn, in which beauty begins to emerge. Both players are always instrumental in this.","In this respect I suppose I'm the total opposite of Garry. With his very emotive body language at the board he shows and displays all his emotions. I don't.","It made a big difference to my match stamina. I couldn't imagine I would have been so energetic during the match - it really gave me a welcomed extra boost!","My way of playing is very different and Karpov plays very differently as well.","No - I'm quite calm inside during the game for most of the time - not 100%, but generally very calm.","Now, two years have passed and the situation is completely different: no one wants to organise this match.","Okay, when you start to fight for equality, like Anand did in 1995, you could end up losing game 10, like he did, without putting up any kind of fight.","Once he had selected the path he was going down he really had to stick with it in a 16 game match. He had to try and hit in the one direction but unfortunately for him - though fortunately for me! - he hit in the wrong direction.","So basically it's very simple: to start with, if you want to win the match, you shouldn't be afraid of him. There are still many, many things to do, but above all this is the most important: Don't be scared of him!","The Berlin Defence suited my strategy for the match. I had a defensive strategy - Actually, I had in my pocket some other sharper stuff to fall back on - but first I wanted to try the defensive strategy with Black and it worked so well.","The development of beauty in chess never depends on you alone. No matter how much imagination and creativity you invest, you still do not create beauty. Your opponent must react at the same highest level.","The strength of the playing ability is much more important. Only if the strength of the opponent's playing ability is comparable, does the game develop.","When I speak of the beauty of a game of chess, then naturally this is subjective. Beauty can be found in a very technical, mathematical game for example. That is the beauty of clarity.","With the Berlin I was able to set up a fortress that he could come near but not breach.","You know, our ratings after this match will be very close - I think I can also become the world number one in the not too distant future. However, I'm sure that Garry will also have something to say about this!"],"Vladimir Lenin":["A lie told often enough becomes the truth.","One man with a gun can control 100 without one.","The goal of socialism is communism.","Give me four years to teach the children and the seed I have sown will never be uprooted.","No amount of political freedom will satisfy the hungry masses.","There are no morals in politics; there is only expedience. A scoundrel may be of use to us just because he is a scoundrel.","Fascism is capitalism in decay.","If it were necessary to give the briefest possible definition of imperialism, we should have to say that imperialism is the monopoly stage of capitalism.","The oppressed are allowed once every few years to decide which particular representatives of the oppressing class are to represent and repress them in parliament.","The best way to destroy the capitalist system is to debauch the currency.","Sometimes - history needs a push.","When one makes a Revolution, one cannot mark time; one must always go forward - or go back. He who now talks about the 'freedom of the press' goes backward, and halts our headlong course towards Socialism.","Can a nation be free if it oppresses other nations? It cannot.","Democracy is indispensable to socialism.","The way to crush the bourgeoisie is to grind them between the millstones of taxation and inflation.","Without revolutionary theory there can be no revolutionary movement.","While the State exists there can be no freedom; when there is freedom there will be no State.","When there is state there can be no freedom, but when there is freedom there will be no state.","It is true that liberty is precious; so precious that it must be carefully rationed.","Our program necessarily includes the propaganda of atheism.","Crime is a product of social excess.","If Socialism can only be realized when the intellectual development of all the people permits it, then we shall not see Socialism for at least five hundred years.","Capitalists are no more capable of self-sacrifice than a man is capable of lifting himself up by his own bootstraps.","The press should be not only a collective propagandist and a collective agitator, but also a collective organizer of the masses.","Give us the child for 8 years and it will be a Bolshevik forever.","Freedom in capitalist society always remains about the same as it was in ancient Greek republics: Freedom for slave owners.","The most important thing when ill is to never lose heart.","Every cook has to learn how to govern the state.","Without a revolutionary theory there cannot be a revolutionary movement.","Under socialism all will govern in turn and will soon become accustomed to no one governing.","It is impossible to predict the time and progress of revolution. It is governed by its own more or less mysterious laws.","Communism is Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country.","Despair is typical of those who do not understand the causes of evil, see no way out, and are incapable of struggle. The modern industrial proletariat does not belong to the category of such classes.","A revolution is impossible without a revolutionary situation; furthermore, not every revolutionary situation leads to revolution.","The government is tottering. We must deal it the death blow an any cost. To delay action is the same as death.","To rely upon conviction, devotion, and other excellent spiritual qualities; that is not to be taken seriously in politics.","Politics begin where the masses are, not where there are thousands, but where there are millions, that is where serious politics begin.","Any cook should be able to run the country.","The history of all countries shows that the working class exclusively by its own effort is able to develop only trade-union consciousness."],"Vladimir Nabokov":["The breaking of a wave cannot explain the whole sea.","Life is a great sunrise. I do not see why death should not be an even greater one.","Literature and butterflies are the two sweetest passions known to man.","Caress the detail, the divine detail.","The pages are still blank, but there is a miraculous feeling of the words being there, written in invisible ink and clamoring to become visible.","Complacency is a state of mind that exists only in retrospective: it has to be shattered before being ascertained.","The cradle rocks above an abyss, and common sense tells us that our existence is but a brief crack of light between two eternities of darkness.","Existence is a series of footnotes to a vast, obscure, unfinished masterpiece.","My loathings are simple: stupidity, oppression, crime, cruelty, soft music.","A writer should have the precision of a poet and the imagination of a scientist.","I think it is all a matter of love: the more you love a memory, the stronger and stranger it is.","Happy is the novelist who manages to preserve an actual love letter that he received when he was young within a work of fiction, embedded in it like a clean bullet in flabby flesh and quite secure there, among spurious lives.","The evolution of sense is, in a sense, the evolution of nonsense.","Nothing revives the past so completely as a smell that was once associated with it.","Revelation can be more perilous than Revolution.","Satire is a lesson, parody is a game.","A work of art has no importance whatever to society. It is only important to the individual.","Nothing is more exhilarating than philistine vulgarity.","Discussion in class, which means letting twenty young blockheads and two cocky neurotics discuss something that neither their teacher nor they know.","I confess, I do not believe in time.","The more gifted and talkative one's characters are, the greater the chances of their resembling the author in tone or tint of mind.","It is a short walk from the hallelujah to the hoot.","Genius is an African who dreams up snow.","To play safe, I prefer to accept only one type of power: the power of art over trash, the triumph of magic over the brute.","No author has created with less emphasis such pathetic characters as Chekhov has.","I have often noticed that after I had bestowed on the characters of my novels some treasured item of my past, it would pine away in the artificial world where I had so abruptly placed it.","The good, the admirable reader identifies himself not with the boy or the girl in the book, but with the mind that conceived and composed that book.","Imagination, the supreme delight of the immortal and the immature, should be limited. In order to enjoy life, we should not enjoy it too much.","There is only one school of literature - that of talent.","It is hard, I submit, to loathe bloodshed, including war, more than I do, but it is still harder to exceed my loathing of the very nature of totalitarian states in which massacre is only an administrative detail.","I would like to spare the time and effort of hack reviewers and, generally, persons who move their lips when reading.","All my stories are webs of style and none seems at first blush to contain much kinetic matter. For me style is matter.","Turning one's novel into a movie script is rather like making a series of sketches for a painting that has long ago been finished and framed.","I cannot conceive how anybody in his right mind should go to a psychoanalyst.","There is nothing in the world that I loathe more than group activity, that communal bath where the hairy and slippery mix in a multiplication of mediocrity.","You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style.","Style and Structure are the essence of a book; great ideas are hogwash.","There are aphorisms that, like airplanes, stay up only while they are in motion.","A novelist is, like all mortals, more fully at home on the surface of the present than in the ooze of the past.","Poetry involves the mysteries of the irrational perceived through rational words.","I think like a genius, I write like a distinguished author, and I speak like a child.","A masterpiece of fiction is an original world and as such is not likely to fit the world of the reader.","Some people, and I am one of them, hate happy ends. We feel cheated. Harm is the norm."],"Vladimir Potanin":["Frankly speaking, I decided to become a businessman at the moment when I understood that it is possible, because I grew up in a country where it was not possible. There existed even a special article in the penal code of the Soviet Union which punished entrepreneurial activity.","After I met my partner, Mr. Protherow, we decided to start a banking project, and at the same time we started to think already about a business on a bigger scale. At the very beginning we thought more about gaining money, to have a normal life with our families, etc.","For me, my father was, and still is, a symbol of qualified persons in the Ministry of Foreign Trade under Soviet conditions.","Everybody starts with creating or acquiring certain property in order to create the material to work with. When we started our business, we thought first of all about development, how to grow, and we managed to do this, even with all the difficulties and all the difficult rules that were implemented in Russia at that time.","It is not good to demonstrate your luxury and your wealth: to rub it in the faces of others is insulting. So you should be modest; try not to insult people by showing that you can do what they cannot.","It is not so much that I am a blue-blooded oligarch: I just don't feel like an oligarch.","Many people say the privatisation was unfair: that is true - it was unfair. That is a fact: some people became rich and others did not. Unfair does not mean illegal, but it was inevitably unfair.","I am not trying to say that I am poor and that I don't like beautiful things. But I don't like luxury for luxury sake or in the sense of showing off luxury.","The Interros strategy toward various assets generally depends on the stage of their development and level of their maturity.","To create a big company, you need more partners, as it is hard to handle such a project alone. Such projects bring access to the expertise and management resources of the partners, and their connections above all.","There are ways of fighting for your interests. I never do something in business that I wouldn't do in life.","For a rich and reasonably successful guy, it is impossible not to enjoy your job; otherwise, why would you spend so much time and effort doing it?

When you are in the middle of something, there is a different pace of life."],"Vladimir Prelog":["To grasp the essence of chirality, it is instructive to withdraw for a moment from the familiar three-dimensional world into a two-dimensional one, into a plane, and enquire what chirality means there.","I was born on July 23rd, 1906, in Sarajevo in the province of Bosnia, which then belonged to the Austrian-Hungarian Monarchy and later, in 1918, became part of Yugoslavia.","The period 1924 to 1929 was spent studying chemistry at the Czech Institute of Technology in Prague, Czechoslovakia. The supervisor of my thesis was Professor Emil Votocek, one of the prominent founders of chemical research in Czechoslovakia.","The close of my studies with a degree of a Dr. Ing. in 1929 coincided with the great economic crisis, and I was not able to find an academic position. I was therefore very grateful for a position in the newly created laboratory of G.J. Driza in Prague where rare chemicals were produced on small scale.","For many years, when still a Yugoslav citizen, I was already a Swiss patriot, and in 1959, I obtained Swiss citizenship. However, I consider myself a world citizen, and I am very grateful to my adopted country that it allows me to be one.","An object is chiral if it cannot be brought into congruence with its mirror image by translation and rotation.","Many objects of our three-dimensional perceptual world are not only chiral but appear in nature in two versions, related at least ideally, as a chiral object and its mirror image.","A planar geometrical figure with more than three vertices can be decomposed into a set of triangles, and it can be reconstructed from a set of triangles."],"Vladimir Putin":["Sometimes it is necessary to be lonely in order to prove that you are right.","The centuries-old history and culture of India, majestic architectural monuments and museums of Delhi, Agra and Mumbai have a unique attractive force.","Those who fight corruption should be clean themselves.","Whoever does not miss the Soviet Union has no heart. Whoever wants it back has no brain.","Nobody and nothing will stop Russia on the road to strengthening democracy and ensuring human rights and freedoms.","We need business to understand its social responsibility, that the main task and objective for a business is not to generate extra income and to become rich and transfer the money abroad, but to look and evaluate what a businessman has done for the country, for the people, on whose account he or she has become so rich.","The ability to compromise is not a diplomatic politeness toward a partner but rather taking into account and respecting your partner's legitimate interests.","Terrorism has no nationality or religion.","Everything will probably never be OK. But we have to try for it.","NATO was built to counteract the Soviet Union in its day and time. At this point there is no threat coming from the Soviet Union, because there is no Soviet Union anymore. And where there was the Soviet Union once, there is now a number of countries, among them the new and democratic Russia.","We need to use the United Nations Security Council and believe that preserving law and order in today's complex and turbulent world is one of the few ways to keep international relations from sliding into chaos. The law is still the law, and we must follow it whether we like it or not.","No one doubts that poison gas was used in Syria. But there is every reason to believe it was used, not by the Syrian Army, but by opposition forces to provoke intervention by their powerful foreign patrons, who would be siding with the fundamentalists.","I love soccer.","You must obey the law, always, not only when they grab you by your special place.","I have a private life in which I do not permit interference. It must be respected.","The point of conservatism is not that it prevents movement forward and upward, but that it prevents movement backward and downward, into chaotic darkness and a return to a primitive state.","I spend a little time every day to play sports.","My notion of the KGB came from romantic spy stories.

Eavesdropping on friends is unacceptable.","Russia needs a strong state power and must have it. But I am not calling for totalitarianism.","Our society, including the liberals, must understand that there must be order.","Anyone who doesn't regret the passing of the Soviet Union has no heart. Anyone who wants it restored has no brains.","No one wants the United Nations to suffer the fate of the League of Nations, which collapsed because it lacked real leverage. This is possible if influential countries bypass the United Nations and take military action without Security Council authorization.","At last, Russia has returned to the world arena as a strong state - a country that others heed and that can stand up for itself.","I have a very positive attitude to anyone who is protecting the environment, but it's inadmissible when people are using it as a means of promoting themselves, using it as a source of self-enrichment. I don't want to name any specific examples... but often, environmentalism is used to blackmail companies.","I have always loved and avidly read the novels of Jack London, Jules Verne and Ernest Hemingway. The characters depicted in their books, who are brave and resourceful people embarking on exciting adventures, definitely shaped my inner self and nourished my love for the outdoors.","One can truly enjoy his or her life only while experiencing it, and it is inevitably related to a certain level of risk.","My English is very bad.","The philosophy of FIFA is to expand world soccer space, to spread out the world football space.","Terrorists are always a threat to someone.

An end must be put to this. As never before, it is vital to unite forces of the entire world community against terror.","The worst thing for a politician is to try and cling to power by every possible means, and focus only on that.","I am never guided by a possible assessment of my work.","Stalinism is linked with a cult of personality and massive violations of the law, with repression and camps.

It is extremely important.","Above all, such sports as judo, in my view, teach people to relate to each other. They teach us to respect a partner, teach us to understand that an externally weak partner can not only put up worthy resistance, but, if you relax and take too much for granted, may even win.","Journalism, as concerns collecting information, differs little if at all from intelligence work. In my judgment, a journalist's job is very interesting.","It's a historical phenomenon that in 250 years, a nation could move from a colony into the most prosperous nation of the world and the leader of the world.

What matters is not an external display of this faith, but the inner state of the soul.","It's Russia some people would like to get rid of. They are still afraid of our nuclear deterrent. We have our own foreign policy whether they like it or not.","In 1995, Russia virtually gave Chechnya de facto statehood and independence even though, de jure, it didn't recognize Chechnya as an independent state. And I would like to emphasize strongly that Russia withdrew all of its troops, we moved the prosecutors, we moved all the police, dismantled all the courts, completely, 100 percent.","For Russia, there is not and there may not be another political option but democracy. However, Russian democracy is... not at all the realization of standards imposed on us from outside.","If the nation is not capable of preserving itself and reproducing, if it loses it vital bearings and ideals, then it doesn't need foreign enemies - it will fall apart on its own.","Yes, life in Chechnya so far looks more like a life after a natural disaster.","The Chechnya problem is a centuries-old problem. The thing is that today, fundamentalists and terrorists are exploiting those centuries-old problems to accomplish their own objectives that have nothing to do whatsoever with the interests of Chechnya.","I see that not everyone in the West has understood that the Soviet Union has disappeared from the political map of the world and that a new country has emerged with new humanist and ideological principles at the foundation of its existence.","I think happiness is love.","Nobody should have any illusion about the possibility of gaining military superiority over Russia.

Russia has a certain natural advantage because it also borders the Pacific Ocean.","At least in Russia, you cannot just go and tap into someone's phone conversation without a warrant issued by court. That's more or less the way a civilized society should go about fighting terrorism.","The state security bodies should not be seen as an institution that works against society and the state; one needs to understand what makes them work against their own people.","McCain fought in Vietnam - I think that he has enough civilian blood on his hands.","We must stop using the language of force and return to the path of civilized diplomatic and political settlement.","The more intermediaries there are, the more problems there are.","Our military might is the guarantor of Russia's security and independence.","The United States and Russian security services regularly exchange information.","In the 20th century, the Soviet Union made the state's role absolute. In the long run, this made the Soviet economy totally uncompetitive. This lesson cost us dearly. I am sure nobody wants to see it repeated.","I myself know some people who are gay.

We intend to participate in the elaboration of common rules in the energy sector and to abide by rules which are developed together.","My personal position is that society must keep children safe.","In the modern world, those who are weak will get unambiguous advice from foreign visitors which way to go and what policy course to pursue.","I am not prejudiced in any way.","No references to the need to fight terror can be an argument for restricting human rights.","Our aims are absolutely clear: They are a high living standard in the country and a secure, free and comfortable life.","The democratic choice Russian people made in the early 90's is final.","The path towards a free society has not been simple. There are tragic and glorious pages in our history.","To pay more is the easy way. In fact, the solution possibilities to the problem are many.","Political activities in Russia should be as transparent as possible. Financing political activities from abroad is something the state should keep an eye on.","If one looks at the map of the world, it's difficult to find Iraq, and one would think it rather easy to subdue such a small country.","How can a bureaucrat or a politician be trusted if he says loud words for the sake of Russia's good while trying to take his funds, his money abroad?","I love the Russian classics very much, the Russian classical literature. But I also read modern literature. As far as Russian literature is concerned, I am very fond of Tolstoy and Chekhov, and I also enjoy reading Gogol very much.","I would prefer to abandon the terminology of the past. 'Superpower' is something which we used during the cold war time. Why use it now?","Russia is opposed to the proliferation of mass destruction weapons, including nuclear weapons, and in this context we call upon our Iranian friends to abandon the uranium enrichment programme.","In accordance with the Constitution of the Russian Federation, the issues of foreign policy and defense are fully in the hands of the president.","Protest actions and propaganda are two slightly different things.","As far as oligarchs who acquire sports team abroad, and invest money abroad, I wouldn't treat this phenomenon as something bad.","U.S. society doesn't want to play the role of international policeman.","I think we should not control the Internet.","At a certain point, we saw the police cracking down on the Occupy Wall Street activists. I won't call the actions of police appropriate or inappropriate.","If there are people who act outside the law, then the state must use legal means to impose law in the interests of majority.

If you come out in support of someone like me, you're going to be accused of trying to ingratiate yourself.","Cromwell is just as much of a bloody dictator as was Stalin.","I think it's fine when the mayor of the biggest city in Russia consults the president.","I would like to draw your attention to the fact that in Russia, unlike in one third of the world's countries, being gay is not a crime.","In many countries today, moral and ethical norms are being reconsidered; national traditions, differences in nation and culture are being erased.","A figure who receives money from abroad for his political work, and thus serves some foreign interest, cannot be a politician in Russia.","Russia does not and cannot have any political choice but democracy. I want to say, and even stress, that we share those universal democratic principles taken around the whole world.","When the States already had nuclear weapons, and the Soviet Union was only building them, we got a significant amount of information through Soviet foreign intelligence channels.","Russian democracy is the power of the Russian people with their own traditions of national self-government, and not the realisation of standards foisted on us from outside.","Demographers affirm that choosing to have a second child is already a potential choice in favour of a third.","I am convinced that the norm in Russia should become a family with three children.","The Russian parliament has condemned the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.","My parents told me that children were taken from their families in 1941, and my mother had a child taken from her - with the goal of saving him.","The Russian people and Russian culture are the linchpin, the glue that binds together this unique civilization.","The Eurasian union is a project meant to preserve the identities of nations and the historic Eurasian community in the new century, in a new world.","Libya is divided into tribes and clans.","Back in the mid-18th century, in 1745-1747, Ossetia was the first to become part of the Russian Empire. At that time, it was a united entity; North and South Ossetia were one state.","Construction of the first gas pipeline system was started during the 1960s, at the height of the Cold War, and for all those years, from the 1960s until this day, Russia has been fulfilling its contract obligations in a very consistent and reliable way, regardless of the political situation.","Russia and China are very natural partners. We are neighbors with an immense common border.","The Russian people have unilaterally made their choice in direction of democracy in the early '90s. They will not be led astray. Nobody should be having any doubts.","Why does the world dislike Russia? I do not think that we are unloved or considered to be ignorant.","In line with international law, only the U.N. Security Council could sanction the use of force against a sovereign state. Any other pretext or method which might be used to justify the use of force against an independent sovereign state are inadmissible and can only be interpreted as an aggression.","China has created very good investment tools, including an entire network of very large funds. The Russian Private Investment Fund works with some of those funds, with China's largest investment funds.","The leaders of the world's largest economies agreed during the November 2008 G20 summit not to create barriers hindering global trade and capital flows. Russia shares these principles.","The unjustified swelling of the budgetary deficit and the accumulation of public debts are just as destructive as adventurous stock-jobbing.","The Declaration on Strategic Partnership between India and Russia signed in October 2000 became a truly historic step. The developments in the first decade of the 21 century confirmed that it was a particularly significant and timely step.","The growing economic potential of India and Russia is mutually complementary in many respects.","My working and personal relationship with President Obama is marked by growing trust. I appreciate this."],"Vladimir Zhirinovsky":["Here in Russia,, in many cities, people are irritated by Caucasian intrusion. Caucasians come from foreign countries; they are ubiquitous: in markets, shops, hotels, restaurants. They misbehave, and in this sense we have feelings similar to those that the Germans have toward the Turks and the French toward Algerians.","We must force the government to stop the bird migration. We must shoot all birds, field all our men and troops... and force migratory birds to stay where they are.","The West will have to choose: either to come to terms with Russians, or to receive a retaliatory blow. This retaliatory blow will not be by means of war. We will resort to the same weapon: nationalism.","The true reason of Ms. Rice's attack against Russia is very simple. Condoleezza Rice is a very cruel, offended woman who lacks men's attention.","If Russia rises, it means that the USA falls down.","There is no such thing as Russian fascism. You won't find a single Russian who considers Russians to be a superior race and who advocate expulsion of aliens.","The USA experiences the crisis of ideological and moral values.","Americans try to talk about positive family values, although the actual state of things is disastrous.","I'm against the capturing of Eastern Orthodox temples.","A mother-in-law is better than a single and childless political persona, though.","And, for instance, Baptists, Adventists, Lutherans, Pentecostals - let them exist on line with others.","Europe has united, China is growing speedily and Russia possesses immense power in terms of fuel resources. The US administration cannot do anything about it.","I believe in full freedom for Christians of all denominations.","I didn't sign any contracts, and I didn't see any oil.","I mean, in general, the danger is from Oriental faiths and Islam.","I've never signed any contract and never received a cent from Iraq.","Let Catholics build their own churches and works.","Military police is very timely for our army.","Russia is an Eastern Orthodox country.","The civilized world needs to think about a decision when single politicians are not allowed to stay in power.","The matter of international relations is very subtle and exquisite.","The only thing I oppose is persecuting of Eastern Orthodox priests and temples.","There is no problem with the opening of new houses of prayer for Lutherans and Pentecostals.","We don't need this religious cosmopolitanism. It's no good.","We'll limit in all ways the work of religious faiths which are foreign to us.","We'll surely stop the work of all western Christian and eastern religions, and also Islam."],"Voltaire":["Judge a man by his questions rather than his answers.","God gave us the gift of life; it is up to us to give ourselves the gift of living well.","The art of medicine consists in amusing the patient while nature cures the disease.","Appreciation is a wonderful thing: It makes what is excellent in others belong to us as well.","Faith consists in believing when it is beyond the power of reason to believe.","Tears are the silent language of grief.","Optimism is the madness of insisting that all is well when we are miserable.","It is better to risk saving a guilty man than to condemn an innocent one.","It is difficult to free fools from the chains they revere.","Common sense is not so common.","Friendship is the marriage of the soul, and this marriage is liable to divorce.","Life is thickly sown with thorns, and I know no other remedy than to pass quickly through them.

These daughters have too long dominated the earth.","What is tolerance? It is the consequence of humanity. We are all formed of frailty and error; let us pardon reciprocally each other's folly - that is the first law of nature.","Perfection is attained by slow degrees; it requires the hand of time.","No problem can withstand the assault of sustained thinking.","Each player must accept the cards life deals him or her: but once they are in hand, he or she alone must decide how to play the cards in order to win the game.","Injustice in the end produces independence.","The public is a ferocious beast; one must either chain it or flee from it.","Doubt is not a pleasant condition, but certainty is absurd.","When it is a question of money, everybody is of the same religion.","Think for yourselves and let others enjoy the privilege to do so, too.","Prejudices are what fools use for reason.","Tyrants have always some slight shade of virtue; they support the laws before destroying them.","One great use of words is to hide our thoughts.","Love is a canvas furnished by nature and embroidered by imagination.","Chance is a word void of sense; nothing can exist without a cause.","Better is the enemy of good.","He must be very ignorant for he answers every question he is asked.","By appreciation, we make excellence in others our own property.","A witty saying proves nothing.","It is not enough to conquer; one must learn to seduce.","Paradise was made for tender hearts; hell, for loveless hearts.","Clever tyrants are never punished.","Satire lies about literary men while they live and eulogy lies about them when they die.","It is not love that should be depicted as blind, but self-love.","Man is free at the moment he wishes to be.","Let us read and let us dance - two amusements that will never do any harm to the world.","The world embarrasses me, and I cannot dream that this watch exists and has no watchmaker.","The sovereign is called a tyrant who knows no laws but his caprice.","The truths of religion are never so well understood as by those who have lost the power of reason.","To the living we owe respect, but to the dead we owe only the truth.","The mouth obeys poorly when the heart murmurs.","In the case of news, we should always wait for the sacrament of confirmation.","Opinion has caused more trouble on this little earth than plagues or earthquakes.","The progress of rivers to the ocean is not so rapid as that of man to error.","We never live; we are always in the expectation of living.","The secret of being a bore... is to tell everything.","The safest course is to do nothing against one's conscience. With this secret, we can enjoy life and have no fear from death.","Ice-cream is exquisite - what a pity it isn't illegal.","I have never made but one prayer to God, a very short one: 'O Lord make my enemies ridiculous.' And God granted it.","I die adoring God, loving my friends, not hating my enemies, and detesting superstition.","Let the punishments of criminals be useful. A hanged man is good for nothing; a man condemned to public works still serves the country, and is a living lesson.","This self-love is the instrument of our preservation; it resembles the provision for the perpetuity of mankind: it is necessary, it is dear to us, it gives us pleasure, and we must conceal it.","It is vain for the coward to flee; death follows close behind; it is only by defying it that the brave escape.","Originality is nothing but judicious imitation. The most original writers borrowed one from another.","To the wicked, everything serves as pretext.","If God created us in his own image, we have more than reciprocated.","We cannot always oblige; but we can always speak obligingly.","We are rarely proud when we are alone.","It is lamentable, that to be a good patriot one must become the enemy of the rest of mankind.","The true triumph of reason is that it enables us to get along with those who do not possess it.","In general, the art of government consists of taking as much money as possible from one class of citizens to give to another.","Time, which alone makes the reputation of men, ends by making their defects respectable.","In every author let us distinguish the man from his works.","Woe to the makers of literal translations, who by rendering every word weaken the meaning! It is indeed by so doing that we can say the letter kills and the spirit gives life.","Fear follows crime and is its punishment.","We must distinguish between speaking to deceive and being silent to be reserved.","History is only the register of crimes and misfortunes.","Our country is that spot to which our heart is bound.","It is the flash which appears, the thunderbolt will follow.","Let us work without theorizing, tis the only way to make life endurable.","He is a hard man who is only just, and a sad one who is only wise.","He who has not the spirit of this age, has all the misery of it.","There are truths which are not for all men, nor for all times.","It is not sufficient to see and to know the beauty of a work.

It has not been God's pleasure that we should be informed of their abode.","All men are born with a nose and five fingers, but no one is born with a knowledge of God.","I am very fond of truth, but not at all of martyrdom.","Nature has always had more force than education.","What then do you call your soul? What idea have you of it?

If it's just on me and I don't have nothing to do, I'm going to be lazy. On the football field, it's every single day, every play, knowing that people are depending on me to make my play. That helps me elevate my game to another level.","I got, like, 120 pairs of glasses and 800 pairs of sneakers.","The crazy thing is I got all of these shoes, and probably 80 percent of them I've never worn before. I've worn all the glasses. I sleep in them, bend them up a little bit. Glasses are on all the time except when I'm at practice or at work.","I really don't look at myself as a defensive end or a linebacker or a cornerback or a safety. I don't try to limit myself to just rushing the passer or dropping back in coverage or being a run-stopper; I try to be great at football.","I like the sci-fi channel. Just science in general. I came across a segment on time travel and how time travel is possible. We create a spaceship that's moving at almost the speed of light, we go in that spaceship in outer space, and we fly around for a year, when we get back to Earth, Earth would've aged 10 years.","I like Lil Wayne's style. His style probably influences me the most. Basically, he's just wearing exactly what he feels like wearing. He goes to the club, and he's got shorts and a wife-beater on. That shows you what type of celebrity he is and what he is able to pull off, fashion-wise. I try to be in that same lane.","I've had asthma my whole life. My mom used to hook the generator up to the Suburban and roll the extension cord all the way down to the football field and have my nebulizer hooked up to that so I could take treatments in between offense and defense. I was in the fifth grade when she started doing that.","Out of high school, I was, like, 202-205 pounds. My rookie season, I was, like, 245; my second year, I was 255. My third year, I got up to like 272, and I tore my ACL. I don't know if my weight was part of the cause of that, but I got hurt, so I just tried to re-evaluate my situation."],"Vonda Shepard":["My mom always wanted to go to Maryland to live there. Baltimore, actually. She had a best friend who lived there. She kept saying that she was going to move there and make that her home, but she only made it halfway across the country and got stuck in Iowa.","I could have become a mime or a juggler, but I became a singer-songwriter instead.","Ally McBeal walks down the streets crying, looking for the right man. I don't do that.","I do a lot of touring, yes, and I have my whole life ever since I was 19 years old, when I used to tour with Al Jarreau, Rickie Lee Jones, and Jackson Browne as a side musician.","The two together are a really great combo: the family life and then being able to go play some shows and write.","James Ralston, my guitar player, has performed with Tina Turner for about 22 years. Jim Hanson on bass has played with Johnny Cash, Rodney Crowell and Bruce Springsteen, and they're fantastic musicians and amazing singers they get a really cool vocal sound together.","Playing clubs is the ultimate - you see the faces; you hear the 'clicking' glasses - I love all that atmosphere and seeing people's mouths singing the words to the songs.","I've been through the entire gamut of the music industry - I've been playing in clubs since I was 14, and I've been on Warner Bros, on Sony - I've had lots of successes and some serious times of struggle.","My advice is if you have to do music, then do it! There's no choice in your heart and your soul - unless you have that kind of great need, desire and determination, it's pretty tough out there!","I just kept making records, touring in Europe a lot, and then I had a baby in 2006, so my life has been very, very much family-orientated.","I can't really stop doing the music because it really feeds me.","At first, I wanted to start my own label, but it was such a full-time job that it became too much.","We've been waiting for a format like triple-A where you can hear Crowded House, Joni Mitchell and R.E.M.","Success was overnight, but it was a very long night.","I had a hard-core cult following of at least 12.","I always give the audience a variety because I want to make sure they hear the favorites and all that.","I seem to be drawn to the really romantic songs.","I have played lots of clubs since I was 14, but I always did my own music.","The biggest similarity between me and my character is that we've both played clubs for 20 years. In real life, the clubs aren't quite as controlled - and my hair isn't quite as in place as it is on 'Ally McBeal.'","I don't have much time for TV shows, but if I did, I'd watch 'Seinfeld' reruns.","Having drive is a big part of success, along with integrity. You need to have a clear vision of what you want and take the steps to achieve it, even if that sometimes means playing gigs in tiny clubs.","The last thing I wanted was a big paycheck but no inspiration or support.","My nature is to worry about everything too much.","I thought nothing would ever happen for me. My whole life had been geared toward being a singer, and it wasn't clicking.","For me, if 'Maryland' became half of what 'Searchin' My Soul' became, as far as radio play goes, I would be thrilled.","I'm not just a chick singer who sings high all the time.","My nature is... well... I'm a searcher by nature. I'm constantly searching for something; that's why I have a song called 'Looking for Something.' How do I do it? I read a lot of spiritual books; I meditate.","My stint with 'Ally McBeal' is something I never planned nor expected.","I spend a lot of time working in the studio as a producer, not just a singer.","I love pop music, but I don't want to be Celine Dion.","I was born singing. My father tells this story about when I was 3 weeks old, how I would rock in the crib and sing in the crib all night long. My crib would roll across the floor in the middle of the night. Finally, my father nailed its legs to the floor.","I had a very artistic bohemian childhood. My father was an actor and a mime.","There was a singer-songwriter who slept on our couch for a year when I was about 7 or 8. She used to sing these songs for us, and I loved it. It was magical to watch her.","Although I don't come from a musical background, I was given piano lessons along with my sisters, but I wasn't what you would call a good student. I tended to write songs rather than do scales.","I would advise anyone starting out as a singer/songwriter to play live as much possible. You never know who might be in the audience.","Starting young has definitely helped my success. All the experience I gained by touring with other players as a backing artist helped to prepare me for my own big break."],"Vusi Mahlasela":["There have been so many great moments, and I feel so blessed every day.","If you are bitter, you are like a dry leaf that you can just squash, and you can get blown away by the wind. There is much more wisdom in forgiveness.","I want my music to be accessible to every listener because I know that I really have something to say in terms of really, you know, removing thorns from people, thorns that really makes us unaware that we are bleeding with these thorns, like pain, grief, jealousy and so on.","Faith is a really important part of my life and inspires me in all facets of my life, including my songwriting and my singing.","I feel blessed to be a musician, and I know it's a power given to me from God that I must use in a very positive way.","Playing at home in Mamelodi is always so special to me, and I cherish those moments dearly."]}
